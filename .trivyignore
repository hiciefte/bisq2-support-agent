# CVE-2025-6985: XXE vulnerability in HTMLSectionSplitter class
# This vulnerability affects the HTMLSectionSplitter class in langchain-text-splitters 0.3.x
# which uses unsafe XSLT parsing. Our codebase only uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,
# not HTMLSectionSplitter, so we are not affected by this vulnerability.
# The only fix is version 1.0.0a1 (alpha), which may have breaking changes.
# Suppressing until a stable 1.0.0 release is available.
# Reference: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m42m-m8cr-8m58
