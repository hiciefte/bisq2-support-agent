Who is the shop owner of bisq2? \"incentivizing sellers to burn bsq to get reputation\". Who is making money on it? And why is someone \"stealing\" a customer if the shop denies for him to sell in his shop because of a to low reputation. The guy wanting to sell would simply ask the person who wants to buy in the shop but finds no seller, to go outside of the shop, so one can sell to him there. Because the shop doesn't allow for one to sell in the shop because one is having a to low of a reputation.",
    "ground_truth": "the bisq platform has rules, and anyone using it is expected to follow said rules, trying to circumvent them is also rude, besides sellers do find buyers and make profits at it, or they wouldn't burn bsq to increase their reputation, and buyers do find sellers, as long as they take one of the available offers, considering how most markets have at least one seller you have but to choose",

If I now send the fiat via normal SEPA (up to 6 working days), my btc wallet could be closed the time when the fiat is recieved by the trader. What should I do?

My current software versions: Bisq 1: v1.9.21 Bisq 2: v2.1.7 I have already burned 10 BSQ in Bisq 1 following the step-by-step guide from Bisq 2, but nothing has appeared in my Bisq 2 reputation. I also locked (bonded) 10 BSQ for 50,000 blocks using the step-by-step instructions, and still nothing is reflected in my Bisq 2 reputation. I\u2019ve double-checked the Profile ID used for the burn pre-image and for the bonding salt field. The transactions have many confirmations already, and it has been more than 12 hours.
