      "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your experience. In Bisq Easy, sellers invest significantly in their reputation, which discourages scamming behavior. If you're facing issues, opening a mediation request is the right step.

If a seller's offer remains untaken for a long time, it can indeed create a frustrating situation for both parties. \n\nHowever, taking trades outside of Bisq 2 can lead to consequences, such as potential bans or penalties, as it undermines the trust and security model that the platform is built upon.
