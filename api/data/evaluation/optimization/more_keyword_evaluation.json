      "answer": "In Bisq Easy (Bisq 2), reputation plays a crucial role in trust between buyers and sellers. If an offer remains untaken for a long time, it typically indicates a lack of sellers with high enough reputation willing to fulfill it. Trading outside of Bisq 2 is discouraged and can lead to consequences, including potential bans, since it undermines the platform's security and trust mechanisms.\n\nTo mitigate risks, buyers should carefully choose sellers with higher reputation scores, while sellers should focus on building and maintaining their reputation to attract more trades.",
