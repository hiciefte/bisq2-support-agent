      "answer": "When you buy Bitcoin on Bisq, the escrow system works as follows:\n\n1. **Trade Initiation**: You select an offer to buy BTC and confirm the trade. This action locks the Bitcoin in a multisig escrow account, protecting both you and the seller.\n\n2. **Payment**: You send the specified fiat amount to the seller using your chosen payment method. This payment occurs outside of Bisq, but you must notify the Bisq application that the payment has been initiated.\n\n3. **Confirmation**: Once the seller receives your payment, they confirm this in the Bisq application. Only after this confirmation will the Bitcoin be released from escrow to your wallet.\n\n4. **Completion**: Upon confirmation of payment by the seller, the trade is complete, and you can withdraw your Bitcoin.\n\nThe escrow system ensures that neither party can cheat the other since the Bitcoin remains locked until the payment is confirmed.

This process involves the traders working with a mediator to create and sign a transaction that releases their funds.\n\n4. **Security Deposits**: To further enhance security, both parties must post a security deposit in addition to the trade funds. If one party fails to follow the trading protocol, a portion or all of their deposit can be forfeited.\n\n5. **No Central Authority**: The entire process is decentralized, meaning there's no central authority managing the funds.
