As sellers build reputation through burning BSQ, bonding, or trade history, their limits increase. Buyers do not have specific limits beyond what sellers offer.",
      "answer": "In Bisq Easy, the reputation system serves as the primary security mechanism for trading. Here's how it works:\n\n- **Reputation Score:** Sellers build their reputation by burning or bonding BSQ, importing account age from Bisq 1, or accumulating trade history. A higher reputation score increases trust and the likelihood of successful trades.\n\n- **Minimum Reputation Requirement:** The minimum reputation score to sell on Bisq Easy is set at **10,000**. Sellers with less than this score won't have their offers taken by buyers.\n\n- **Trade Limits:** The maximum amount a seller can offer in a trade is directly tied to their reputation score. However, all trades are subject to overall limits of **$6 minimum** and **$600 maximum**. This prevents issues related to Bitcoin price volatility.\n\n- **Enhanced Value for BSQ:** BSQ that is burned or bonded for reputation counts double during the first year, helping sellers improve their limits faster.\n\n- **Buyer Strategy:** Buyers are encouraged to select sellers with higher reputation scores to minimize risks, as sellers need to invest significantly in their reputation.\n\nUnderstanding these aspects helps both buyers and sellers navigate trades more confidently in the Bisq Easy environment.",

      "answer": "Bonded roles in Bisq are special positions within the Bisq DAO that require contributors to lock up BSQ tokens as a guarantee of good behavior. This ensures accountability and security for various network functions. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n### Types of Bonded Roles\n\n1. **System Roles**: \n   - Must be performed by specifically authorized contributors approved by the DAO.\n   - **Examples**:\n     - **Mediators**: Assist users during trades, providing support if issues arise. They cannot control funds but can report bad behavior.\n     - **Moderators**: Monitor the platform, handle user reports, and enforce rules.\n\n2. **Delegable Roles**: \n   - These can be delegated to others but still require a BSQ bond.\n\n### Bonding Process\nTo become a bonded role holder, contributors typically follow this process:\n1. Create a proposal outlining qualifications for the role.\n2. Discuss the proposal publicly within the community.\n3. If there\u2019s consensus, submit a formal \"Bonded Role Proposal\" with sufficient BSQ to cover the bond.\n4. The DAO votes on the proposal.\n5. Upon approval, the BSQ bond is locked, and the contributor can start the role.\n\n### Importance\n- **Accountability**: Bonding ensures that role holders have a vested interest in acting correctly.\n- **Security**: Helps maintain the integrity of the decentralized network by preventing malicious actions.\n\nIn summary, bonded roles are crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of the Bisq network, ensuring that contributors are accountable for their actions.",

A mediator can help propose a solution.\n2. **Arbitration**: If either party rejects the mediator's suggestion or if mediation fails, the delayed payout transaction can be published, allowing for arbitration as a final step.\n\nThis structure aims to ensure that most disputes are resolved without needing to escalate to arbitration, just like in Bisq 1.",
