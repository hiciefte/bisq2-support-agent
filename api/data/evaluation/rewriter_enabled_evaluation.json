Bisq uses SegWit addresses to reduce these fees.\n\n2. **Trading Fees**: Bisq charges trading fees that can be paid in BTC or BSQ. BSQ fees are typically discounted by 50% compared to BTC fees.\n\n3. **SEPA Fees**: SEPA itself does not charge fees for sending or receiving payments. However, individual banks may impose fees, so check with your bank regarding any charges related to SEPA transactions.\n\n4. **Transaction Costs**: The total mining fee and trading fee will be displayed before confirming an offer.

      "answer": "The **reputation system in Bisq Easy** is a key component that helps ensure trade security without requiring security deposits. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n- **Reputation Score**: Sellers earn reputation through various means such as burning or bonding BSQ, importing account age from Bisq 1, and accumulating trade history. The higher the seller's reputation, the more likely a trade will be successful.\n  \n- **Minimum Requirement**: The minimum reputation score to participate as a seller is **10,000**. Sellers below this score cannot have their offers taken by buyers.\n\n- **Trade Limits**:\n  - **Maximum Trade Amount**: A seller's maximum offer amount is directly tied to their reputation score. Higher reputation allows for larger offers.\n  - **Overall Trade Limits**: The range for any Bisq Easy trade is set between **6 USD** (minimum) and **600 USD** (maximum), which helps mitigate risks from Bitcoin price volatility.\n\n- **Incentives for Reputation**: BSQ that is burned or bonded for reputation contributes double its initial value within the first year, promoting long-term engagement and quicker reputation growth.\n\n- **Buyer Consideration**: Buyers should prioritize sellers with high reputation scores to minimize risks in their trades.\n\nBy relying on reputation instead of security deposits, Bisq Easy fosters a trust-based trading environment where sellers are incentivized to maintain good standing to attract buyers.",
