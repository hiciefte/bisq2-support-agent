This reputation system incentivizes sellers to enhance their trustworthiness, resulting in higher visibility and potentially better prices for their offers.\n\nWhile buyers benefit from dealing with trusted sellers, it's essential to note that the Bisq DAO does not profit from the BSQ burned for reputation.

If an offer remains untaken due to sellers with high enough reputation not accepting it, it doesn't directly result in consequences like a ban for negotiating outside of Bisq.
