      "answer": "If a mediation proposal is not accepted and the case moves to arbitration in Bisq 1, the following occurs:\n\n1. **Time-Locked Transaction:** The trader who initiates arbitration publishes a time-locked delayed payout transaction. This transaction sends all funds in the multisig escrow (both traders' funds) to the Burning Men, which are donation addresses.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Arbitrator:** Traders need to collaborate with the arbitrator to clarify the details of the case.\n\n3. **Outcome:** If the arbitrator agrees with the trader's claim, they will reimburse the trader directly from their own funds.\n\n4. **Reimbursement Request:** The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO for the funds paid out to the trader.\n\nThis arbitration process is designed to be a last resort and is only available after a specific time period has passed (10 days for altcoin trades and 20 days for fiat trades).

If your balance is below this threshold, the transaction will fail, even if the visible amount seems adequate.\n\n3. **Transaction Sizes**: Each Bisq trade involves multiple transactions (maker fee, taker fee, deposit, payout). The cumulative fees can be higher than expected, especially for takers, which may lead to a shortfall even if your balance looked sufficient prior to the trade.\n\n4. **Dust Limit**: If your remaining BSQ after accounting for fees falls below the dust limit (0.03 BSQ), it cannot be used for transactions, causing a failure in fee payment.\n\nAlways double-check the total fees and the current BSQ to BTC rate before completing a trade in Bisq 1 to avoid these issues.",
