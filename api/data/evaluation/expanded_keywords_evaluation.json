      "answer": "If a mediation proposal in Bisq 1 is not accepted, the case moves to arbitration. Here's what happens:\n\n1. **Rejection Triggers Arbitration**: Arbitration is initiated when one or both traders reject the mediator's proposed solution.\n\n2. **Publishing the Time-Locked Transaction**: The trader requesting arbitration must publish the time-locked delayed payout transaction. This transaction sends all funds in the multisig escrow to the Burning Men.\n\n3. **Collaboration with Arbitrator**: Once arbitration is initiated, the trader collaborates with the arbitrator to clarify the details of the case.\n\n4. **Arbitrator's Decision**: If the arbitrator sides with the trader, they will personally reimburse the trader.\n\n5. **Reimbursement Process**: The arbitrator will then seek reimbursement from the Bisq DAO for the funds they paid out.\n\nArbitration is a last resort and is designed for extreme situations, ensuring that funds are handled securely without trusting a third party.",

      "answer": "In Bisq 1, your BSQ balance might appear sufficient, but your trade-fee payment can still fail due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Mining Fees vs. Trading Fees**: \n   - Trading fees are paid to the Bisq DAO and can be paid in either BTC or BSQ. If you choose to pay with BSQ, ensure you have enough to cover the entire fee, which is subject to dynamic market changes.\n   - Mining fees are separate and are required for Bitcoin transactions. If the estimated mining fees have increased since you last checked, you may need more BTC to complete the transaction.\n\n2. **Transaction Size**: \n   - The required mining fees depend on the size of the transaction in bytes, not just the amount of BTC. Even if your BSQ or BTC balance looks adequate, the mining fee for larger transactions may exceed your available funds.\n\n3. **Dust Limits**: \n   - There are minimum thresholds for trading fees. If your available BSQ or BTC is below these minimums, the transaction will fail. For example, the minimum trading fee to avoid dust is 0.00005 BTC or 0.03 BSQ.\n\n4. **Network Conditions**: \n   - The Bitcoin network's congestion can affect mining fees. If the mempool is busy, fees can spike, leading to your available balance not being sufficient at the time of the transaction.\n\nAlways check the estimated mining fees displayed in the Bisq interface before confirming a trade to ensure you have enough to cover both trading and mining fees.",
