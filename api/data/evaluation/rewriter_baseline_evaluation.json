      "question": "Is that safe?",
      "ground_truth": "Bisq Easy trades without escrow rely on the seller's reputation. While there is no multisig escrow like in Bisq 1, the reputation system provides some security. Sellers with higher reputation have more to lose. For larger amounts, consider using Bisq 1 which has full multisig protection.",
      "answer": "**Bisq's safety is rooted in its design.** Here are the key points to consider:\n\n- **Security Mechanisms**: Bisq implements multiple layers of security, including:\n  - **2-of-2 multisignature escrow** (in Bisq 1) ensuring that funds can only be released when both traders agree.\n  - **Mandatory security deposits** that deter fraud by requiring both parties to commit funds, refunded upon successful trades.\n  - A **3-tier dispute resolution system** to handle trading disputes effectively.\n\n- **Chargeback Risk**: When trading fiat currencies, there's always some inherent chargeback risk. Bisq mitigates this by:\n  - Supporting payment methods with lower chargeback risks (e.g., avoiding PayPal).\n  - Implementing age limits for payment accounts, restricting trade sizes until trust is established.\n\n- **Privacy**: Bisq operates on a peer-to-peer network using Tor, ensuring your trading activities remain private and secure. There\u2019s no KYC or central storage of data.\n\nIn summary, while Bisq has strong security and privacy features, always exercise caution, especially when trading fiat.",
