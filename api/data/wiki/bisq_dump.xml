&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Bisq 2 is the successor to the original Bisq ([[Bisq 1|Bisq v1]]). It has been developed from the ground up to allow for multiple trade protocols to be accessed via a single decentralized exchange platform. 

At the initial launch of Bisq 2 will support only one trading protocol &amp;#x27;[[Bisq Easy]]&amp;#x27;. Over time more trading protocols will be added.

Once the Bisq Multisig protocol is implemented in Bisq 2, the old version of Bisq can fade out. [[Bisq 1]] will still find its usage as Bisq DAO management tool and for BSQ-BTC trading.

Similar to Bisq v1, Bisq 2 will be a decentralized bitcoin exchange that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

* Bisq 2 is a desktop application that works across platforms.
* Bisq 2 allows users to choose between multiple trading protocols to find the best fit for their preference. Aspects like privacy and security, convenience, costs and trade duration will differ and the user can make the choice. 
* Bisq 2 is a peer-to-peer network that enables users to find people to trade with, make and take offers to buy and sell bitcoin, communicate with their trading peers and when necessary access support.
* Bisq 2 is privacy focused, no verified accounts or KYC will be required and run over the Tor network (as well as I2P in future).
* Bisq 2 is self custodial. Your keys are always under your control.
* Bisq 2 is open source (AGPL) and built and maintained by contributors who form the Bisq DAO.

== Why Bisq 2? ==

Bisq v1 is a powerful tool for bitcoiners that want to be able to buy and sell bitcoin peer to peer whilst maintaining their privacy, not having to undergo arduous KYC processes, and keeping control of their bitcoin.

Bisq v1 was launched on mainnet in April 2016 and whilst there has been constant improvements to the trade protocol and user interface over the years it was designed from the outset to support only one trade protocol. As bitcoin has developed and Bisq user base has grown there has been an obvious need for Bisq to expand its offerings to offer more options to its users for example trades over lightning and access via mobile devices. Bisq 2 is the first step to develop something that is built from the ground up to be more accessible to users and provide access to multiple trading protocols that can expand over time.

The core benefits of Bisq 2 are:

=== Multiple Trade Protocols ===

Bisq 2 will offer a variety of [[trade protocols]] for users. Each trade protocol will come with its own benefits and tradeoffs. Having multiple protocols allows users to choose what trade protocols are best for them based on; convenience, security, miner costs, trade fees, privacy, available support etc. All trade protocols can be accessed independently and users can switch between protocols for different trades. 

The follow trade protocols are on the roadmap:

* [[Bisq_Easy|Bisq Easy]]: Reputation based trading with no security deposit requirements (included in the initial launch)
* Bisq Multisig: Similar to the current trade protocol used by Bisq 1 but with some improvements

* Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC &lt;-&gt; mainnet BTC

* Liquid Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC &lt;-&gt; Liquid BTC

* Liquid Multisig: Bisq Multisig ported to Liquid network with faster confirmation, lower fees and better privacy (confidential transactions)

* Bisq Lightning: LN BTC &lt;-&gt; Fiat (chain of multiple protocols: Liquid Submarine Swaps, Liquid Multisig)
* Liquid Swaps: Atomic swap of Liquid BTC &lt;-&gt; Liquid assets like L-USDT

* BSQ Swaps: Atomic swap of BSQ &lt;-&gt; BTC
* Monero Swaps: Cross chain atomic swap of BTC &lt;-&gt; XMR

Find out more about the [[Trade_Protocols|trade protocols]] Bisq 2 will use.

=== Multiple privacy networks ===
Bisq 2 will support multiple privacy networks. Initially it will only support Tor but I2P support is already implemented but in an experimental state. Upcoming privacy networks like Nym could be added in future if they fit the requirements.

Having multiple networks adds resilience in case one network has availability issues (as it happened multiple times with Tor when DoS attacks decreased the Tor network stability and with that Bisq&amp;#x27;s availability and stability).

The P2P network has also a built in DoS protection using Proof of Work and comes with many improvements compared to the Bisq 1 P2P network.

===Multiple Identities ===

Bisq 1 used a single onion address and key pair which represent the user&amp;#x27;s identity. Bisq 2 will allow users to create multiple identities, giving the user more control and better privacy. The user can choose between the highest level of convenience and use just one global identity for all interactions (like Bisq 1) or at the other extreme use a separate identity for any type of interaction (e.g. use a different identity for each trade as well as for each chat room). And anything in between (separating fiat and altcoin trades,...).

Find out more about how Bisq 2 manages [[Identity|identities]].

=== Multiple applications ===

The reference implementation will be the Bisq 2 JavaFx desktop application.

But there is also ongoing work on a HTML interface with a headless application to be used on personal Node projects like Start9, Umbrel, MyNode,...

Beside that there will be a REST API (useful for trading bots,...).

Bisq Easy can be implemented as a mobile app (at least for Android there are no conceptual or technical hurdles).

=== Multiple wallets ===

At launch time Bisq 2 will not include a wallet, but work is underway to support multiple wallet options.

Bitcoin core as a full wallet is already implemented (but not exposed in the UI). For users who do not want to run a full Bitcoin node, there will be a light wallet option. Currently Electrum is implemented but we might change to another solution.

For the different trade protocols there will be the specific wallets required. E.g. for Liquid the Elements wallet is already integrated. For Monero Swaps we need to provide an interface for using the Monero wallet. Find out more about the [[Bisq_2_Wallet|Bisq 2 wallet]].

=== Bonded Roles ===

The contributors providing the resources and infrastructure for Bisq 2 will require their roles to be bonded. This concept was also used in Bisq 1 but as it was not strictly enforced by the system, not all roles are secured by bonds as it was envisioned. In Bisq 2 having set up a BSQ bond is mandatory for most roles and node operators and enforced by the system.

Find out more about the [[Bisq_2_Roles|Bisq 2 roles]].

== Bisq 1 vs Bisq 2 ==

When Bisq 2 is launched it will initially only use the one trade protocol &amp;#x27;[[Bisq Easy]]&amp;#x27; therefore the differences are based on a 2-of-2 multisig protocol (Bisq 1) vs a reputation based trade protocol (Bisq Easy).

== Bisq Easy ==

Bisq Easy was designed for new Bitcoin users who have not yet purchased Bitcoin and therefore cannot use Bisq 1 due the requirements of the security deposit. A lot of effort was put into making it as simple to use as possible.

Bisq Easy tries to replicate the experience of a novice Bitcoiner visiting a Bitcoin meetup and getting a gentle and friendly introduction into the Bitcoin world as well as the opportunity to purchase their first Bitcoin from a helpful peer. This is inspired by the famous Satoshi Squares (early days informal Bitcoin meetups), which was also the initial name inspiration for Bitsquare - the previous brand name of Bisq.

The seller is expected to be an experienced Bitcoin and Bisq user and to have built up a reputation. The seller should be helpful and serve as guide through the newbie&amp;#x27;s first Bitcoin trade.

Bisq Easy tries to be a much more social experience as it is the case on Bisq 2. It also provides a &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; section where newbies can learn about important topics like wallets, privacy and security. The various sections for chat rooms should also boost the social and communicative aspect of Bisq Easy.

=== Main differences for BTC buyers === 

Initially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow for users to buy bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no miner fees. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to buy bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs.

The tradeoff for Bisq 2 is that the security of the trade will be based on seller reputation as opposed to Bisq 1 where the security of the trade is based on bitcoin collateral secured in the multisig. 

Therefore, Bisq 2 will be cheaper and more convenient to trade for bitcoin buyers but at the cost of less robust security than Bisq 1. This is opposed to Bisq 1 that will be more secure but also more expensive, in terms of trade and miner fees, and less convenient for bitcoin buyers. 

Bisq 2 will initially be more suitable for users wanting to complete trades for small amounts of bitcoin, whereas, Bisq 1 will continue to be suitable for users wanting to complete trades for larger amounts of bitcoin.

=== Main differences for BTC sellers === 

Initially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow users to sell bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no security deposit. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to sell bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs.

Sellers on Bisq 2 will be expected to build their reputation. This can be done in multiple ways but to achieve a high reputation they will need to either burn BSQ and / or create a BSQ bond that locks in a specific amount of BSQ for a specified length of time.

The first iteration of Bisq 2 will have more buyers than sellers. That means a small number of sellers will be servicing the buyers. Bitcoin sellers on Bisq 2 will be required to make a judgement on how best to achieve their reputation and what the cost of doing so will involve. Bitcoin seller&amp;#x27;s using Bisq 2 will also need to account for the fact that bitcoin buyers are not putting down a security deposit for their trades so there will likely be a higher trade abandonment than in Bisq 1.

It is expected that some bitcoin sellers currently active on Bisq 1 may choose to experiment with Bisq 2, and the number of buyers and sellers on Bisq 2 will grow over time.

As in Bisq 1 seller&amp;#x27;s will be able to choose the price above or below market they wish to sell their bitcoin for.

Due to the requirements on bonds and the potential higher effort on communication with a newbie Bitcoiner, the price premium can be expected to be much higher than in Bisq 1 (maybe 10-15% above market). The Seller is the one who sets the price.

== How Bisq 2 keeps data private ==

Bisq 2 achieves data privacy for users in the same way as Bisq 1:

* Using Bisq requires no registration or centralized identity verification
* Every Bisq application connects to the Bisq network with a Tor hidden service (as well as I2P in future)
* Bisq has no central servers or databases to record data
* Data is encrypted such that trade details are readable only by counter-parties

== How Bisq 2 resists censorship ==

Bisq 2 achieves censorship resistance in the same way as Bisq 1:

* Bisq’s network is a fully distributed P2P network, and thus difficult to shut down
* Bisq’s network is built on top of Tor (I2P), and thus inherits Tor’s own censorship resistance
* Bisq is an open source project and a DAO, not a company; it is not incorporated, and thus cannot be dis-incorporated

== Advanced configurations for Bisq 2 ==

For users that want to tinker with the default config setting. Bisq 2 supports users to add a config file in the data directory which overrides the default config.

This can be useful instead of dealing with command line options. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.

For more info see the GitHub pull request [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/pull/2201 here].

== Installation ==

=== Download and verify ===

Bisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.

To import the key in Linux and MacOS:

 &lt;code&gt;curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import &lt;/code&gt;

GPG will return &amp;quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&amp;quot;, this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)

To verify the installer against the signature:

 &lt;code&gt;gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}&lt;/code&gt;

Replace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.

In Windows you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].

=== Known issues with installation ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;MacOS&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Notarization was removed from the build pipeline because of the risk of Apple certification revocation ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions/6341 GitHub issue]). Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS.

Please follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section &amp;quot;If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer&amp;quot;.

If you are using macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to execute the following in your terminal to be able to start Bisq 2:

&lt;code&gt;sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq2.app&lt;/code&gt;

You will be prompted to enter your password to execute the command as super user, and this should allow you to start Bisq 2 normally.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Windows&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

The developer code signing was removed for the same reason as above. You can ignore the warning after having verified the installer.

There are known issues with antivirus software: Bisq or Tor processes could be prevented from running, files could get deleted in the data directory [2] or the application directory [1]), or startup could be delayed to the point that Tor is terminated, and a lockfile is left behind preventing Bisq from being started again (this requires you to restart Windows in order to remove the lockfile). These issues are currently being evaluated and addressed.

Windows suffers from a much wider attack surface compared to Linux or OSX, please consider using a different operating system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files): C:\Users&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq2

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data): C:\Users&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq2

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Linux&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; 

Debian users: if you have issues starting Bisq, run &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq2/bin/Bisq2&lt;/code&gt;

If your Linux distribution does not support .deb files please follow these instructions:

&lt;code&gt;
cd ~/Downloads

mkdir tmp

cd tmp

ar x ../Bisq-64bit-2.1.2.deb

sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz

sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq2 /opt/
&lt;/code&gt;

The above is not tested in all distributions, if you encounter issues please report them [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/issues here].</text></revision></page><page><title>Bisq 1</title><ns>0</ns><id>609</id><revision><id>3803</id><timestamp>2024-12-13T19:27:46Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Bisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2, designed to facilitate the acquisition of bitcoin with zero trade fees and without the requirement of a security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol intended for novice bitcoin buyers seeking a non-KYC option and aiming to be efficiently onboarded by experienced and knowledgeable sellers that are familiar with the Bisq platform.

Bisq Easy is currently the only trade protocol for [[Bisq 2]]. More [[Trade_Protocols|trade protocols]] are planned for the future.

== Bisq Easy Trade Protocol Specifics ==

=== Trade fees ===

There are no trade fees for buyers or sellers for trading on Bisq Easy.

=== Mining fees ===

Buyers will not have to pay any mining fees when they trade on Bisq Easy.

Sellers will need to pay any fees required to send the bitcoin to the buyer after receiving their payment.  For on chain transactions the seller is responsible for paying mining fees needed to send the bitcoin to the buyer&amp;#x27;s waller.  For lighting transactions the seller is responsible for paying any routing fees needed to pay the buyer&amp;#x27;s ln invoice.  

=== Security mechanisms ===

The security of the trade is proportional to the reputation of the seller.

As Bisq Easy is [[reputation based]], and reputation provides a fairly low security model, it means traders on Bisq Easy are suited only to rather small amounts of bitcoin.

By default buyers can only exchange messages with sellers that have a certain level of reputation, however, buyers can opt-out from that protection.

Trading with sellers without reputation, or very low reputation, carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.

=== Currencies / Payment Methods ===

Bisq Easy buyers and sellers can trade bitcoin for any type of fiat.

Fiat buyers and sellers can choose whatever type of payment method they agree upon for fiat transfer.

=== Dispute mechanisms ===

Buyers and sellers trading on Bisq Easy can access mediation support should anything go wrong with their trade.

Mediators will be able to:

* Help facilitate the successful completion of the trade 
* Confirm fiat / altcoin and bitcoin payments
* Help cancel trade if needed
* Report a trader who severely violated the trade rules to the moderator who can ban the user.

Depending on the form of reputation used, a fraudulent seller can get their bonded BSQ confiscated by the DAO or their Bisq 1 onion address banned. As all reputation is linked to the user profile, a banned user profile disables their reputation.

=== Security deposit requirements ===

Bisq Easy trades do not require any security deposits from either the buyer or seller.

=== Privacy benefits / trade-offs ===

As no security deposits are required buyers and sellers using fiat will be revealing their bank account details to users that might end up backing out of the trade. If a user backs out of a trade there is less possibility to penalize them than if they had to trade using a security deposit. The seller can report a buyer who cancelled the trade after the payment account data has been transmitted to the moderator, who can ban the buyer.

== How to buy bitcoin on Bisq Easy ==

Buying Bitcoin with Bisq Easy is recommended for small fiat amounts, or as a starting point if you still have no Bitcoin that you can use for the security deposits of other trade protocols.

You can opt for two ways to find a trading partner to get some Bitcoin: taking an existing offer or creating one.

=== Creating an offer ===
Creating an offer is a great way to establish your own terms and simply wait for someone to match what you are after. It is also the right option if you don&amp;#x27;t find any offers with the right premium or payment methods in the market you want to trade in. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and create a new offer in it:

Begin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bisq Easy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on the left panel, and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Offerbook&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on the top tab. 

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 1.png|frameless]]

Each different national currency has its own market. You can click on the displayed pair to open a selector where you can choose the currency you would like to trade in. In this example, we are interested in buying some Bitcoin by paying with Euros, so we will select the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BTC/EUR&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; pair, but you should select whatever currency you are using. Afterward, click on the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Create offer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; button on the right-hand side.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 2.png|frameless]]

You will now enter the offer creation wizard. The first step will be to choose between buying or selling Bitcoin. Select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Buy Bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 3.png|frameless]]

On the following screen, you will be asked for confirmation on which currency you want to pay your Bitcoin with. The selected currency will be the one you selected in the previous &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Offerbook&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; screen. You can change your mind here if needed. Since for this example we want to move forward with Euros, we don&amp;#x27;t need to change anything on this screen, and we can simply click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 4.png|frameless]]

On the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods are you willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;SEPA&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Revolut&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 5.png|frameless]]

Besides the presented Payment Methods, you can also add customized Payment Methods to your offer. For instance, for this offer, I would be happy to make a cash deposit at a Rabobank physical branch. I can use the bottom input to add this method to my offer.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 6.png|frameless]]

Once you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

On the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is {{MaxBisqEasyTrade}}.  You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around. 

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 9.png|frameless]]

You also have the option of defining a range instead of a fixed value for the trade amount. By doing that, you set a minimum and maximum amount, and you signal to the market that you are willing to trade any amount between those two numbers. For this example, we will create an offer with a range between 100€ and 200€. Once you have set your fixed value or a range, click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 10.png|frameless]]

With this, you will reach the final step of the offer creation wizard. The final screen shows a summary of all the details you have defined. Now is the time for you to review whether everything is fine. This is important because, once you click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Create offer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, the offer will be available for anyone to take and, once that happens, it will be binding. So, make sure you are happy with the details you see. Once you are sure, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Create offer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and your offer will be added to the market.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 11.png|frameless]]

Your order is finally ready. Now, you will have to wait until another peer takes it. If your offer remains unpicked for longer than you would like to, consider modifying it to add additional payment methods or adding a more flexible range of values that could attract different users.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 12.png|frameless]]

Once a peer takes your offer, you will receive a notification and be able to see the started trade in the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Open Trades&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; panel of Bisq Easy. Also, keep in mind that offers remain open until you close them. If you only want to transact once, you should close it after it gets taken, or more peers could keep taking it!

=== Taking an offer ===

Taking an existing offer is the fastest and simplest way to find a partner and start trading. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and pick an existing offer in it.

Begin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bisq Easy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on the left panel, and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Getting started&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on the top tab. 

[[File:Taking offer to buy 1.png|frameless]]

On this page, click on the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Start trade wizard&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This is the easiest way to get started. A small note: once you become more experienced, you might prefer to use the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Offerbook&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; page to do your trades. But for the first trades, we advise using the trade wizard.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 2.png|frameless]]

With this, you will enter the trade wizard, which will guide you step by step through the process of taking an existing offer to buy some Bitcoin. In the first screen, select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Buy Bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 3.png|frameless]]

In the following screen, you need to indicate which national currency you want to use to pay your trading partner. Since we want to use Euros for this trade, we select that currency in the list. Once you have selected your currency, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 4.png|frameless]]

On the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods you are willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;SEPA&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Revolut&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 5.png|frameless]]

Once you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

On the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq Easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is {{MaxBisqEasyTrade}}.  You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 5.png|frameless]]

For this example, let&amp;#x27;s imagine we would like to buy 150€ worth of Bitcoin. We set the value and click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

In the following screen, you will be presented a list of offers that match your needs. You can select any of the offers presented, but we advise taking the first offer. By default, offers will be presented by decreasing reputation, so the most trusted trades will be on the top of the list. You can check other offers that might have more interesting prices, but be aware that the lower the reputation of the trader, the higher the risk you will face. If you want to keep things safe and simple, simply pick the first offer that you see. Once you have settled for an offer, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 6.png|frameless]]

The final screen will allow you to review all the details. Make sure you are happy with all the details of the trade, since once you move on, you will effectively commit to doing the trade. If there&amp;#x27;s anything you want to change, you can always navigate back and modify any of the trade details. Once you are ready, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Confirm trade&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 7.png|frameless]]

Once you have done this, the offer is taken and you can begin the trade process. You can read more about the trade process here: [[Bisq_Easy#Trade_Process|Trade Process]].

Remember that when you take an offer, you commit to follow through. Be aware that, once you take it, you can&amp;#x27;t simply back down without consequences.

Note that there is also a chance that no offers are found matching your needs. If this is the case, you will see a screen like the one below. You can wait some time and try again later, or you can instead create your own offer. You can read more about creating an offer here [[Bisq_Easy#Bisq_Easy#Creating_an_offer|Creating a buy offer]].

It is expected they will be helpful and supportive to buyers who are new to Bitcoin and/or Bisq. Bisq Easy seller&amp;#x27;s should be passionate about helping new Bisq users smoothly acquire no KYC bitcoin in a peer to peer manner.

* The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.

The traders can agree on an identifier to associate the bank transfer to the trade (e.g. use some random string like &amp;#x27;H3TJAPD&amp;#x27;).
* If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.

== How to stay safe on Bisq Easy ==

Here are some tips for keeping safe when trading on Bisq Easy and avoiding any scams.

=== Tips for bitcoin buyers ===

Bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before sending any bitcoin. For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.

# Start with a small amount as a test trade
# Start chatting with the seller before sending the fiat payment to check that they are still active
# Choose a seller with a high reputation. The higher the reputation of the seller the better. Sellers need a minimum reputation score of 30,000, ideally you should be choosing to trade with someone higher than this. Look at the star system for guidance. It will be safer to trade with a 5 star rated seller than a 1 star rated seller.
# Send payment as soon as possible once you have the seller&amp;#x27;s account details.
# Only send payment to the account details provided by the Seller in the trade chat window. If the seller is trying to change the account they want you to send payment to, it would be better to cancel the trade and open a new trade with another seller. 
# Do not include any references with your payments. For example do send a payment with a reference &amp;#x27;cycle&amp;#x27; or worse &amp;#x27;bitcoin&amp;#x27;. This could cause issues for both the seller and yourself. If a reference is required keep use your account name as the reference. This will allow the seller to know the payment is from yourself and not give any information away other than what they already know.
# Send the payment from the same account you share the information with in trader chat. For example if you are having problems with the payment do not send payment from your partners, business, friends etc account. Instead try and resolve the issue so you can send payment from the correct account and failing that open mediation to get additional support.
# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the seller via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.
# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.

=== Tips for bitcoin sellers ===

Although bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before bitcoin sellers send them any bitcoin, sellers should still be aware of buyers attempting any charge-back scams. There is almost no cost for a bitcoin buyer to create an account and start making trades, therefore, there is little for a buyer to lose by attempting a scam. Almost all buyers on Bisq Easy will be honest but it is still good to be cautious. 

For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.

# Be careful when dealing with buyers with brand new accounts (the buyer&amp;#x27;s account age is shown in their profile).
# Avoid payment methods that have a high possibility of charge-backs eg; PayPal, Venmo
# Make sure the payment you receive matches the buyers account details. Avoid sending bitcoin to buyer&amp;#x27;s with mis-matching account details. It would be better to refund the payment to the account you received the payment from and cancel the trade.
# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the buyer via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.
# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.
# If you have any concerns about a trade open mediation.</text></revision></page><page><title>Bisq Easy</title><ns>0</ns><id>568</id><revision><id>3898</id><timestamp>2025-01-31T01:36:47Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

You can opt for two ways to find a trading partner to get some Bitcoin: taking an existing offer or creating one.

=== Creating an offer ===
Creating an offer is a great way to establish your own terms and simply wait for someone to match what you are after. It is also the right option if you don&amp;#x27;t find any offers with the right premium or payment methods in the market you want to trade in. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and create a new offer in it:

On the following screen, you will be asked for confirmation on which currency you want to pay your Bitcoin with. The selected currency will be the one you selected in the previous &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Offerbook&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; screen. You can change your mind here if needed.

On the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods are you willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;SEPA&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Revolut&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

The minimum trade amount on Bisq easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is {{MaxBisqEasyTrade}}.  You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around. 

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 9.png|frameless]]

You also have the option of defining a range instead of a fixed value for the trade amount. By doing that, you set a minimum and maximum amount, and you signal to the market that you are willing to trade any amount between those two numbers.

On this page, click on the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Start trade wizard&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This is the easiest way to get started. A small note: once you become more experienced, you might prefer to use the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Offerbook&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; page to do your trades. But for the first trades, we advise using the trade wizard.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 2.png|frameless]]

With this, you will enter the trade wizard, which will guide you step by step through the process of taking an existing offer to buy some Bitcoin. In the first screen, select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Buy Bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 3.png|frameless]]

In the following screen, you need to indicate which national currency you want to use to pay your trading partner. Since we want to use Euros for this trade, we select that currency in the list. Once you have selected your currency, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 4.png|frameless]]

On the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods you are willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;SEPA&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Revolut&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Create buy offers screenshot 5.png|frameless]]

Once you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

On the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq Easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is {{MaxBisqEasyTrade}}.  You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 5.png|frameless]]

For this example, let&amp;#x27;s imagine we would like to buy 150€ worth of Bitcoin. We set the value and click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

In the following screen, you will be presented a list of offers that match your needs. You can select any of the offers presented, but we advise taking the first offer. By default, offers will be presented by decreasing reputation, so the most trusted trades will be on the top of the list. You can check other offers that might have more interesting prices, but be aware that the lower the reputation of the trader, the higher the risk you will face. If you want to keep things safe and simple, simply pick the first offer that you see. Once you have settled for an offer, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Next&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to move on.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 6.png|frameless]]

The final screen will allow you to review all the details. Make sure you are happy with all the details of the trade, since once you move on, you will effectively commit to doing the trade. If there&amp;#x27;s anything you want to change, you can always navigate back and modify any of the trade details. Once you are ready, click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Confirm trade&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Taking offer to buy 7.png|frameless]]

Once you have done this, the offer is taken and you can begin the trade process. You can read more about the trade process here: [[Bisq_Easy#Trade_Process|Trade Process]].

Remember that when you take an offer, you commit to follow through. Be aware that, once you take it, you can&amp;#x27;t simply back down without consequences.

Note that there is also a chance that no offers are found matching your needs. If this is the case, you will see a screen like the one below. You can wait some time and try again later, or you can instead create your own offer. You can read more about creating an offer here [[Bisq_Easy#Bisq_Easy#Creating_an_offer|Creating a buy offer]].

== How to sell bitcoin on Bisq Easy ==

Users of Bisq Easy can both make an offer to sell bitcoin, or take an offer from a user looking to buy bitcoin.

Seller&amp;#x27;s on Bisq Easy will usually be experienced Bisq users. It is expected they will be helpful and supportive to buyers who are new to Bitcoin and/or Bisq. Bisq Easy seller&amp;#x27;s should be passionate about helping new Bisq users smoothly acquire no KYC bitcoin in a peer to peer manner. 

As building reputation incurs costs for the bitcoin sellers. It is expected that they will sell bitcoin at a premium of about 10-15%. The premium reflects the additional costs and compensates sellers for the on-boarding service they provide.

== Trade Process ==

Trade process for Bisq Easy is as follows:

* The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker&amp;#x27;s user profile.
* Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.
* The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.
* The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the seller&amp;#x27;s account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.
* Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyer&amp;#x27;s address.
* After the buyer receives the Bitcoin the trade is completed.

== Trade Rules ==

Bisq Easy trading rules are as follows:

* Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.
* After the payment details are exchanged, not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.
* When sending the Fiat the buyer MUST NOT use any term in the &amp;#x27;reason for payment&amp;#x27; field which relates to &amp;#x27;Bisq&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;Bitcoin&amp;#x27;. The traders can agree on an identifier to associate the bank transfer to the trade (e.g. use some random string like &amp;#x27;H3TJAPD&amp;#x27;).
* If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.
* If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the [[Matrix_bisq.chat|Matrix channel]].

== How to stay safe on Bisq Easy ==

Here are some tips for keeping safe when trading on Bisq Easy and avoiding any scams.

=== Tips for bitcoin buyers ===

Bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before sending any bitcoin. For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.

# Start with a small amount as a test trade
# Start chatting with the seller before sending the fiat payment to check that they are still active
# Choose a seller with a high reputation. The higher the reputation of the seller the better. Sellers need a minimum reputation score of 30,000, ideally you should be choosing to trade with someone higher than this. Look at the star system for guidance. It will be safer to trade with a 5 star rated seller than a 1 star rated seller.
# Send payment as soon as possible once you have the seller&amp;#x27;s account details.
# Only send payment to the account details provided by the Seller in the trade chat window. If the seller is trying to change the account they want you to send payment to, it would be better to cancel the trade and open a new trade with another seller. 
# Do not include any references with your payments. For example do send a payment with a reference &amp;#x27;cycle&amp;#x27; or worse &amp;#x27;bitcoin&amp;#x27;. This could cause issues for both the seller and yourself. If a reference is required keep use your account name as the reference. This will allow the seller to know the payment is from yourself and not give any information away other than what they already know.
# Send the payment from the same account you share the information with in trader chat. For example if you are having problems with the payment do not send payment from your partners, business, friends etc account. Instead try and resolve the issue so you can send payment from the correct account and failing that open mediation to get additional support.
# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the seller via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.
# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.

=== Tips for bitcoin sellers ===

Although bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before bitcoin sellers send them any bitcoin, sellers should still be aware of buyers attempting any charge-back scams. There is almost no cost for a bitcoin buyer to create an account and start making trades, therefore, there is little for a buyer to lose by attempting a scam. Almost all buyers on Bisq Easy will be honest but it is still good to be cautious. 

For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.

# Be careful when dealing with buyers with brand new accounts (the buyer&amp;#x27;s account age is shown in their profile).
# Avoid payment methods that have a high possibility of charge-backs eg; PayPal, Venmo
# Make sure the payment you receive matches the buyers account details. Avoid sending bitcoin to buyer&amp;#x27;s with mis-matching account details. It would be better to refund the payment to the account you received the payment from and cancel the trade.
# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the buyer via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.
# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.
# If you have any concerns about a trade open mediation.</text></revision></page><page><title>Trade Protocols</title><ns>0</ns><id>567</id><revision><id>3659</id><timestamp>2024-07-23T15:30:48Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

[[Bisq 2]] will offer users the choice of multiple trade protocols.

A trade protocol serves as the fundamental framework for trading Bitcoin in a secure way. Each trade protocol presents its own set of advantages and trade-offs including:

* Trade fees
* Mining fees
* Security mechanisms
* Dispute mechanisms
* Security deposit requirements 
* Privacy benefits / trade-offs
* Convenience

Bisq 2 offers users the flexibility to select the optimal protocol aligning with their requirements and preferences.

All trade protocols will be able to be accessed from the Bisq 2 application independently. Users will be able to switch between trade protocols for different trades should they wish.

As of now, Bisq Easy stands as the sole implemented protocol, tailored for novice Bitcoin users and suitable for smaller trade amounts.

== Bisq Easy ==

Bisq Easy will be the first trade protocol for Bisq 2. It will be accessible on the launch of Bisq 2. It is an easy to use chat based trade protocol for buying and selling bitcoin for fiat. The security is based on reputation of the sellers.

See here for more information about [[Bisq_Easy|Bisq Easy]].

== Future Trade Protocols ==

Bisq is planning on adding more trade protocols available on Bisq 2. Explore the upcoming trade protocols. Keep an eye out for updates if any of the upcoming protocols catch your interest.

=== Bisq Lightning ===

Escrow based trade protocol on the Lightning network using multi-party computation cryptography.

=== Bisq MuSig===

Bisq 1 currently uses a 2-of-2 multisig as its main trade protocol. This involves the buyer and seller putting down a [[security deposit]] that is locked in a multisig until the trade completes. At some point this protocol will be moved over to Bisq 2.

=== BSQ swaps ===

This allows users to swap from BSQ to BTC and vice versa via atomic swaps, instantaneously and secure.

=== Liquid Swaps ===

Trade any Liquid based assets like USDT and BTC-L with an atomic swap on the Liquid network.

=== Monero Swaps ===

Trade Bitcoin and Monero using an atomic cross chain swap.

=== Liquid MuSig===

This trade protocol will use the same trade protocol as the 2-of-2 multisig but it will replace Bitcoin (BTC) with Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC). The advantage to this is fees will be lower, and users will get more privacy with their trades. The disadvantage is that users will not be trading native bitcoin so will have to be comfortable holding LBTC and consider the costs of converting BTC to LBTC and back again. 

=== Submarine Swaps ===

This trade protocol allows users to swap between Bitcoin on Lightning network to on-chain Bitcoin.

=== Stablecoin Swaps ===

Atomic swaps between Bitcoin and USD stablecoin. Just the same as BSQ swaps, but with a Bitcoin coloured coin built on the same tech.

=== Multisig Options ===

This trade protocol would allow the creation of P2P put and call options with the buyer and seller blocking BTC in a multisig on-chain transaction. 2 PSBT would be created sending the BTC to the buyer or seller depending on the result of a binary event. On expiry a blind oracle would trigger the correct transaction to be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

=== Multisig open contracts===

This trade protocol will allow user defined conditional payments. Any simple contract can be created by locking funds in a multisig 2-of-3 transaction with an arbitrator holding the third key and deciding if the condition was met in case of dispute. This is similar to the old Bisq 1 2-of-3 multisig model, but open to any type of contract than can be easily verified.

== Adding Trade Protocols to Bisq 2 ==

Trade protocols are designed to be modular so more trade protocols can be added in the future. Anyone with ideas for new trade protocols should join the discussion on [[Matrix_bisq.chat|Bisq&amp;#x27;s Matrix chat]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Identity</title><ns>0</ns><id>573</id><revision><id>3528</id><timestamp>2024-03-13T20:10:08Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Bisq 2 users are able to manage multiple identities for their trades.

At Bisq 2 launch in March 2024, the identities

== What are Identities in Bisq 2 ==

Identities in Bisq 2 allow users to create multiple identifies that can be totally independent of each other. Each identity in Bisq 2 has it&amp;#x27;s own unique onion address (this allows for users to receive and broadcast information over the [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor hidden service network]). Each identity will have it&amp;#x27;s own:

* Username (chosen by the user)
* Avatar (chosen by the user)
* Onion address (chosen by the software)
* Profile ID (chosen by the software)

In [[Bisq 1]] to achieve multiple identities a user would have to have multiple Bisq instances. With Bisq 2 multiple identities can be created and used via just the one instance of Bisq 2. This allows for easy switching between profiles and having different types of trades, payment methods, protocols utilized by various profiles. This will give users greater control over their privacy

== What Trade Protocols will use Identities ==

Currently it will just be [[Bisq Easy]] as that is the only available protocol on Bisq 2.

== Building reputation for your Identities ==

Currently it will only be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy that will be interested in building up reputation specific to their identity/s. For more information see: [[reputation]]. 

== Benefits of Identities ==

The benefits of being able to have multiple identities means that a user has greater control over their privacy. 

A user could have:

Profile 1: Used for buying bitcoin
Profile 2: Used for selling bitcoin

OR

Profile 1: Used for buying bitcoin with a personal account
Profile 2: Used for buying bitcoin with a business account
Profile 3: Used for buying bitcoin with a spouses account

OR

Profile 1: Used for selling bitcoin for Euros 
Profile 2: Used for selling bitcoin for British Pounds
Profile 3: Used for selling bitcoin for US Dollars

OR

Profile 1: Used for buying bitcoin on Bisq Easy
Profile 2: Used for atomic swap protocols

Allowing the creation of different multiple identities gives users complete control over what information / data they want to assign to which profile. It is also easy to delete a profile and start a new one at any point.

== Negatives of Identities ==

[[Reputation]] built up overtime for bitcoin sellers on [[Bisq Easy]] is specific to a specific identity. This means that bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will become invested in building up their identities reputation. This is positive for the protocol as a reputation built over time is what gives the protocol it&amp;#x27;s security mechanism, however for seller&amp;#x27;s it means that establishing a new identity will have to be done from scratch.

Although identities give the user a separate; username, avatar, onion address, an profile ID, it does not prevent a user from mistaken linking their identities by associating their fiat accounts with their separate identities. When creating a new identity the user should be aware of what fiat information they are happy to link to each identity.   

== How many identities should you use ==

It is entirely up to the user of Bisq 2 to decide how many profiles they will need. It is expected most users will just create the one profile. However the option is there for users that want to create more for privacy or other reasons.

== Creating an Identity ==

Bisq 2 will prompt you to create an identity when you first run the software. 

To create an additional identity click on &amp;#x27;User options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;User profile&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Create new profile&amp;#x27;

== Switching between Identities ==

It is easy to switch between identifies by clicking on the profile avatar on the top right of Bisq 2 and selecting the profile (identity) desired. When sending messages be sure to check the correct profile is selected. 

== Deleting an Identity ==

You can delete an identity by selecting the identity you want to delete and then clicking on &amp;#x27;User options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;User profile&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;delete profile&amp;#x27;

You cannot delete an identity if you only have one identity.

Be-aware that deleting an identity also deletes any associated reputation it has.</text></revision></page><page><title>Bisq 2 Wallet</title><ns>0</ns><id>574</id><revision><id>3346</id><timestamp>2023-11-11T20:26:59Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

Bisq 1 uses [https://bitcoinj.org/ bitcoinj] for it&amp;#x27;s bitcoin wallet implementation. It is not 100% decided yet which wallet we will use (currently Electrum and Bitcoin core). 

Initially Bisq 2 users will be able to use a bitcoin wallet of their choice for trading on Bisq. Users wanting to utilize BSQ will also need to do so through Bisq 1. 

== Bitcoin wallet ==

For the initial release of Bisq 2 there will be no integrated Bitcoin wallet.

Users will be able to use their own wallet for trading. 

Examples of wallets that can used include:

* [https://bitcoin.org/en/download Bitcoin Core]
* [https://electrum.org/ Electrum]
* [https://sparrowwallet.com/ Sparrow]

For more options see the Bitcoin.org [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet choose your wallet] guide.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Bisq 2 has contributors that take responsibility for specific bonded roles for the network resources and processes. 

There are 2 types of bonded roles.

* [[Bisq_2_Roles#System_roles|System roles]]
* [[Bisq_2_Roles#Delegable_roles|Delegable roles]]

== System roles == 

System roles for Bisq 2 have to be carried out by the authorized contributor. They cannot be delegated to anyone else to maintain security of Bisq.

=== Mediator ===

Bisq 2 mediators help users of the the Bisq Easy trade protocol in Bisq should they encounter any issues during their trades. Mediators have no control over users funds and no enforcement powers. Should a trader in Bisq Easy be behaving poorly (eg trying to scam users) mediators can provide information to moderators to ban users who severely, or repeatedly, violated the trade rules.

=== Moderator ===

Moderators help ensure the smooth running of the Bisq Easy trade protocol in Bisq 2.

Moderators will: 

* Monitor offers to remove spam.
* Deal with reports from users/mediators requesting any violations of Bisq Easy rules. 
* Investigate any cases of violations.
* Ban users profile IDs.
* Flag any messages in violation of the rules.

Users should be aware that as Bisq 2 provides support for multiple identities banning will not have a big effect as banned users can easily create a new profile.

=== Security Manager ===

The Security Manager role is  is similar to the filter operator in Bisq 1. The Security Manager can publish data to block other roles/nodes and other security related things (block trading in the event of a critical incident). However, users will be to deactivate the security manager should they wish.

Another role of the security manager is to broadcast alert messages to the network or to specific users. Alerts can be ignored by the users should they wish.

The types of alters include:

* INFO (info popup with a text message)
* WARN (warn popup with a text message)
* HALT_TRADE (custom emergency popup with a text message and disable all trade operations for the defined trade protocol)
* BAN (no text message, data of the banned role)

=== Update manager ===

The release manager can broadcast a update notification to the network.

The types of notification types include:

* PRE_RELEASE: Send update notification for new pre-release (user can enable to get notified about pre-releases in settings, default is off).
* RELEASE: Send update notification about a new release.
* FORCED_UPDATE: Warn popup with a text message about the need for update to the required min version. All trade operations will be halted until updated.

== Delegable roles == 

Delegable roles can be operated by any users themself and assigned via JVM arguments. They are based on publicly available data and do not require to be in consensus with other Bisq 2 users.

=== Seed node ===

Seed nodes act as providers for the P2P network data and filtered blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain for lite nodes. When a node starts, it requests all P2P network data from several seed nodes. 

There must be at least one hard coded (root) seed node.

=== Oracle node ===

Oracle nodes provide three services. There always has to be at least one oracle node.

==== DAO bridge service ====

The DAO bridge service requests DAO data from a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts the relevant data to the Bisq 2 network. This data is required to verify bonded roles and for reputation sources (Users that have burned BSQ or bonded BSQ).

Users can verify the DAO data provided by the DAO bridge service by requesting the DAO data itself from a Bisq 1 API node and checking if the distributed data was correct. If they would detect invalid data they have to report it to the developers and if it turns out the DAO bridge service has provided incorrect data intentionally a confiscation proposal will be created to request the DAO for confiscating the operators bond.

==== Reputation service ====

The reputation service request data from Bisq 1 via an API for reputation sources (account age and signed account age witness) and broadcasts the relevant data to the Bisq 2 network.

==== Time-stamping service ====

The time-stamping service provides a time-stamping function for profile age of Bisq 2 users.

=== Explorer nodes ===

Explorer nodes are used for requesting the state of a transaction during the trade process. For example they once bitcoin payment is confirmed then they will inform the user.

===Market price node ===

Market price node are used for requesting market prices. For example the BTC/USD or BTC/EUR price. As trades are made based on this information it is important that the market price nodes are bonded.

== How does someone get to perform a bonded role in Bisq 2 ==

Contributors for the roles are usually have established Bisq contributors that have been approved by a DAO vote to perform a certain role.

For increased security a contributor must make a proposal to become a contributor for a specific role that is voted on by the Bisq DAO. If the vote is successful that a BSQ bond will be locked up automatically for that contributors specific role.

The process for performing a role in Bisq 2 is usually as follows:

# A potential contributor posts a proposal to [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository] putting their case forward for performing a certain role for Bisq.
# The proposal is discussed on the GitHub issue.
# Once there is rough consensus for the proposal to be accepted the potential contributor then makes a proposal for a bonded roles from the Bisq application. They would need to ensure that they have enough BSQ available for the BSQ bond.
# The proposal is put to the Bisq DAO for voting. If the proposal is accepted the BSQ bond is locked, the role will be registered in the UI, and then the user can then work in their new role. If the proposal is rejected the BSQ is returned to the user that made the proposal.

For more information on becoming a contributor for Bisq see the [[Contributor_checklist|Contributor Checklist]].

Not all roles require bonding so it is often easier to get started on a non-bonded role and develop your reputation prior to contributing for a role that requires bonding.

== BSQ bonding for roles/nodes ==

All roles/nodes require a BSQ bond and DAO voting.

The oracle node verifies that all Bisq 2 bonded roles/nodes have a BSQ bond setup.

Their are 2 nodes that cannot be verified by the oracle node. These are the root seed node and the root oracle node (as this would present a chicken and egg problem).

Both these root nodes however are required to have also their own BSQ bond set up.

The bonding process is transparent all users are able to manually verify that all bonded roles / nodes have valid BSQ bonds. This is can be done though the DAO section of the Bisq 1 application.

== Confiscation of BSQ bonding for roles/nodes ==

If a role/node is behaving in a way that is harmful to users then anyone can make a request for the bond for that role/node to be confiscated.

The process would be as follows:

# A user posts a proposal explaining why they think a bond should be confiscated on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository].
# The proposal is discussed on the GitHub issue. This is also give the bond holder the opportunity to respond.
# Once there is rough consensus for confiscation to be accepted the user requesting the confiscation then makes a proposal to confiscate the bond in the Bisq 1 application.
# The proposal is put to the Bisq DAO for voting. If the proposal is accepted the BSQ bond is burnt, the role will be un-registered in the UI, and then the contributor of the role/node will lose their bond and cease performing that bonded role for Bisq. If the proposal is rejected their would be no changes. 

Confiscating a bond is a harsh penalty which should not be taken lightly. Therefore, the Bisq DAO makes confiscation proposals especially hard to approve: they require a quorum of at least 200,000 BSQ and 85% acceptance to pass (instead of the typical &gt;50%).

In this way, the risk that people in high-trust roles misbehave is minimized, and the community has access to a responsible mechanism for handling such a scenario in cases that warrant it. 

For more information see [[Introduction_to_the_DAO#Ensure_honesty_in_high-trust_roles|Ensuring honesty in high-trust roles]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Introduction</title><ns>0</ns><id>166</id><revision><id>2337</id><timestamp>2021-08-24T03:14:47Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

Bisq is a decentralized bitcoin exchange network best understood in terms of its major components:

# Bisq is a cross-platform &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;desktop application&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies.
# Bisq is a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;trading protocol&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that enables individuals to exchange directly with one another over the internet, eliminating the need for trusted third party exchange services.
# Bisq is the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;peer-to-peer network&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; formed by Bisq applications discovering, connecting to, and working with one another to implement the Bisq trading protocol. The Bisq network is fully peer-to-peer in that it requires no centrally-controlled servers and has no single points of failure.

Bisq is not a company—it is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;free/libre software&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; released under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. Bisq is built by individuals around the world who choose to work together. Bisq is used by individuals around the world who choose to trade with Bisq instead of other bitcoin exchanges. 

The project itself is organized as a [[decentralized autonomous organization]].

== Why Bisq exists ==

Bisq’s mission is to provide a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;secure&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;private&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;censorship-resistant&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; way of exchanging bitcoin for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies over the internet.

When we say secure, we are referring to the safety of users&amp;#x27; funds. Centralized exchanges require users to store their bitcoins—​for at least some amount of time—​on exchange servers. When thousands of users do this, it creates extreme incentives for those servers to be hacked and for those users&amp;#x27; bitcoins to be stolen. And time and time again these hacks and thefts are exactly what happen.

When we say private, we are referring to users&amp;#x27; ability to control access to their own information. Most centralized exchanges require users to divulge personally identifying information in order to set up an account, which in turn links users&amp;#x27; trading activity to their respective identities. This practice creates extreme risks for users: their personal details and financial information will be stolen, leaked, or otherwise used against their own best interests.

When we say censorship-resistant, we are referring to freedom: users&amp;#x27; ability to voluntarily trade with one another without interference from a third party. Centralized bitcoin exchanges are highly susceptible to such interference. By their nature, they must operate within one legal jurisdiction or another, putting them at risk of being fined or shut down if they do not comply with the laws and other rules of that jurisdiction, which may include restrictions on who can trade and what can be traded, and which almost always include requirements to collect personal information as described above.

Bisq was built to fulfill this mission: provide people an exchange mechanism where users keep control of funds, that is private by default, and that defends freedom of transaction.

{{Admonition_Note|If Bitcoin’s motto is &amp;quot;be your own bank,&amp;quot; Bisq’s motto is &amp;quot;be your own exchange.&amp;quot;}}

== How Bisq works == 

=== In a nutshell ===

Imagine you want to buy bitcoin (BTC) in exchange for Euros (EUR). In Bisq terminology, you are a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buyer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of BTC looking for a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;seller&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of BTC who will accept EUR as payment. 

To complete a trade on Bisq, you would follow a series of steps similar to these:

# You download and run the Bisq application on your laptop or desktop computer
# You configure Bisq with your EUR payment method details (bank transfer, money order, etc)
# You browse Bisq’s offer book for existing offers to sell BTC for EUR
# You take an existing offer, agreeing to buy the seller’s BTC for your EUR
# You send EUR by the agreed-upon method and indicate you have done so in Bisq
# You and the seller wait for your EUR payment to arrive
# The seller receives your EUR and confirms payment receipt in Bisq
# You receive your bitcoin from the seller and the trade is complete

For complete instructions on each of the steps above, see [https://bisq.network/getting-started/ Getting Started].

These steps can vary in a number of ways depending on whether you wish to buy or sell bitcoin, whether you are the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;maker&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;taker&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of an offer, and which payment methods you prefer to use.

Regardless, the steps above are quite different from those one would follow to complete a similar trade on a centralized exchange.

=== How trading with Bisq is different ===

Bisq is a desktop application and not a browser-based web application. Experienced traders will notice is that there is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;no automatic order matching&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on the Bisq exchange. Instead, Bisq users manually search for and select specific offers they wish to take directly from other Bisq users. This approach enables truly peer-to-peer trade settlement, and ensures that users are in control of which counterparties they trade with.

Bisq is also unique among decentralized bitcoin exchanges in the way it coordinates &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;out-of-band fiat payments&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Bisq does not directly integrate with banks or other national currency payment systems in any way. Rather, Bisq’s trading protocol orchestrates the process of buyer and seller working together to settle fiat payments outside of the Bisq application, as demonstrated in steps 5-7 of the trading example above.

These and other differences result in a key trade-off for Bisq users: trade settlement can take longer, but transactions are far more secure, private and censorship-resistant.

=== How Bisq keeps funds secure ===
* Bisq is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;entirely non-custodial&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: users stay in control of fiat and cryptocurrency funds
* Trades include &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;[[security deposit|security deposits]]&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; from buyer and seller to prevent fraud
* The bitcoin for sale and bitcoin security deposits are locked in a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;2-of-2 multisig escrow&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;
* Disputes are handled through a decentralized human &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;[[dispute resolution]]&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; system

=== How Bisq keeps data private ===
* Using Bisq requires &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;no registration or centralized identity verification&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;
* Every Bisq application is a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Tor hidden service&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;
* Bisq has no &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;central servers or databases&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to record data
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Data is encrypted&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; such that trade details are readable only by counterparties

=== How Bisq resists censorship ===
* Bisq’s network is a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;fully distributed P2P network&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, and thus difficult to shut down
* Bisq’s network is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;built on top of Tor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, and thus inherits Tor’s own censorship resistance
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bisq is code&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, not a company; it is not incorporated, and thus cannot be disincorporated</text></revision></page><page><title>Downloading and installing</title><ns>0</ns><id>69</id><revision><id>3881</id><timestamp>2025-01-28T08:45:20Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

To use Bisq, you must first &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;[https://bisq.network/downloads/ download and install]&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; it. Most exchanges are centralized exchanges running on servers controlled by the exchange. Bisq is decentralized, running only on the desktops of Bisq users.

Bisq manages offers to trade using a peer-to-peer network. This is a global network made of users who are also running Bisq on their own computers.

Centralized services are easy to monitor, block, and shut down, while peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, Bitcoin and Bisq are difficult to surveil, censor, shut down or hack.

All of this means that if you want to use the Bisq network, you must download and run the software on your own machine.

== Download Bisq ==

The most convenient way to install Bisq on your machine is from a pre-built install file from the [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Bisq website] or [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest latest GitHub release].

There&amp;#x27;s also a community-maintained [https://snapcraft.io/bisq-desktop Snap package] for various Linux distributions.

{{Admonition_Note|See [[#OS-specific_install_notes|install notes for various Linux distributions below]].}}

You can download the installer for your operating system and install Bisq right away, but we strongly recommend that you [[ #Verify installer file | verify the integrity ]] of your installer file first.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;If you have issues, please check the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Known issues with installation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; section in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest release notes].&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

== Verify installer file ==

=== Bisq2 specific instructions ===

Bisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.

Usually, installation binaries are signed by Alejandro García (key ID: E222AA02, primary release manager). However, since this key has expired — and the expired key was included in previous versions of the Bisq2 app — the in-app verification process would fail when attempting to download version 2.1.2. To prevent this issue, the secondary release manager assumed responsibility for signing that release. The signingkey.asc file specifies the key used for signing the binaries.

HenrikJannsen&amp;#x27;s signing key can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc here] (full fingerprint: B8A5 D214 ADFA A387 A14C  8BCF 02AA 2BAE 387C 8307).

To import the key in Linux and MacOS:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc | gpg --import &lt;/nowiki&gt;

GPG will return &amp;quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&amp;quot;, this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)

To verify the installer against the signature:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Replace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.

In Windows. you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].

Any software that manages funds, signs transactions, and deals with highly sensitive data is a prime target for malware. Bisq does all three. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you verify the integrity of the installer file you use to install Bisq.

This verification is something that you should do for the initial Bisq install. After the initial install, you will be prompted to install updates through Bisq&amp;#x27;s interface. The Bisq software will verify the integrity of updates for you.

Bisq installer files are currently built and signed by Alejandro Garcia (alejandrogarcia83). His public key ID is &lt;code&gt;E222AA02&lt;/code&gt; and fingerprint is &lt;code&gt;B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02&lt;/code&gt;, which you can verify through [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/commits?author=alejandrogarcia83 commits on GitHub].

The full public key is available [https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc here on the Bisq website].

= Bisq 1: Obtain signature files for installer files =

All Bisq releases are cryptographically signed by its maintainer. Users can ensure that nobody tampered with the release by verifying its signatures. It’s recommended to download the GPG key from an independent keyserver (such as [https://keys.openpgp.org/ keys.openpgp.org] or [https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ keyserver.ubuntu.com] to ensure that no adversary replaced the GPG keys and signatures on the release server.

Bisq 1 releases are signed either by Alejandro García (alejandrogarcia83) or Gabriel Bernard (gabernard). Here are the public key ids and fingerprints of both keys:

Alejandro García (public key id &lt;code&gt;0xF806F422E222AA02&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;code&gt;B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02&lt;/code&gt; Gabriel Bernard (public key id &lt;code&gt;0x6C8D14D84A133008&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;code&gt;1655 3BA9 2694 95EE 53BB  A33A 6C8D 14D8 4A13 3008&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;windows&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Windows ==

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;download-and-install-gpg4win&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Download and install Gpg4win ===

Windows does not come with GPG software installed by default, so you will need to install it in order to verify Bisq’s installer files. You can get Gpg4win [https://www.gpg4win.org/ here]. Double-click the installer file and proceed to install with all default settings.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;import-alejandro-garcías-key&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Import Alejandro García’s key ===

Open Kleopatra (part of Gpg4win) and click on “Lookup on Server”. 

[[File:Image_1.cleaned.png]]

Next type into the search field &lt;code&gt;alejandro.garcia@disroot.org&lt;/code&gt; and press on search. You’ll see the following output:

[[File:Image 2.cleaned.png]]

Press on “Details…” to see the key’s fingerprint and confirm that it is correct.

[[File:Image 3.cleaned.png]]

After verifying that the fingerprint is correct, press on “Close” and press on “Import” to import the key.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;verify-the-signature-of-the-binary-you-downloaded&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Verify the signature of the binary you downloaded ===

With the &lt;code&gt;install-file.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;signature-file.exe.asc&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory, double-click on the &lt;code&gt;.exe.asc&lt;/code&gt; file.

You should see a Kleopatra window pop up with a green progress bar that says “Verified .exe with .exe.asc”. The program will continue to say “The data could not be verified” in bold but you can disregard that message.

This means the installer file we downloaded is intact and as intended. You can proceed to install Bisq by double-clicking the .exe file.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;mac-and-linux&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Mac and Linux ==

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;import-alejandro-garcías-key-1&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Import Alejandro García’s key ===

To import Alejandro García’s open a terminal and run:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --receive-keys 0xF806F422E222AA02&lt;/pre&gt;
Next you need to verify key’s fingerprint and tell GPG to trust the key. First run:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --edit-key 0xF806F422E222AA02&lt;/pre&gt;
Then type:

&lt;pre&gt;fpr&lt;/pre&gt;
Now ensure that you see the same output as here:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg&amp;amp;gt; fpr
pub   rsa4096/0xF806F422E222AA02 2022-09-28 Alejandro García &amp;amp;lt;alejandro.garcia@disroot.org&amp;amp;gt;
 Primary key fingerprint: B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02&lt;/pre&gt;
If the fingerprint matches you can trust the key. To trust the key type:

&lt;pre&gt;trust&lt;/pre&gt;
Now you’ll see following output:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg&amp;amp;gt; trust
pub  rsa4096/0xF806F422E222AA02
     created: 2022-09-28  expires: 2026-10-03  usage: SC  
     trust: unknown       validity: unknown

     created: 2022-09-28  expires: 2026-10-03  usage: E   
[ unknown] (1). Alejandro García &amp;amp;lt;alejandro.garcia@disroot.org&amp;amp;gt;

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users&amp;#x27; keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don&amp;#x27;t know or won&amp;#x27;t say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision?&lt;/pre&gt;
Type &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; to trust to the key and you’ll see following output:

&lt;pre&gt;Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) &lt;/pre&gt;
Now type &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to confirm. Now you can quit by typing &lt;code&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;verify-the-signature-of-the-binary-you-downloaded-1&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Verify the signature of the binary you downloaded ===

With the installer file and installer signature file in the same directory, run:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --verify INSTALLER.asc INSTALLER&lt;/pre&gt;
Where &lt;code&gt;INSTALLER.asc&lt;/code&gt; is the filename of the &lt;code&gt;.asc&lt;/code&gt; file you just downloaded.

You should see an output similar to this:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg: Signature made Fri 22 Nov 2024 07:42:50 PM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key B493319106CC3D1F252E19CBF806F422E222AA02

== Build from source ==

[https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/build.md Building Bisq from source] requires only a single command once you have the correct JDK installed on your machine. 

Finding and installing the correct JDK can sometimes be frustrating, so Bisq&amp;#x27;s developers have written scripts to make it easier:
* [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/scripts/install_java.sh For Linux and macOS]
* [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/scripts/install_java.bat For Windows]

== OS-specific install notes ==

=== macOS ===

Starting with version v1.9.6, we remove notarization from our build pipeline because of of the risk of Apple certification revocation (see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions/6341). Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS.

You will receive an error popup saying that Bisq &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;is damaged and can&amp;#x27;t be opened. You should move it to the Trash&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Please follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

If you are running already macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to do following to be able to start Bisq:
* enter following command in Apple Terminal &lt;code&gt;sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq.app&lt;/code&gt;
* hit enter and you will be prompted to enter your password to be able to execute the command as super user

After running this successfully you should be able to start Bisq as always.

If this procedure still does not allow you to install Bisq, a last resort workaround is to install Bisq in a Linux Virtual Machine running on your system.

=== Windows ===

Starting with version v1.9.6, we remove the developer code signing because of the same reason as with Apple.

For Windows you just have to ignore the warning after you have verified the installation file yourself and proceed with the installation.

=== Linux (General) ===

Bisq works with a number of Linux distros, but not all desktop environments are supported. 

These are all known compatible desktop environments. This is a growing list. If you find another compatible desktop, please inform us so it can be added.

* GNOME
* Mate
* Xfce
* KDE Plasma
* Cinnamon

Bisq might not work properly if you switch from the original desktop environment of your Linux distribution to a different one.

Note: users with discrete GPUs may encounter issues launching Bisq in some desktop environments.

=== Arch Linux ===

The Bisq [https://bisq.network/downloads/ downloads page] includes a link to the Arch User Repository (AUR) page for the [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bisq/ bisq package].

# From the command line, clone the repository from AUR. 
# Then from the cloned directory, run &lt;code&gt;makepkg -si&lt;/code&gt;. This will read the PKGBUILD file to download, verify, build, and install the various tools necessary to install Bisq.

If the version found on AUR is not up to date, you can read [[Fix_Arch_release]].

Please be advised: when you&amp;#x27;re using AUR, you&amp;#x27;re responsible for your own safety. Be sure to verify the PKGBUILD file.

=== Gentoo ===

Use &lt;code&gt;eselect repository enable booboo&lt;/code&gt; to use the &amp;#x27;booboo&amp;#x27; overlay which carries the binaries, and then emerge &lt;code&gt;bisq&lt;/code&gt;

=== Tails ===

Please see [[Running Bisq on Tails]] for details on downloading, installing, and configuring Bisq on Tails.

=== Qubes ===

Please see [[Running Bisq on Qubes]] for a detailed Qubes setup guide.

== Update Bisq ==

Installing a new Bisq version will update Bisq. More details at [[Updating Bisq]].

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

It is critical that you &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;back up your wallet seed&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The Bisq wallet is totally controlled by you, and you only—wallets are created and stored by the Bisq software right on your machine.

For this reason, you should keep your Bisq wallet&amp;#x27;s seed words safe and [[Encrypting_your_wallet|encrypt your Bisq wallet]] as well. There are no other copies of this data, so you&amp;#x27;re on your own if you lose them.

__TOC__

== Write down your seed words ==

With your wallet seed words and date, you can recover your Bisq wallet and funds if the wallet is ever lost, destroyed, or corrupted. 

{{Wallet_date_explainer}}

You can find your wallet&amp;#x27;s seed words in &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Wallet seed&lt;/code&gt;. If you&amp;#x27;ve encrypted your wallet, you&amp;#x27;ll need to enter the password before you can see your seed words.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;actually&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; write down your seed words and date with a pen and paper.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Saving them on your computer, even if you do so in a secure password manager, makes it possible for a hacker to obtain them through sneaky schemes like keylogging. Going low-tech with pen and paper eliminates all such digital attack vectors. 

[[File:Find-wallet-seed-words.png|thumb|left|600px|Location of wallet seed words and date.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== What seed words do and don&amp;#x27;t do ==

Backing up a Bisq wallet&amp;#x27;s seed words only ensures that you will always have access to the funds stored in that Bisq wallet. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;All other Bisq data must be backed up separately.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Keys used for signing P2P messages (trade-related messages such as acknowledging payment sending/receiving, trader chat, dispute resolution, etc), Tor keys, payment account details, and more must be backed up separately.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Backing up&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; your Bisq data is crucial to ensure you can retain control over trades, disputes, payment accounts, and funds in case of issues with your machine (e.g., drive failure) or Bisq itself (e.g., critical bugs).

All Bisq data is stored right on your computer—it&amp;#x27;s never stored (or even sent) to a central server, so backing it up is your job.

To see how to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;restore&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; data to Bisq, see [[Restoring application data]].

__TOC__

= Back up the entire Bisq data directory =

The safest, quickest, easiest, and most comprehensive thing you can do to safeguard your data is to back up the whole data directory at regular intervals. See the various elements of the data directory detailed [[Data_directory#Data_Directory_Structure|here]].

In addition, to make restoring payment accounts easier, you may want to back up an [[#Back_up_payment_accounts|export of your payment accounts]].

== While Bisq is running ==

Go to &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Backup&lt;/code&gt; and put in a location for your backup to be exported to (note that this section is titled &amp;quot;Backup wallet&amp;quot; in the software but it actually exports the entire data directory).

[[File:Backup-while-running.png|600px|thumb|left|Data directory backup screen.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== While Bisq is closed  ==

When Bisq is closed, you can simply copy the entire data directory and paste it somewhere safe. Find the location of your data directory by clicking on the &lt;code&gt;Open Directory&lt;/code&gt; button (see screenshot above) or see [[Data_directory#Default_Locations|data directory locations here]].

== Encrypt your backup ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Backup files are not encrypted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you’ve set a wallet password, your wallet files will be encrypted, but all your other data will &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; be encrypted. 

We recommend encrypting the whole backup folder with something like gpg, 7-Zip, Cryptomator, etc.

= Back up payment accounts =

If you just want to back up your payment accounts, export them from &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;.

Be advised: exporting your accounts this way only exports metadata. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Aging and signing status are not included&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. To include [[Account_limits|account aging and signing status]], you also need to save the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key&lt;/code&gt; file from your [[Data_directory|data directory]].

Because of the way [[Restoring_application_data#Restore_payment_accounts|restoring payment accounts]] works, it&amp;#x27;s best for most users to back up the whole data directory &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; back up a payment account export.

[[File:Export-payment-accounts.png|600px|thumb|left|Export fiat payment accounts here. You can export altcoin accounts from the Altcoin Accounts tab.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

= Back up your wallet seed =

Please be sure to [[Backing_up_your_wallet_seed|properly back up your wallet seed]].

= Export Tor state =

If you want to carry over a particular onion address (and keep your local reputation), you can replace the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservice&lt;/code&gt; folder in your data directory with the one from your backup.

= Export trade history =

In &lt;code&gt;Portfolio&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;History&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;#x27;ll find an &lt;code&gt;Export to CSV&lt;/code&gt; button to export your trade history.

There&amp;#x27;s no way to import this data back into Bisq, but it can be useful to have a copy of this data for yourself for record-keeping, analysis, etc.

= Export transaction history =

In &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Transactions&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;#x27;ll find an &lt;code&gt;Export to CSV&lt;/code&gt; button to export your trade history.

There&amp;#x27;s no way to import this data back into Bisq, but it can be useful to have a copy of this data for yourself for record-keeping, analysis, etc.</text></revision></page><page><title>Payment methods</title><ns>0</ns><id>133</id><revision><id>3851</id><timestamp>2025-01-24T17:05:09Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:1--&gt;
Bisq offers several &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;payment methods&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

&lt;!--T:2--&gt;
Every offer on Bisq designates a payment method for traders to settle payments. The Bisq software does not actually integrate with any payment methods—&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;all non-bitcoin fund transfers are made outside of Bisq software&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

&lt;!--T:3--&gt;
Unlike cryptocurrency transfers, many fiat payment transfers are riddled with flaws and limitations that require Bisq to employ special measures to encourage fair and honest trades. One of these measures is lower per-trade limits, which are covered below. Another key measure is [[Account_limits#Account_signing|account signing]].

&lt;!--T:7--&gt;
__TOC__

== Fiat payment methods == &lt;!--T:8--&gt;

&lt;!--T:9--&gt;
The payment methods vary in chargeback risk, regional availability, transaction size, fees, privacy, verifiability, and other characteristics.
The top consideration for maintaining payment methods is chargeback risk. PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App are not supported on Bisq because chargebacks for payments made with those services are relatively easy.

&lt;!--T:10--&gt;
We welcome suggestions for new payment methods on Bisq, especially for those that enable new markets. Documentation on the criteria and process for adding new payment methods is found [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=re%3Apayment-method&amp;amp;template=add_payment_method.md&amp;amp;title= here]. Please also feel free to make suggestions by reaching out on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] in the #payment-methods channel.

&lt;!--T:11--&gt;
Below is a list of fiat payment methods Bisq currently supports.

&lt;!--T:12--&gt;
&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Note: The maximum trade sizes listed below are not available for most newly-created payment accounts. Please refer to [https://bisq.wiki/Account_signing Account signing] for details on how to enable larger trade sizes for your payment accounts. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Trading fees&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are paid to fund the [[DAO | Bisq DAO]] when making or taking an offer. Fees can be paid in BSQ or BTC. 

__TOC__

== Getting a discount ==

Bisq encourages traders to use [[BSQ]] by offering a discount of approximately 50%. This discount fluctuates as the BSQ/BTC rate fluctuates. To maintain the 50% discount target, trading fees are [[update BSQ trading fees | updated]] every cycle as necessary.

{{Admonition_Note|If you&amp;#x27;re interested in using BSQ to pay trading fees, [[Paying_trading_fees_with_BSQ#Acquire_BSQ|see this article for instructions]].}}

== Current rates ==

Combined BTC trading fee rate is 1.3% (0.15% by maker and 1.15% by taker). Absolute minimum fee to avoid dust is 0.00005 BTC.

Combined BSQ trading fee rate is targeted at 0.65% (0.075% by maker and 0.575% by taker). Absolute minimum fee to avoid dust is 0.03 BSQ.

Trading fee rates and absolute minimums are DAO parameters that [[Proposals|must be proposed]] and approved through DAO voting in order to take effect. BTC fee rates tend to stay constant, but BSQ rates are [[Updating_BSQ_trading_fees|adjusted every cycle]] to account for BSQ rate fluctuation.

== Selecting how to pay ==

Traders choose how they&amp;#x27;d prefer to pay trading fees while making or taking an offer. BSQ and BTC amounts (and fiat equivalents) are shown.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

It is best practice that any Bitcoin user installs his own node, to send and verify his own transactions; moreover, if you use Bisq consistently, you are strongly encouraged to do so, as it will make the bitcoin network connection much more stable, and especially reduce the risk of needing [[Resyncing_SPV_file|SPV resync]] on a wallet that contains many transactions. Even when a SPV resync is needed, it will be much painless if done while connected to your own node.

__TOC__

= Hardware requirements =

The most demanding part of a full Bitcoin node is disk space: 1TB is considered the bare minimum (2TB is better for future proofing your node), and a SSD is recommended, as the constant write operations would risk damaging the average mechanical disk. There are pruned nodes that will only keep the very last blocks of the blockchain in order to save on disk space, but as Bisq needs a fully verifying node, we will only be examining this case in the present guide.

The following are viable hardware options to host the node:
* refurbished laptop with at least 8GB of RAM
** pros: comes with display, keyboard, and basic storage (existing storage will need to be replaced or expanded), can run multiple services and act as a full fledged home server, has builtin UPS
** cons: drains more power and is more expensive than a Raspberry Pi 3, takes up more space on your shelf
* dedicated Raspberry Pi 3
** pros: very small, low power, completely silent
** cons: no builtin display, keyboard nor storage, very low performance, needs more initial maintenance
* your daily driver machine
** pros: no need to source additional hardware (except the additional storage if it&amp;#x27;s not enough), will likely not suffer from the limited additional overhead of a Bitcoin node while you use it normally
** cons: you either have to leave it always running, to keep updated with blocks as soon as they are mined, or will have to wait a variable amount of time for it to catch up to the current block height each time you turn it on, before you can use Bisq

= Installing the software =

When installing the Bitcoin node software, you will be either working on a graphical user interface, or on a system that only operates via command line (most likely the Raspberry).

== Systems with graphical interface ==

Unless you want to install a leaner daemon setup and follow the command-line steps below, installing directly on a graphical interface is the easier path, as you can download and verify the files as per the instructions on https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ and then install the software as you normally would on your operating system, making sure you point it to the 1TB drive to save the blockchain.

== Systems with command line interface ==

You may choose to run a dedicated refurbished laptop on Linux and without a desktop environment, and it would be a wise choice; regarding a Raspberry, while you could install a graphical desktop environment on a Pi 3, it is absolutely not recommended to do so, because it will be a self-contained system that will only cater to the task of running the node software, and any additional load, like keeping the graphical interface in memory, will degrade its performance.

There is a well known step-by-step guide that will illustrate how to install a full Bitcoin Node on a Raspberry, called the [https://raspibolt.org/ RaspiBolt Guide], plus its amd64/desktop counterpart, directed at laptops/PCs, called [https://minibolt.info MiniBolt]. They both include a section dedicated to installing software for a Lightning Network node, but you will only need to follow the guide for your system up to the configuration of the Bitcoin client.

== Caveats ==

There have been multiple reports about the Ronin node package not allowing Bisq to connect (after the first time), and we know no tested solution for this issue, so it is recommended using the steps above to obtain the Bitcoin node software.

== Common steps ==

No matter the path you chose above, you will have to wait a considerable amount of time after installing the node.

The initial block download will have your Bitcoin client fetch from the p2p network, and verify one by one, all the blocks since the genesis, which at the time of writing amounts to 570GB of data, so expect from 2 to 10 days of uninterrupted CPU and network activity, depending on the connection (whether clearnet or Tor) and the performance of the hardware (a faster machine will complete the block verification and writing to disk in less time)

= Setup the node to accept connections from Bisq =

For the bitcoin connection on Bisq to be effective, you will need to make sure the node&amp;#x27;s configuration is correct.
If you installed the client via command line interface following the guides linked above, you will probably have a working config file already, but in case you installed the GUI client, you will have to manually edit the &lt;code&gt;bitcoin.conf&lt;/code&gt; file from within the settings, and make sure it contains the following:

&lt;code&gt;server=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;prune=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;peerbloomfilters=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

which in turn:
* enable the block server mode
* disable the pruning of old blocks
* allow Bisq to run SPV queries on the node

If the node is running on a separate machine, but on the same local network, it needs to listen for connections from external clients as well, and the easiest way of doing this is to add the following to the config file:

&lt;code&gt;bind=0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;

No need for the above if the node runs on a different network, and you will connect to it via Tor.

After any change to the &lt;code&gt;bitcoin.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, the bitcoin client needs to be restarted.

If, on the same remote machine running the node, you installed &lt;code&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; as the Bolt guides suggest, you have to allow incoming connections on port 8333 (edit the local network base address as needed):

&lt;code&gt;sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/24 to any port 8333 comment &amp;#x27;Bitcoin p2p&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt;

= Setup the connection from Bisq to the node =

The following will change depending on where the node is located respectively to Bisq.

== Connecting to a node on the same PC ==

If the Bitcoin node is installed on the same machine as Bisq, the latter will automatically connect to it without the need to edit anything. Considering how Bisq will only run on amd64 architecture, you can achieve this with either your daily driver, or a dedicated laptop/desktop through direct or remote access (for example via [[Remote_control_via_web_browser_using_xpra|xpra]]).

Make sure no other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) are running while starting Bisq.

== Connecting to a Bitcoin node on the same local network ==

After setting the config file to accept connections from external machines, as explained above, you will have to setup Bisq to connect to the remote node. This should be achieved by launching Bisq with the following command-line parameters (as an example, the node on the local network is at 10.0.0.21, edit the command to match your situation):

&lt;code&gt;Bisq -btcNodes=10.0.0.21:8333 -useTorForBtc=false&lt;/code&gt;

Once Bisq has started, you should verify under Settings &gt; Network, that these settings are replicated, in particular you should see that the node&amp;#x27;s IP:port is filled in the address field, and the &amp;quot;Use Tor for Bitcoin Network&amp;quot; checkbox is disabled.

== Connecting to a remote node through the Tor Network ==

If you installed the node software on a machine that is geographically separate from your local network, and you followed the Bolt guides, it will be already connecting to the internet through Tor, so you can point Bisq to its onion address.

On the node&amp;#x27;s machine&amp;#x27;s shell, run

&lt;code&gt;bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion&lt;/code&gt;

to obtain your onion address, copy it to the clipboard and paste it in Bisq under Settings &gt; Network &gt; Use Custom Bitcoin Core nodes 

Bisq will offer to restart, thus connecting to the custom remote node.

= Verify the connection =

Once you connect to your own node, Bisq will show &lt;code&gt;Bitcoin network peers: 1&lt;/code&gt; in the bottom right corner, and under Settings &gt; Network you will notice the node is the only one listed under &amp;quot;Bitcoin network&amp;quot;.

= Troubleshooting =

If you get into a state where Bisq is unable to connect, you can revert to a provided node as follows.  

For MacOS:
 &lt;code&gt;Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;
 
For Linux:

 &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;

For Windows:

 &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\your-username-here\AppData\Local\Bisq\Bisq.exe -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Bisq is designed and tested to work well on most user environments. This includes all major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows), as well as some more exotic ones ([[Running_Bisq_on_Qubes|Qubes]], [[Running_Bisq_on_Tails|Tails]]).

However, in certain setups and in certain situations, Bisq may be slower than usual.

If that is the case for you, here are a few performance tips for you to consider.

== General Tips ==

* Use the latest Bisq version
* Expect a somewhat slower UI immediately upon opening Bisq, as long as Bisq is &amp;quot;Synchronizing DAO&amp;quot;
** You can check if &amp;quot;Synchronizing DAO&amp;quot; is running in the bottom bar of the UI. If it is running, it will be shown as a progress bar.
** Depending on the user&amp;#x27;s environment and hardware setup, this process &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;may&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; be resource intensive (high CPU usage, sluggish UI)
** After this process is complete, Bisq should be faster and more responsive

== macOS-specific Tips ==

Avoid minimizing the Bisq app. In certain situations, macOS may try to allocate less resources to it (CPU, RAM), de-prioritize its threads, de-prioritize or interrupt open network connections, or attempt other optimizations to free up system resources.</text></revision></page><page><title>Decentralized autonomous organization</title><ns>0</ns><id>227</id><revision><id>2211</id><timestamp>2021-04-28T00:00:37Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The Bisq network is organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s purpose is to make the Bisq&amp;#x27;s governance model as decentralized and censorship-resistant as the Bisq network itself.

The Bisq founders realized that decentralized software—no matter how technically robust—is no good if it’s still controlled by a single entity. All the software’s technical strength would be worthless if the whole project could be ruined by attacking the single entity that runs it.

Thus the need for decentralizing the resources in charge of running Bisq itself. These resources cannot be organized in the form of a company, a nonprofit, or any other traditional organization because a single entity would be a single point of failure. But what to do? How can a project do anything useful without becoming an organization with some kind of structure? How can strategy be determined? How can resources be allocated? How can work get done? How can revenue be earned, and how can it be distributed?

The Bisq project needed infrastructure to provide these functions, and the Bisq DAO is its solution.

{{Admonition_Note|You do not have to participate in any aspect of the DAO or BSQ to use Bisq, but you may find it interesting. It&amp;#x27;s built entirely on Bitcoin and been operating since early 2019 without major issue.

If you decide to proceed and start contributing, you&amp;#x27;ll want to join Bisq&amp;#x27;s GitHub organization so you can be assigned to issues:

# Request an invite to the [https://github.com/bisq-network @bisq-network GitHub organization] on Matrix. An admin will get you set up. Doing this makes it possible to add you to the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams @bisq-network/contributors] team and to assign you to GitHub issues.
# After accepting your GitHub invitation, consider changing your [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/people membership visibility] from &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;. This helps others know at a glance roughly how many contributors are involved with Bisq.

== Do valuable work and get compensated ==

After browsing GitHub repositories and Matrix discussions, you will start to develop a sense for what&amp;#x27;s happening, what&amp;#x27;s needed, and where you can help:

# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Find a problem somewhere in Bisq-land&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that (a) needs fixing and (b) is a match for your skills and interests. Browse critical bugs, open bounties, follow chats on Matrix and the forums, and ask around about what other contributors think needs fixing. 
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Get assigned to an issue&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or have your initiative acknowledged in some other way. While you don’t strictly need anybody’s permission to do anything for Bisq, you’ll want to make sure there&amp;#x27;s buy-in from other contributors so your work is received well. Otherwise, there are no guarantees that your work will be merged, reviewed, or eligible for compensation.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do work to fix that problem&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Submit your fix for review with a pull request (for code and documentation changes) or with a GitHub issue (for everything else).
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Request that others review your work&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The best way to do this is by writing good commit comments and pull request/issue descriptions that clearly explain the problem your work is intended to solve, why it’s important, and why you fixed it the way you did. Make it as easy as possible for others to review your work. Make it a pleasure for others to review your work.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Incorporate review feedback&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; you get until your fix gets merged or is otherwise accepted.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Repeat&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; steps 1–5.
# [[compensation|Submit a compensation request]] toward the end of the cycle.

{{Admonition Note|As you&amp;#x27;ll see from browsing the various repositories on GitHub, changes to Bisq are almost always discussed publicly. This helps maintain Bisq&amp;#x27;s commitment to transparency, invites feedback to improve the quality of contributions, and it helps keep compensation honest. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Always try to make sure your work is documented somewhere so others can follow its progress and offer feedback.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;}}

Ultimately, please remember that all Bisq contributors participate on a voluntary basis, and the more energy and quality you bring to the table, the more existing contributors will be encouraged to pay you attention.

Regarding development, keep in mind that reviewing other contributors&amp;#x27; work can be highly valuable as well (both to the project, and also to yourself as a way to learn how Bisq works). Quality code reviews are eligible for compensation just like any other contribution.

== Consider if you would like to become a Burning Man ==

For contributors wanting to receive regular bitcoin payments they may consider becoming performing a role as one of the Bisq [[Burning Men]]. It would be worth Bisq contributors understanding the pros and cons to becoming a burning man to decide if it is something they would like to do.</text></revision></page><page><title>Reputation</title><ns>0</ns><id>569</id><revision><id>3768</id><timestamp>2024-10-04T02:25:59Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The security model of [[Bisq Easy]] (a [[Bisq 2]] trade protocol) is based on the seller&amp;#x27;s reputation.

As the buyer needs to send the fiat payment first in the trade process, the seller needs to provide reputation so that the buyer can trust the seller to send the bitcoin.

Buyers should look to choose sellers with a high reputation for their trades.

Sellers should look at how to maximize their reputation to ensure they get more trades.

From Bisq 2 version 2.1.1 the maximum recommended trade amount depends on the seller&amp;#x27;s reputation. The higher their reputation the higher the possible trade amount (up to a ceiling of the bitcoin amount equivalent to 600 USD). Version 2.1.1 also introduces a change in the reputation score calculation, so that burned BSQ and bonded BSQ get twice their value in the course of the first year.

[[File:Reputation-section-new.png|400px|thumb|left|The reputation section can be found on the left hand menu in Bisq 2]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Reputation based trade limits ==

A seller can take offers up to the amount derived from their reputation score. 

The formula is: `Reputation score / 200 = max. trade amount in USD`. In other words, for each USD the seller needs 200 reputation points. A reputation score of 30000 enables trades up to 150 USD (converted to the chosen fiat currency).

For small trade amounts of the value 25 USD and below, this restriction is lifted. This is motivated by the lower risk of such small amounts and to give users more flexibility.

The reputation based trade limits means a buyer creating an offer can be sure the taker (seller) has an adequate reputation score. In case the offer allows amounts below 25 USD anyone with low or no reputation can take the offer. Maker&amp;#x27;s who do not want to allow users with no reputation to be able to take their offer should create offers higher than 25 USD.

A seller creating an offer will get shown the max amount which is covered by their reputation score. They still can create offers with higher amounts, but a taker will get displayed a warning about the potential risks. 
 
== Minimum and maximum trade amounts ==

Prior to v2.1.1 the minimum and maximum trade amounts were set to 0.0001 - 0.01 BTC. With v2.1.1 we use the fixed fiat amount (independent of Bitcoin price) of 6 USD - 600 USD (converted to the chosen currency). This avoids fluctuations in case of price volatility.

[[File:Minimum-maximum-trade-amounts.png|400px|thumb|left|The minimum and maximum trade amounts for Bisq 2 Easy are between 6 USD and 600 USD or your chosen fiat equivalent]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Minimum required reputation score ==

Prior to v2.1.1 users could set a minimum required reputation score for sellers in the settings, or use the recommended default value (30000). This has been removed in v2.1.1. as the amount based approach is a better way to handle risk.

[[File:Minimum-required-reputation-score.png|400px|thumb|left|Bisq will give you a warning if you try and trade with a user with less than the required reputation score.]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Transition and backward compatibility with prior versions ==

As long there are users who run versions prior to v2.1.1. we need to deal with some backward compatibility cases.

An offer created by a version prior to 2.1.1 can be taken by users of v2.1.1 up to 25 USD even the reputation score is insufficient as we have for such relative small amounts the requirements relaxed. In case a maker who have set the min. required reputation score to a higher level as the taker of the offer has, can reject that trade without risking penalty. The mediator can assist in doubt.

Buy offers created with v2.1.1 have set the min. required reputation score to 30000 independent of the users setting (as that has been removed). Thus sellers still using a version lower than v2.1.1. need to have at least 30000 reputation score to take that buy offer.


== Reputation score star system ==

To make it easier for user&amp;#x27;s to compare the reputation scores of different traders, Bisq displays reputation scores as stars (0-5 stars).

To achieve this users&amp;#x27; total reputation scores are compared to other scores in the network and ranked and normalized to a value between 0 and 1.

The user with the highest ranking will have a value of 5 stars. The user with the lowest ranking will have a value of 0 stars.

The user profiles only stay for 2 weeks in the network in case a user is not active. Thus their associated reputation will disappear with their profile if being inactive for 2 weeks. This has an impact on the relative reputation score of all other users. For instance if the user with the highest reputation is inactive and gets removed from the network the next user with the highest reputation will become the highest ranked with 5 star. Once a inactive user becomes active again their reputation score will be taken into account in the relative ranking.

One could phrase it as: The reputation score star system is the relative ranking compared to the reputation of the active users in the network.

[[File:Reputation-ranking-new.png|400px|thumb|left|Bisq converts a seller&amp;#x27;s reputation score into an easy to view star system. This makes it easy for buyers to see at a glance which are the most reputable sellers. The sellers with the highest reputation have 5 stars and the sellers with the lowest reputation will have 0 stars.]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Why is Reputation important for sellers ==

Bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment to the sellers prior to receiving the bitcoin. Therefore it is important for bitcoin sellers to have a good reputation to help establish trust with their potential trade partners.

It is expected that users that want to gain reputation to be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will be experienced Bisq users that can provide buyers with a positive experience.

Selling bitcoin on Bisq Easy is expected to be profitable for the sellers in that they will likely choose to sell bitcoin over market price.

== How to build reputation ==

There are currently 4 options for creating reputation:

* Burning BSQ
* Setting up a BSQ bond
* Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1
* Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1

The total score is calculated as sum of the individual reputation sources/events. The reputation scores of users&amp;#x27; will change over time due to:

* Reputation gained from bonding BSQ is lost when the bond is unlocked.
* Users can burn or bond BSQ repeatedly.
* Users can import signed accounts or aged accounts to replace previous gained reputation scores.

Also the representation of the reputation as stars next to the user profile will also change over time in respect of the score of other users profile IDs.

It is expected that there will be some competition between sellers to achieve higher reputation scores to get more trades from bitcoin buyers interested in trading with account with the most reputation.

You can access all 4 methods of increasing your reputation from the Bisq 2 reputation section found in &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Reputation-section.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

=== Burning BSQ ===


A user who wants to improve their reputation on the Bisq Easy trade protocol can can burn BSQ.

The more BSQ that is burned the better the reputation score the user would get. 

The minimum amount of BSQ that can be burnt is 5.46 BSQ (dust limit).

The reputation score achieved by burning BSQ increases linearly over the first twelve months. At the end of the 12 months the reputation score gained will be double what it was initially. This is to give an advantage to sellers over the long term.

The value gained by burning BSQ persists over time. Reputation scores achieved from burning BSQ is cumulative. It can be assumed that regular burning (e.g. each week or month) is a form of work and represents activity by the user resulting in a higher reputation score.

Data about the burned BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node.

If a user gets banned by a moderator they will lose the reputation value that they gained from burning the BSQ as the reputation is linked to their profile and a banned profile cannot be used anymore.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to burn BSQ for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation
# Copy the &amp;quot;profile ID&amp;quot;
# Open Bisq 1 and go to &amp;quot;DAO/PROOF OF BURN&amp;quot; and paste the copied value into the &amp;quot;pre-image&amp;quot; field
# Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn
# Publish the Burn BSQ transaction
# After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile

On the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Burning-bsq-reputation.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

Burning BSQ has the highest impact on the reputation score.

For every BSQ burnt the user receives a reputation score of 100. This amount will increase linearly over the first twelve months until it doubles.

For example if a user burns 100 BSQ their reputation score will be increased by 10,000 immediately, and by the end of the 12 months it will have increased to 20,000. 

Reputation obtained by burning will persist with that users profile.

To increase their reputation further a user can burn multiple times. The scores received are cumulative.

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Setting up a BSQ bond ===

Similar to Burn BSQ but using refundable BSQ bonds. 

BSQ needs to be bonded for a minimum of 50,000 blocks (about 1 year). During this time the BSQ is unavailable to the user. After 50,000 blocks the bond can be unlocked and the BSQ is available again to the user. 

The reputation score achieved by bonding BSQ increases linearly over the first twelve months. At the end of the 12 months the reputation score gained will be double what it was initially. This is to give an advantage to sellers over the long term.

The value gained by bonding BSQ persists until the time the bond is unlocked. Reputation scores achieved from bonding BSQ is cumulative. It can be assumed that regular bonding (e.g. each week or month) is a form of work and represents activity by the user resulting in a higher reputation score.

A bond can be confiscated (destroyed by a Bisq DAO vote). This would only be done if a bond holder was scamming users. To confiscate a scammers bond requires high quorum at DAO voting, thus its more risky that the confiscation might fail.

Data about bonded BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to bond BSQ for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation
# Copy the &amp;quot;profile ID&amp;quot;
# Open Bisq 1 and go to &amp;quot;DAO/BONDING/BONDED REPUTATION&amp;quot; and paste the copied value into the &amp;quot;salt&amp;quot; field
# Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lockup and the lock time (50000 blocks)
# Publish the lockup transaction
# After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile

On the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Bonding-bsq-reputation.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

Bonding BSQ has a high impact on the reputation score.

For every BSQ bonded the user receives a reputation score of 10. This amount will increase linearly over the first twelve months until it doubles.

For example if a user bonds 1,000 BSQ their reputation score will be increased by 10,000 immediately, and by the end of the 12 months it will have increased to 20,000. 

Reputation obtained by burning will persist with that users profile.

To increase their reputation further a user can bond multiple times. The scores received are cumulative. 

Once the bond is unlocked the reputation score attributed to that bond is lost. 

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1 ===

Users of Bisq 1 can gain reputation by importing their account age from Bisq 1 into Bisq 2. 

Accounts ages from Bisq 1 could include any of the following account types:

Any Fiat account can be used.

The older the user&amp;#x27;s account age the more trustworthy the user will be assumed to be. 

In case of repeated registrations the oldest account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to import your account age from Bisq 1 for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Open the account age reputation section on Bisq 2
# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation
# Copy the &amp;quot;profile ID&amp;quot; to paste on Bisq 1
# Open Bisq 1 and go to &amp;quot;ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS&amp;quot;
# Select the oldest account and click &amp;#x27;Export Account&amp;#x27;
# This will add a signed message with the Bisq 2 profile ID
# Paste the signature from Bisq 1 in the account age reputation section on Bisq 2
# Press &amp;#x27;Request authorization&amp;#x27; button

On the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Age-bsq-reputation.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Importing an account age from Bisq 1 the lowest impact on the reputation score.

For every day old the user&amp;#x27;s account is they will receive a reputation score of 2.5. For example if a user imports a 300 day old account from Bisq 1 their reputation score will be increased by 750. Reputation obtained from importing their account age will be cumulative with all other reputation scores the user obtains.

A user cannot obtain the minimum reputation score required from importing their account age alone, they would need to burn or bond BSQ to achieve this.

The maximum reputation score a user can achieve from importing an account age is 5,000. This can be achieved when importing accounts of 2,000 days old, or older. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1 ===

Users of Bisq 1 can gain reputation by importing their signed account age from Bisq 1 into Bisq 2.

Any signed account from Bisq 1 can be used.

The older the user&amp;#x27;s signed account age the more trustworthy the user will be assumed to be.

In case of repeated registrations the oldest signed account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated. account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to import your signed account age from Bisq 1 for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Open the account signed account age witness reputation section on Bisq 2
# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Importing a signed account age from Bisq 1  has a low impact on the reputation score.

For every day old the user&amp;#x27;s singed account is they will receive a reputation score of 5. For example if a user imports a 300 day old account from Bisq 1 their reputation score will be increased by 1500. Reputation obtained from importing their signed account age will be cumulative with all other reputation scores the user obtains.

A user cannot obtain the minimum reputation score required from importing their signed account age alone, they would need to burn or bond BSQ to achieve this. 

The maximum reputation score a user can achieve from importing a signed account is 10,000. This can be achieved when importing accounts of 2,000 days old, or older.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Reputation Simulation Tool ==

For bitcoin sellers it can get a little complicated to work out what the best way is to increase their reputation. To help make the decision process easier Bisq 2 provides a simulation tool for sellers to see what different actions they can take to increase their reputation.

The simulation tool can be access from the reputation system. It can be used for both burning and bonding BSQ. 

Here is an screenshot showing it in use for burning BSQ.

[[File:Burning-bsq-screen.png|400px|thumb|left|The tool allows you to see the reputation score you would get from Burning BSQ. Remember the score will increase linearly over the first 12 months. At the end of this period the reputation score will be double]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

Here is an screenshot showing it in use for bonding BSQ.

[[File:Bonding-bsq-screen.png|400px|thumb|left|The tool allows you to see the reputation score you would get from Bonding BSQ. Remember the score will increase linearly over the first 12 months. At the end of this period the reputation score will be double]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== What happens when a user profile ID is banned? ==

When a user profile ID is banned they lose all reputation associated with that profile ID.

The profile ID contains a pub key hash that is tied to a corresponding reputation score.

Once a user profile ID is banned their corresponding reputation score will no longer be visible. 

Moderators will ensure that they only ban profile IDs that have severely, or repeatedly, violated Bisq trade protocols. Banned users might be impacted in Bisq 1 as well (e.g. their onion address will be banned, or a BSQ bond confiscation proposal is made, if applicable).</text></revision></page><page><title>Reputation</title><ns>0</ns><id>569</id><revision><id>3768</id><timestamp>2024-10-04T02:25:59Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The security model of [[Bisq Easy]] (a [[Bisq 2]] trade protocol) is based on the seller&amp;#x27;s reputation.

As the buyer needs to send the fiat payment first in the trade process, the seller needs to provide reputation so that the buyer can trust the seller to send the bitcoin.

Buyers should look to choose sellers with a high reputation for their trades.

Sellers should look at how to maximize their reputation to ensure they get more trades.

From Bisq 2 version 2.1.1 the maximum recommended trade amount depends on the seller&amp;#x27;s reputation. The higher their reputation the higher the possible trade amount (up to a ceiling of the bitcoin amount equivalent to 600 USD). Version 2.1.1 also introduces a change in the reputation score calculation, so that burned BSQ and bonded BSQ get twice their value in the course of the first year.

[[File:Reputation-section-new.png|400px|thumb|left|The reputation section can be found on the left hand menu in Bisq 2]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Reputation based trade limits ==

A seller can take offers up to the amount derived from their reputation score. 

The formula is: `Reputation score / 200 = max. trade amount in USD`. In other words, for each USD the seller needs 200 reputation points. A reputation score of 30000 enables trades up to 150 USD (converted to the chosen fiat currency).

For small trade amounts of the value 25 USD and below, this restriction is lifted. This is motivated by the lower risk of such small amounts and to give users more flexibility.

The reputation based trade limits means a buyer creating an offer can be sure the taker (seller) has an adequate reputation score. In case the offer allows amounts below 25 USD anyone with low or no reputation can take the offer. Maker&amp;#x27;s who do not want to allow users with no reputation to be able to take their offer should create offers higher than 25 USD.

A seller creating an offer will get shown the max amount which is covered by their reputation score. They still can create offers with higher amounts, but a taker will get displayed a warning about the potential risks. 
 
== Minimum and maximum trade amounts ==

Prior to v2.1.1 the minimum and maximum trade amounts were set to 0.0001 - 0.01 BTC. With v2.1.1 we use the fixed fiat amount (independent of Bitcoin price) of 6 USD - 600 USD (converted to the chosen currency). This avoids fluctuations in case of price volatility.

[[File:Minimum-maximum-trade-amounts.png|400px|thumb|left|The minimum and maximum trade amounts for Bisq 2 Easy are between 6 USD and 600 USD or your chosen fiat equivalent]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Minimum required reputation score ==

Prior to v2.1.1 users could set a minimum required reputation score for sellers in the settings, or use the recommended default value (30000). This has been removed in v2.1.1. as the amount based approach is a better way to handle risk.

[[File:Minimum-required-reputation-score.png|400px|thumb|left|Bisq will give you a warning if you try and trade with a user with less than the required reputation score.]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Transition and backward compatibility with prior versions ==

As long there are users who run versions prior to v2.1.1. we need to deal with some backward compatibility cases.

An offer created by a version prior to 2.1.1 can be taken by users of v2.1.1 up to 25 USD even the reputation score is insufficient as we have for such relative small amounts the requirements relaxed. In case a maker who have set the min. required reputation score to a higher level as the taker of the offer has, can reject that trade without risking penalty. The mediator can assist in doubt.

Buy offers created with v2.1.1 have set the min. required reputation score to 30000 independent of the users setting (as that has been removed). Thus sellers still using a version lower than v2.1.1. need to have at least 30000 reputation score to take that buy offer.


== Reputation score star system ==

To make it easier for user&amp;#x27;s to compare the reputation scores of different traders, Bisq displays reputation scores as stars (0-5 stars).

To achieve this users&amp;#x27; total reputation scores are compared to other scores in the network and ranked and normalized to a value between 0 and 1.

The user with the highest ranking will have a value of 5 stars. The user with the lowest ranking will have a value of 0 stars.

The user profiles only stay for 2 weeks in the network in case a user is not active. Thus their associated reputation will disappear with their profile if being inactive for 2 weeks. This has an impact on the relative reputation score of all other users. For instance if the user with the highest reputation is inactive and gets removed from the network the next user with the highest reputation will become the highest ranked with 5 star. Once a inactive user becomes active again their reputation score will be taken into account in the relative ranking.

One could phrase it as: The reputation score star system is the relative ranking compared to the reputation of the active users in the network.

[[File:Reputation-ranking-new.png|400px|thumb|left|Bisq converts a seller&amp;#x27;s reputation score into an easy to view star system. This makes it easy for buyers to see at a glance which are the most reputable sellers. The sellers with the highest reputation have 5 stars and the sellers with the lowest reputation will have 0 stars.]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Why is Reputation important for sellers ==

Bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment to the sellers prior to receiving the bitcoin. Therefore it is important for bitcoin sellers to have a good reputation to help establish trust with their potential trade partners.

It is expected that users that want to gain reputation to be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will be experienced Bisq users that can provide buyers with a positive experience.

Selling bitcoin on Bisq Easy is expected to be profitable for the sellers in that they will likely choose to sell bitcoin over market price.

== How to build reputation ==

There are currently 4 options for creating reputation:

* Burning BSQ
* Setting up a BSQ bond
* Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1
* Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1

The total score is calculated as sum of the individual reputation sources/events. The reputation scores of users&amp;#x27; will change over time due to:

* Reputation gained from bonding BSQ is lost when the bond is unlocked.
* Users can burn or bond BSQ repeatedly.
* Users can import signed accounts or aged accounts to replace previous gained reputation scores.

Also the representation of the reputation as stars next to the user profile will also change over time in respect of the score of other users profile IDs.

It is expected that there will be some competition between sellers to achieve higher reputation scores to get more trades from bitcoin buyers interested in trading with account with the most reputation.

You can access all 4 methods of increasing your reputation from the Bisq 2 reputation section found in &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Reputation-section.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

=== Burning BSQ ===


A user who wants to improve their reputation on the Bisq Easy trade protocol can can burn BSQ.

The more BSQ that is burned the better the reputation score the user would get. 

The minimum amount of BSQ that can be burnt is 5.46 BSQ (dust limit).

The reputation score achieved by burning BSQ increases linearly over the first twelve months. At the end of the 12 months the reputation score gained will be double what it was initially. This is to give an advantage to sellers over the long term.

The value gained by burning BSQ persists over time. Reputation scores achieved from burning BSQ is cumulative. It can be assumed that regular burning (e.g. each week or month) is a form of work and represents activity by the user resulting in a higher reputation score.

Data about the burned BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node.

If a user gets banned by a moderator they will lose the reputation value that they gained from burning the BSQ as the reputation is linked to their profile and a banned profile cannot be used anymore.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to burn BSQ for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation
# Copy the &amp;quot;profile ID&amp;quot;
# Open Bisq 1 and go to &amp;quot;DAO/PROOF OF BURN&amp;quot; and paste the copied value into the &amp;quot;pre-image&amp;quot; field
# Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn
# Publish the Burn BSQ transaction
# After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile

On the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Burning-bsq-reputation.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

Burning BSQ has the highest impact on the reputation score.

For every BSQ burnt the user receives a reputation score of 100. This amount will increase linearly over the first twelve months until it doubles.

For example if a user burns 100 BSQ their reputation score will be increased by 10,000 immediately, and by the end of the 12 months it will have increased to 20,000. 

Reputation obtained by burning will persist with that users profile.

To increase their reputation further a user can burn multiple times. The scores received are cumulative.

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Setting up a BSQ bond ===

Similar to Burn BSQ but using refundable BSQ bonds. 

BSQ needs to be bonded for a minimum of 50,000 blocks (about 1 year). During this time the BSQ is unavailable to the user. After 50,000 blocks the bond can be unlocked and the BSQ is available again to the user. 

The reputation score achieved by bonding BSQ increases linearly over the first twelve months. At the end of the 12 months the reputation score gained will be double what it was initially. This is to give an advantage to sellers over the long term.

The value gained by bonding BSQ persists until the time the bond is unlocked. Reputation scores achieved from bonding BSQ is cumulative. It can be assumed that regular bonding (e.g. each week or month) is a form of work and represents activity by the user resulting in a higher reputation score.

A bond can be confiscated (destroyed by a Bisq DAO vote). This would only be done if a bond holder was scamming users. To confiscate a scammers bond requires high quorum at DAO voting, thus its more risky that the confiscation might fail.

Data about bonded BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to bond BSQ for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation
# Copy the &amp;quot;profile ID&amp;quot;
# Open Bisq 1 and go to &amp;quot;DAO/BONDING/BONDED REPUTATION&amp;quot; and paste the copied value into the &amp;quot;salt&amp;quot; field
# Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lockup and the lock time (50000 blocks)
# Publish the lockup transaction
# After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile

On the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under &amp;#x27;User Options&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;

[[File:Bonding-bsq-reputation.png|frame|left]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

Bonding BSQ has a high impact on the reputation score.

For every BSQ bonded the user receives a reputation score of 10. This amount will increase linearly over the first twelve months until it doubles.

For example if a user bonds 1,000 BSQ their reputation score will be increased by 10,000 immediately, and by the end of the 12 months it will have increased to 20,000. 

Reputation obtained by burning will persist with that users profile.

To increase their reputation further a user can bond multiple times. The scores received are cumulative. 

Once the bond is unlocked the reputation score attributed to that bond is lost. 

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1 ===

Users of Bisq 1 can gain reputation by importing their account age from Bisq 1 into Bisq 2. 

Accounts ages from Bisq 1 could include any of the following account types:

Any Fiat account can be used.

The older the user&amp;#x27;s account age the more trustworthy the user will be assumed to be. 

In case of repeated registrations the oldest account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Follow these steps to import your account age from Bisq 1 for reputation:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# Open the account age reputation section on Bisq 2
# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation
# Copy the &amp;quot;profile ID&amp;quot; to paste on Bisq 1
# Open Bisq 1 and go to &amp;quot;ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS&amp;quot;
# Select the oldest account and click &amp;#x27;Export Account&amp;#x27;
# This will add a signed message with the Bisq 2 profile ID
# Paste the signature from Bisq 1 in the account age reputation section on Bisq 2
# Press &amp;#x27;Request authorization&amp;#x27; button

&lt;pre&gt;
Importing an account age from Bisq 1 the lowest impact on the reputation score.

For every day old the user&amp;#x27;s account is they will receive a reputation score of 2.5. For example if a user imports a 300 day old account from Bisq 1 their reputation score will be increased by 750. Reputation obtained from importing their account age will be cumulative with all other reputation scores the user obtains.

A user cannot obtain the minimum reputation score required from importing their account age alone, they would need to burn or bond BSQ to achieve this.

The maximum reputation score a user can achieve from importing an account age is 5,000. This can be achieved when importing accounts of 2,000 days old, or older. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1 ===

Users of Bisq 1 can gain reputation by importing their signed account age from Bisq 1 into Bisq 2.

Any signed account from Bisq 1 can be used.

The older the user&amp;#x27;s signed account age the more trustworthy the user will be assumed to be.

In case of repeated registrations the oldest signed account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated. account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated.

&lt;pre&gt;
Importing a signed account age from Bisq 1  has a low impact on the reputation score.

For every day old the user&amp;#x27;s singed account is they will receive a reputation score of 5.

The maximum reputation score a user can achieve from importing a signed account is 10,000. This can be achieved when importing accounts of 2,000 days old, or older.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Reputation Simulation Tool ==

For bitcoin sellers it can get a little complicated to work out what the best way is to increase their reputation. To help make the decision process easier Bisq 2 provides a simulation tool for sellers to see what different actions they can take to increase their reputation.

The simulation tool can be access from the reputation system. It can be used for both burning and bonding BSQ. 

Here is an screenshot showing it in use for burning BSQ.

[[File:Burning-bsq-screen.png|400px|thumb|left|The tool allows you to see the reputation score you would get from Burning BSQ. Remember the score will increase linearly over the first 12 months. At the end of this period the reputation score will be double]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

Here is an screenshot showing it in use for bonding BSQ.

[[File:Bonding-bsq-screen.png|400px|thumb|left|The tool allows you to see the reputation score you would get from Bonding BSQ. Remember the score will increase linearly over the first 12 months. At the end of this period the reputation score will be double]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== What happens when a user profile ID is banned? ==

When a user profile ID is banned they lose all reputation associated with that profile ID.

The profile ID contains a pub key hash that is tied to a corresponding reputation score.

Once a user profile ID is banned their corresponding reputation score will no longer be visible. 

Moderators will ensure that they only ban profile IDs that have severely, or repeatedly, violated Bisq trade protocols. Banned users might be impacted in Bisq 1 as well (e.g. their onion address will be banned, or a BSQ bond confiscation proposal is made, if applicable).</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Create buy offers screenshot 1.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>576</id><revision><id>3378</id><timestamp>2023-11-13T17:23:56Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

Matrix replaced Keybase as the main Bisq messaging platform around January 2022. If you are still using Keybase it is recommended to move over to Matrix by visiting [https://bisq.chat/ bisq.chat].

== Matrix ==

[http://www.matrix.org Matrix.org] is a secure, decentralized, real-time communication tool [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/355 replacing Keybase], the tool previously used by Bisq prior to 2022. 
Bisq self-hosts [https://bisq.chat/ bisq.chat], a Matrix team server, which takes a step further on the grade of censorship-resistance and privacy.

== Using Matrix ==

=== Web interface ===

Matrix can be used as a web based app. That&amp;#x27;s a big advantage, specially for users only requiring occasional support and who don&amp;#x27;t need to keep on the day to day conversations.
To start using [bisq.chat] just click the link and you&amp;#x27;ll see a page like this:

[[File:Matrix 1.png|400px|thumb|left]] 

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;continue&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and many Matrix clients will be displayed. Select Element, which is one of the most popular and can be used without installing software. Click the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;continue in your browser&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; button and the [https://app.element.io/#/room/#bisq:bitcoin.kyoto web app Element] will load.
Click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;join&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;create account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, as we suppose you don&amp;#x27;t have a matrix account yet. Next image shows fields needed to host the account at matrix.org. There are other hosts requiring different data to join.

[[File:Matrix create account.png|500px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Joining channels ====

Once the matrix.org hosting account has been created, you&amp;#x27;ll see the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.general:bitcoin.kyoto General] and [[User_support|Support]] channel. &lt;/br&gt;
Click on the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;+&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; sign on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and then &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Explore rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to join other channels, for example [[getting your first BTC|Get your first BTC]].

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Security deposits&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in Bisq are BTC funds that buyer and seller lock in a 2of2 multisig address together with trade funds when an offer is taken in order to help ensure that both peers follow the trading protocol. Security deposits are fully reimbursed automatically to both trading peers when the trade ends without [[dispute resolution | disputes]].

Security deposits are the most important tool Bisq offers to protect honest traders. Furthermore, requiring &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; parties to post a deposit increases chances that they will be willing to cooperate and determine amicable outcomes in case a trade doesn&amp;#x27;t go according to plan.

When a trade doesn&amp;#x27;t go the happy path, a portion or the total amount of the offending peer&amp;#x27;s deposit will be lost, depending on whether the trade is concluded in mediation or arbitration. For example, it is considered a protocol violation when the buyer doesn&amp;#x27;t pay the seller as specified in the trade contract (e.g., late payment, mismatching names, wrong payment method, etc). [[Trading_rules|This article]] lists all Bisq trading rules.

== Note for new users ==

Security deposits create a conundrum for new users: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;bitcoin is required to buy bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This can be inconvenient, but it&amp;#x27;s a core part of the security protocol. The initial amount of BTC required to do a trade can vary depending on the payment method, but the bare minimum BTC required to buy more BTC (as of this writing) is 0.002 BTC to cover the minimum security deposit and mining fees. Take a look at [[Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin|this article]] for suggestion on how to get this initial BTC without KYC ([[Bisq Easy]], [[Getting_your_first_BTC|Get your first BTC]] room, a friend, ATM, sell something, work for it, etc).

Why the hard security deposit requirement? Bisq never custodies your funds, and it avoids reputation mechanisms that would weaken your privacy (e.g., reviews: to such reputation data, it must be stored somewhere &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; tied to an identity). Such mechanisms would only give a false sense of security anyway due to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attacks].

== Recommended amounts ==

Bisq allows offer makers to choose a security deposit percentage: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;minimum is 15%&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of trade amount and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;maximum is 50%&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of trade amount (absolute minimum is 0.001 BTC). The offer taker must deposit the same amount as the offer maker.

When creating an offer, Bisq recommends a security deposit based on recent volatility of the asset being traded: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;the higher the volatility, the higher the recommended security deposit&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Using the recommended amount helps prevent trades from becoming future trades where the BTC buyer only sends payment to settle the trade if the BTC price has not fallen enough to compensate for losing the security deposit.

{{Admonition_Note|Deposits and trade amounts are locked in the multisignature address to secure trades. So a peer selling 1 BTC who chooses to specify a 25% security deposit when making his offer will need to lock 1.25 BTC, which would require the buyer to lock 0.25 BTC when taking the offer. Ultimately, this means 1.5 BTC will be locked in a 2-of-2 multisig address when the deposit transaction is confirmed, and only at that point can the buyer send payment to the seller.}}

[[File:Security deposit 1.png|500px|thumb|left|Depending on volatility, recommended security deposits can reach 50%.]]
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

When taking an offer, the security deposit set by the maker can be viewed on the &lt;code&gt;Deposit BTC (%)&lt;/code&gt; column. 
[[File:Security deposit 2.png|500px|thumb|left|See required deposit % in this column on the offer book.]]
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Reduced peer&amp;#x27;s deposit payout during arbitration ==

The latest trade protocol, which introduced contributors as BurningMen, to eliminate the single-point-of-failure that was the legacy BurningMan, implies that the trader winning in arbitration will get a considerably smaller (if at all) portion of the peer&amp;#x27;s deposit as compensation, to account for the risk of malicious BM&amp;#x27;s exploiting the protocol itself.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to minimize the risk of having funds locked in arbitration for a prolonged time without any compensation after the resolution, you should take into account [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/411 this table], and set a deposit % higher than the minimum amount possible, which will yield no compensation whatsoever.</text></revision></page><page><title>Introduction to the DAO</title><ns>0</ns><id>402</id><revision><id>3692</id><timestamp>2024-08-25T16:11:28Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The Bisq network is governed by a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; built on the Bitcoin blockchain.

== Introduction ==

=== What is a DAO? ===

Conventional entities such as for-profit and non-profit corporations must be sanctioned by the state: they are legal entities registered in particular jurisdictions. No matter how big or small or virtuous or innovative they are, they cannot operate without state approval. In return for this approval, the entity is endowed with rights (e.g., limited liability) and responsibilities (e.g., taxes).

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is just a generic term for a governance model sanctioned by software: code defines conventions for governing the project irrespective of the stance of the state.

{{Admonition_Note|We say a DAO’s governance model must be sanctioned by software, not necessarily controlled by software. The Bisq DAO, for example, is not controlled by software: software merely provides a framework for the people involved with the Bisq project to (collectively) manage the software itself. The Bisq DAO operates on the idea that &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;code is not law&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Code is written by humans to provide a service to other humans, so it should be accountable to humans too. }}

The universe of DAOs is diverse. Just as companies come in many shapes and sizes, and some companies are scammy, fraudulent, or just poorly managed—that’s no reason to assume all companies are the same way. It’s the same with DAOs: some DAOs haven’t worked out so well, but others might turn out differently.

== The Bisq DAO ==

The Bisq DAO forgoes a system where governance is dictated by the rigid rules of software in favor of a self-contained economy where governance is guided by software but ultimately determined by the collective, subjective judgments of its community.

It achieves this by introducing a unit of value called the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ token&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that enables Bisq stakeholders—contributors, traders, or anyone who owns BSQ—to make subjective value judgments. This token underlies all actions in the DAO.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvOZlIDYEQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo Click here for a quick introductory video on the what &amp;amp; why of the Bisq DAO]

=== BSQ token ===

{{BSQ_Token_Intro}}

=== Overview ===

Here’s a graphical overview of how the DAO works at a high level:

[[File:User-dao-diagram.png|700px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Let’s observe some of the dynamics of this system:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

* Contributors &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;maintain&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq through valuable work 
* Traders &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;use&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
* Contributors &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;earn&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BSQ tokens when their compensation requests are approved through voting
* Traders &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BSQ tokens in order to pay lower trading fees
* Stakeholders &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;vote&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on compensation requests
* Contributors can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;lock&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; a bond in BSQ to ensure integrity in high-trust roles&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Now let’s see how these dynamics enable the Bisq DAO to provide 3 core governance functions without any central points of authority.

=== Earn and distribute revenue ===

Every project needs to be financially sustainable to fund ongoing operations and development. But traditional means of handling revenue and revenue distribution are necessarily centralized—any receiving address or account must be owned by one person, or a small group; determining how much a person should be paid must be determined by one person, or a small group; etc.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Contributors produce, creating BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In the Bisq DAO, trading fees are collected from traders and distributed to contributors, but there is no central authority to do this. Here’s how it works: after a Bisq contributor does work, they file a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;compensation request&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in the DAO with a description of what they did and how much BSQ they want in return. Then, stakeholders (who are other contributors, traders, and anyone else with BSQ) vote for/against the request. If the request is approved, the contributor is issued new BSQ in the amount they requested and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ supply is increased&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

{{Admonition_Note|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&lt;big&gt;Where does new BSQ actually come from?&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&lt;/br&gt; Recall that a BSQ token is merely colored bitcoin. When a contributor makes their compensation request in the DAO, they must also include the tiny amount of bitcoin to be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;colored&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; as BSQ (the [[DAO_technical_overview|spec]] requires 100 satoshis). So if a contributor requests 1,000 BSQ, they will need to include (100 * 1,000 equals 100,000 satoshis) with their compensation request, just about 10 USD at a rate of (10,000 USD/BTC).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;If their request is approved, those satoshis are &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;colored&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and recognized as 1,000 valid BSQ tokens on Bisq. Assuming a BSQ market value of 1 USD (exact value will fluctuate), the contributor will have been granted 1,000 USD worth of BSQ for a negligible cost of 10 USD.}}

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Traders consume, burning BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Then, a trader looking for lower trading fees can buy those BSQ tokens from a contributor. When they buy BSQ tokens for BTC, the contributor is paid for their work, and the value transfer from producer to consumer is complete! When a trader pays trading fees with BSQ, those BSQ tokens are burned or &amp;quot;decolored&amp;quot; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ supply is decreased&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This process of creating and destroying BSQ tokens enables a sort of [https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html#how-bsq-decentralizes-compensation-and-enables-monetary-policy monetary policy] controlled by Bisq stakeholders and traders.

In this way, there is no need for a central entity to collect and distribute revenue: the BSQ token enables a transfer of value from producer to consumer without any single entity controlling any aspect of the decision-making or distribution process.
{{Admonition_Note|&lt;big&gt;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Note on BTC revenues&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
In the past, before the Bisq DAO launch and before the integration of Bisq’s new trade protocol, trading fees were only collected in BTC and only went to arbitrators. There was no mechanism to distribute them to other contributors. The DAO solves this distribution problem with BSQ through the process outlined above.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
But since traders can still pay trading fees with BTC, where do those BTC fees go?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
BTC fees go to the [[Burning Men]], contributors that burn BSQ to get the chance to receive platform fees.

=== Determine strategy ===

Another point of centralization in traditional organizations is with strategy. How can a project determine strategy without some form of designated leadership: an executive, manager, or leader to give direction and allocate resources?

The Bisq DAO beats this tradition with collective decision-making on strategy and other matters through &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;weighted voting&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; based on BSQ stake.

Here’s how it works: any stakeholder can make a proposal in the DAO. It can be anything: a change in a trading parameter, a new bonded role, or even something more generic like an adjustment of overall project strategy. Stakeholders vote on the proposal, and their voting weight is based on BSQ stake, through a combination of two metrics:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

# amount of BSQ committed to a particular vote
# amount of BSQ earned over time through contributions&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Taking both metrics into account discourages deep-pocketed whales from suddenly seizing control of the project, while still valuing dedicated stakeholders with consistent contributions over time. It brings about a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;strict meritocracy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in which people need to somehow buy in to the Bisq project in order to take part in its governance, and the more significant their stake, the stronger their voice.

In this way, there is no need to rely on a single leadership team for direction: the community collectively manages itself.

=== Ensure honesty in high-trust roles ===

Despite the Bisq project’s attempts to resist concentrating control as much as possible, it’s impossible to avoid in some places. Domain name owners, social account admins, mediators, various node operators: these are all roles that must exist, but necessarily retain significant control and require a high degree of trust.

Part of the benefit of a centralized team of thoroughly-vetted people reliant on a paycheck, as is the case in most companies, is that the risk of trusting people with significant responsibility is lower: they have a lot to lose if the company finds they have violated their integrity and engaged in foul play.

This dynamic can be reproduced—at least partly—in a project without a central authority through &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;bonding&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The concept is simple enough: create skin in the game. Require that a person interested in taking on a high-trust role post a bond that’s high enough to discourage them from engaging in foul play.

But what happens if that person goes rogue? In a project without central authority, who decides when they’ve crossed the line, and what their fate should be?

As with strategy and compensation, the community decides through voting. Anyone who suspects foul play can make a case for confiscating a bond with a new proposal, and stakeholders vote to determine an outcome.

{{Admonition_Warn|Confiscating a bond is a harsh penalty which should not be taken lightly. Therefore, the Bisq DAO makes confiscation proposals especially hard to approve: they require a quorum of at least 200,000 BSQ and 85% acceptance to pass (instead of the typical &gt;50%).}}

In this way, the risk that people in high-trust roles misbehave is minimized, and the community has access to a responsible mechanism for handling such a scenario in cases that warrant it.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The Bisq network is organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s purpose is to make the Bisq&amp;#x27;s governance model as decentralized and censorship-resistant as the Bisq network itself.

The Bisq founders realized that decentralized software—no matter how technically robust—is no good if it’s still controlled by a single entity. All the software’s technical strength would be worthless if the whole project could be ruined by attacking the single entity that runs it.

Thus the need for decentralizing the resources in charge of running Bisq itself. These resources cannot be organized in the form of a company, a nonprofit, or any other traditional organization because a single entity would be a single point of failure. But what to do? How can a project do anything useful without becoming an organization with some kind of structure? How can strategy be determined? How can resources be allocated? How can work get done? How can revenue be earned, and how can it be distributed?

The Bisq project needed infrastructure to provide these functions, and the Bisq DAO is its solution.

{{Admonition_Note|You do not have to participate in any aspect of the DAO or BSQ to use Bisq, but you may find it interesting. It&amp;#x27;s built entirely on Bitcoin and been operating since early 2019 without major issue.

The Arch User Repository (AUR) can from time to time become outdated, containing a version of Bisq that will not be able to trade on the p2p network.

At the time of writing, AUR contains 1.8.0, but current version is 1.8.2; the following instructions should get you a working setup.

=== Method 1: edit the cloned repository ===

This method has been user-tested and reported for migration from 1.8.0 to 1.8.2.

Clone the AUR package for bisq  curent version 1.8.0 and change to download directory&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/bisq.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cd bisq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Edit the PKGBUILD file changing the version, and updating the sha256 checksum for the bisq-1.8.2.tar.gz file

&lt;code&gt;nano PKGBUILD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;vi PKGBUILD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

and then change&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pkgver=1.8.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pkgver=1.8.2&lt;/code&gt;

and

&lt;code&gt;sha256sums=(&amp;#x27;ca636152863a9cc587d8d2b00476abd6fab854ae0b3513950d001f23cb0a1a53&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

then build and install bisq:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;makepkg -si&lt;/code&gt;

=== Method 2: run the binaries downloaded from the official website ===
The following method will work with any future version of Bisq.

Download the deb package from https://bisq.network/downloads/, open it using archive manager, and extract to disk the file data.tar.xz inside of it, then run &lt;code&gt;opt/bisq/bin/Bisq&lt;/code&gt; under the directory you extracted it to.</text></revision></page><page><title>Running Bisq on Tails</title><ns>0</ns><id>155</id><revision><id>3603</id><timestamp>2024-06-02T18:15:43Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

Unlike most operating systems, [https://tails.boum.org/about/ Tails runs &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;entirely&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in memory.] When Tails shuts down, memory contents are deleted, restoring the OS to its original state. Only files saved to the [https://tails.boum.org/doc/persistent_storage/ Persistent Storage] survive a reboot.

Therefore, Bisq must be reinstalled (and configured) after every boot. More importantly, Bisq&amp;#x27;s [[data directory|default data directory]] must be relocated to the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Persistent Storage&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; so that your wallet, keys, etc. are not lost every time Tails shuts down.

This is easy to automate with an installation script.

== Preparations ==
=== Configure Tails ===

On the Tails [https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/ Welcome Screen:]
* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/ Set up an administration password.]
* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/persistent_storage/create/ Create Persistent Storage.]

Once Persistent Storage has been created, a settings window will open automatically. You can also open it from the desktop menu:  &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Tails&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Persistent Storage&lt;/code&gt;.
* Enable the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Persistent Folder&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in the above settings.

=== Configure the Persistent Folder ===

* Create a directory to store the Bisq installer (and installation script):
:&lt;code&gt;mkdir /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/&lt;/code&gt;
* Create a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;persistent data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; for your Bisq user data:
:&lt;code&gt;mkdir /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/&lt;/code&gt;

==== Import user data from backup ====

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;WARNING:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Ensure that the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]] is EMPTY before importing. Do NOT mix user data from different sessions.}}

If you wish to import user data from a previous Bisq installation or backup, copy it into the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]]:
*&lt;code&gt;cp -ra /[backupdirectory]/bisq_backup_version001/. /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/&lt;/code&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;N.B.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; The correct path to your &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt; directory should now be:
:&lt;code&gt;/home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt;

=== Download Bisq ===

* [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Download] and [[Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file|verify]] the Debian (.deb) version of the Bisq installer.
* Move the installer file to the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|Bisq installer directory]]:
:&lt;code&gt;mv /path/to/[yourdownload.deb] /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/&lt;/code&gt;

=== Create installation script ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOTE:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; The script below will install Bisq, configure Tor, and redirect user data to the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]] (by creating a &amp;#x27;symbolic link&amp;#x27;). Every step in the script is explained via &amp;#x27;echo&amp;#x27; commands.

* Create a new script file:
:&lt;code&gt;touch /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/install-bisq.sh&lt;/code&gt;
* Make the file executable:
:&lt;code&gt;chmod +x /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/install-bisq.sh&lt;/code&gt;
* Edit the file, and save the script below.
* On the second line, replace [yourdownload.deb] with the filename of the [[#Download_Bisq|Bisq installer you downloaded]].

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Run Bisq ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOTE:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Your user data is safely stored in the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]]. However, the Bisq application is &amp;#x27;uninstalled&amp;#x27; every time Tails shuts down.

To install Bisq:

* Connect to the Tor network, via the desktop menu:
:&lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Internet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Tor Connection&lt;/code&gt;
* Run the [[#Create_installation_script|installation script]]:
:&lt;code&gt;sudo sh /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/install-bisq.sh&lt;/code&gt;

Once Bisq has been installed, you can either start it from the desktop menu:
*&lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Internet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;
Or via terminal:
*&lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq --torControlPort 951 --torControlCookieFile=/var/run/tor/control.authcookie --torControlUseSafeCookieAuth&lt;/code&gt;

== Maintenance ==
=== Backup user data ===

==== While Bisq is running ====

You can [[Backing_up_application_data#While_Bisq_is_running|backup while Bisq is running]], as normal.

==== While Bisq is closed ====

You can also backup while Bisq is closed, by copying your user data to a backup location. However:

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;REMEMBER:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Your user data is stored in the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]], and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOT&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq&amp;#x27;s [[data directory|default data directory]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;WARNING:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Only backup data into an EMPTY directory. Do NOT mix user data from different sessions.}}

To backup, first create a new (empty) directory for the backup, then copy the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]]. For example:
*&lt;code&gt;mkdir /[backupdirectory]/bisq_backup_version001&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;cp -ra /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/. /[backupdirectory]/bisq_backup_version001&lt;/code&gt;

=== Upgrade Bisq to the latest version ===

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;WARNING:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Do not downgrade Bisq. Installing an older version could cause irreversible damage to Bisq data.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOTE&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Before upgrading, it is recommended to [[#Backup_user_data|backup your user data]].}}

To upgrade Bisq:

* [[#Download_Bisq|Download Bisq]] to &lt;code&gt;/home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/&lt;/code&gt;
* Update the &lt;code&gt;BisqInstaller=&lt;/code&gt; line of the [[#Create_installation_script|installation script]] with the filename of the new version.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

This guide shows &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;how to run Bisq in a dedicated qube in QubesOS&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The steps were tested using QubesOS 4.0.3 and a Bisq qube based on the &lt;code&gt;debian-10&lt;/code&gt; template.

__TOC__

= How to setup =

== In dom0 ==

Execute the following steps in dom0.

=== Create qube ===

Create a new dedicated qube called &lt;code&gt;bisq-vm&lt;/code&gt; based on the &lt;code&gt;debian-10&lt;/code&gt; template.

* Q Menu &gt; Create Qubes VM &gt; Qube based on a template
* Template: choose &lt;code&gt;debian-10&lt;/code&gt;
* Check &amp;quot;Launch settings after creation&amp;quot;
* Press OK

Within a few seconds, the qube is created and the Qube Settings popup opens. Adjust it as follows:

* Basic &gt; Disk Storage
** Set &amp;quot;Private Storage max size&amp;quot; to at least &lt;code&gt;5000 MiB&lt;/code&gt; [1]
* Advanced &gt; Memory / CPU
** Set &amp;quot;Initial memory&amp;quot; to &lt;code&gt;6000 MB&lt;/code&gt; [2]
** Set &amp;quot;vCPUs no.&amp;quot; to &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;
** Uncheck &amp;quot;Include in memory balancing&amp;quot; [3]
* Press OK

== In dedicated qube ==

Execute the following steps in the &lt;code&gt;bisq-vm&lt;/code&gt; qube.

=== Create binding dirs ===

Create the binding dirs needed for the Bisq installation:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/opt/bisq
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/usr/share/desktop-directories
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart the qube to apply the binding dir settings.

=== Configure binding dirs ===

Setup the binding dirs mapping for the system folders needed for the Bisq installation:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Specify which system folders are mapped to binding dirs. To do that, create the configuration file:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

and populate it with the following lines [5] :

&lt;pre&gt;
binds+=( &amp;#x27;/opt/bisq&amp;#x27; )
binds+=( &amp;#x27;/usr/share/desktop-directories&amp;#x27; )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Install Bisq ===

=== Download Debian package ===

Go to the [https://bisq.network/downloads Bisq Downloads] page and download the Debian package and the corresponding PGP signature.

==== Verify PGP signature ====

Check that the downloaded package matches the signature [4]. Assuming the files were downloaded in the Downloads folder:

&lt;pre&gt;
# Go to the folder where you downloaded the .deb package and the PGP signature
cd Downloads

# Import the signing key of Alejandro Garcia (alejandrogarcia83)
curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import

# Verify the signature of the downloaded binary
gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify Bisq-*.asc
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Install package ====

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg -i Bisq-*.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;

Once this command finishes, Bisq is installed and ready to run.

= How to run =

== From dedicated qube ==

Bisq can be started by running &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;bisq-vm&lt;/code&gt; qube.

== From dom0 ==

To start Bisq directly from dom0, a keyboard shortcut can be defined:

* Q Menu &gt; System Tools &gt; Keyboard &gt; Application Shortcuts
* Add a shortcut where the command has the format &lt;code&gt;qvm-run -q -a &lt;qube-name&gt; &lt;command&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** For example, in our case: &lt;code&gt;qvm-run -q -a bisq-vm /opt/bisq/bin/Bisq&lt;/code&gt;
* Assign a system-wide key combination for starting Bisq
** For example &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Alt+B&lt;/code&gt;
* Press OK

Now pressing the key combination anywhere in QubesOS will automatically start the Bisq application.

= References =

[1] Assuming you only use this Qube for Bisq, this amount of storage will be used for all Bisq files (downloaded installer, installation folder, your local Bisq settings and profile, your Bisq wallet, Bisq logs, etc). Therefore it is important to have enough disk space available, because if Bisq runs out of storage space, this may lead to data corruption and loss of funds. For reference: A fresh Qube containing only a fully sync-ed new installation of Bisq 1.3.6, with no trades / accounts / balances, uses about 1GB of space.

[2] Bisq needs 4 GB, the rest is for other OS processes.

[3] This will ensure that the RAM allocated to this qube is not shared with other Qubes.

[4] For more details, see Verifications section on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/ Bisq GitHub releases page]

[5] The &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/desktop-directories&lt;/code&gt; is not really used, but is required during installation. See [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/848 Issue 848]

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

== Updating Bisq ==

Almost every [[Participating_in_a_DAO_voting_cycle#Background|Cycle]], a new Bisq version is released, with new features and bug fixes. It&amp;#x27;s highly recommended to keep Bisq updated to [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/ last version], as not doing so could lead to bugs and other issues. &lt;br&gt;
Updating Bisq simply requires to install the new version over the existing one. Before updating, it&amp;#x27;s recommended to make a [[Backing up application data|backup]].

{{Admonition_Warn|Do not downgrade Bisq. Installing an older version could cause irreversible damage to Bisq data.}}

== Notification ==

To inform users that a new version is ready and eliminate the need to manually verify the downloaded files, a popup will appear when a new version is released. 
[[File:Updating bisq popup.png|500px|thumb|left]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Clicking on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;download installer and verify signature&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; will download the files needed to install Bisq and will automatically verify that the signatures are correct. &lt;br&gt;
The files to install Bisq should be ready at &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Downloads&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; folder to be [[Downloading_and_installing|installed]].

== Activate pre-release notifications ==

Some users might want to help testing a pre-release version a in real environment. To be notified when a pre-release is ready, go to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Settings&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and activate the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Receive pre-release notifications&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; toggle.

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;use case&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a series of interactions with Bisq [[:Category:Features|features]] in which a user compeletes a particular task. See also [[:Category:Guides|guides]].

Before &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;encrypting your wallet&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, your Bisq wallet files are stored on your machine&amp;#x27;s drive in &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;plain text&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. 

This is not a good idea—anyone who gains access to your computer (whether by physically stealing it or by hacking it remotely) can gain access to your private keys and take your bitcoin.

Setting a password encrypts your Bisq wallet files so they’re useless to anyone without the password.

To set a password, go to &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Wallet Password&lt;/code&gt; and enter a strong password. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do not forget this password, as it cannot be reset.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq will ask for your password every time it starts, so if you do happen to forget it, the only way to open Bisq will be to restore your wallet from seed words.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Restoring application data&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can be useful to bring back payment accounts, onion addresses, and other items from a [[Backing_up_application_data|backup]]—or to move your Bisq instance to an entirely new machine. 

You can restore an entire data directory at once, or just the parts you want.

__TOC__

= Restore an entire data directory =

First make sure Bisq is closed. Then copy the entire &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; directory from your backup and paste it in your machine&amp;#x27;s [[Data_directory#Default_Locations|default data directory location]]. If there already is a directory called &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; there, remove it (or rename it) and replace it with your backup.

Data directories work across operating systems, so you can copy a data directory created on a Mac to the appropriate location on Linux or Windows, and it will work.

Please &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;do not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; run the same data directory on 2 machines at the same time, even if you don&amp;#x27;t run both instances at the same time, as data may get corrupted in strange ways.

= Restore payment accounts =

A [[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_payment_accounts|payment account export]] only contains metadata (name, bank information, etc). For fiat accounts, this means that restoring payment accounts is a 2-step process.

== Restore payment account metadata ==

If you have a payment accounts export file, import it in &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;.

If you don&amp;#x27;t have an export file, but you do have a full backup, you can salvage your payment account metadata from &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/db/UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; by running the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; utility on the &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; file (e.g., run &lt;code&gt;strings /path/to/backup/btc_mainnet/db/UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window). The command will output a simplified version of the &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; file to your terminal. Scroll up a bit and you should see your payment account information.

Use the output to copy and paste the details into new payment accounts in Bisq, paying special attention to make sure each field is copied over with 100% accuracy (including the salt): even a 1 character difference in any field will cause the hash of the payment account to be different, which means aging and signing status will not be restored in the following step.

There are quirks. Here&amp;#x27;s an example of output from a &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; command:

 SEPA
 Alice Liddell
 DE89370400440532013000
 DEUTDE5X*
 SKzH
 salt
 @56655c3738ea9dea3b20f482fff048985a2757e57dff206fbd9e8c4f267f7781

From the output above:
* Be wary of extra characters at the beginning or end of a line. In the example above, the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; character is not part of the BIC &amp;quot;DEUTDE5X&amp;quot;.
* Salts are alphanumeric, so the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; is not part of the salt &amp;quot;56655c3738ea9dea3b20f482fff048985a2757e57dff206fbd9e8c4f267f7781&amp;quot;.

If you&amp;#x27;re on Windows, or cannot use the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; utility for some other reason, you can just open &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; directly in a text editor, but there will be more cruft to sift through since the file isn&amp;#x27;t meant to be human-readable. 

It may be tempting to just replace the entire &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; file from a backup, but this is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not recommended&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, as it may contain other data that could result in data corruption in your new instance.

== Restore payment account aging and signing status ==

Once you&amp;#x27;ve restored your payment account metadata, you&amp;#x27;ll see the accounts in Bisq, but they&amp;#x27;ll have no aging or signing status.

You can get aging and signing status back by replacing &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key&lt;/code&gt; from your backup.
# Make sure you have no active offers, trades or disputes; once you change &lt;code&gt;sig.key&lt;/code&gt;, you will become unreachable.
# Close Bisq. Also make sure you&amp;#x27;ve made a [[Backing_up_application_data|backup of your data directory]] (just in case).
# Replace &lt;code&gt;/path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;sig.key&lt;/code&gt; from your backup.

Upon opening Bisq, you should see account aging and signing status restored for your fiat payment accounts. 

If you don&amp;#x27;t, double-check:
* You copied account metadata and salt correctly [[#Restore_payment_account_metadata|in the previous step]].
* The &lt;code&gt;sig.key&lt;/code&gt; you copied is the correct one (i.e., the one you were using when your accounts accrued aging and/or got signed)

= Restore onion address =

Your onion address determines your [[local reputation]], so depending on your preferences, you may want to reset it or restore it over time.

If you want to restore it:
* Close Bisq. Also make sure you&amp;#x27;ve made a [[Backing_up_application_data|backup of your data directory]] (just in case).
* Replace the &lt;code&gt;/path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservices/&lt;/code&gt; folder with the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservices/&lt;/code&gt; folder from your backup.

When you open Bisq, your onion address will be restored. 

This means that the peers that have traded with you will see [[Local_reputation|bubbles with trade counts]] in their offer books for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;your&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; offers.

= Restore trade history =

You may want to keep your trade history despite changing wallets. You can do so by:
* Closing Bisq.
* Replacing the &lt;code&gt;/path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/db/ClosedTrades&lt;/code&gt; file on your new directory with the file from backup with the same name.

You will see [[Local_reputation|bubbles with trade counts]] in the offer books for any any peers you traded with.

= Restore wallet =

If starting a new data directory, it&amp;#x27;s generally best to just send funds from one Bisq instance to another with an on-chain transaction. Bisq wallets use the bitcoinj library, which causes wallet files to get increasingly larger with every transaction—to the point that wallet file corruption becomes increasingly likely and performance suffers (e.g., long startup times)—so it&amp;#x27;s good to start with a clean wallet every so often.</text></revision></page><page><title>Data directory</title><ns>0</ns><id>31</id><revision><id>2139</id><timestamp>2021-04-08T21:27:33Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is where all of Bisq&amp;#x27;s data files are stored.

It is crucial that you [[Backing_up_application_data|back up this directory]] regularly.

__TOC__

= Data directory structure =

Notable items in the data directory:

* &lt;code&gt;bisq.log&lt;/code&gt; - main log file with most recent logs, often helpful for debugging. This file may contain private information, so it&amp;#x27;s usually not wise to post the whole thing publicly.
* &lt;code&gt;bisq.properties&lt;/code&gt; - place to store [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/common/src/main/java/bisq/common/config/Config.java#L57 command-line options], so you don&amp;#x27;t have to specify them every time you run Bisq (where each option is on a new line in &lt;code&gt;&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&lt;/code&gt; format, e.g., &lt;code&gt;dumpStatistics=true&lt;/code&gt;).
* &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/&lt;/code&gt; - main data directory.
** &lt;code&gt;keys/&lt;/code&gt; - keys for signing P2P messages as well as signing and aging payment accounts.
** &lt;code&gt;db/&lt;/code&gt; - various user data and network data. It is strongly discouraged to edit any files in this directory.
** &lt;code&gt;tor/&lt;/code&gt; - Tor state data. The &lt;code&gt;hiddenservice/&lt;/code&gt; folder within determines your onion address.
** &lt;code&gt;wallet/&lt;/code&gt; - BTC and BSQ wallet files and rolling backups, as well as the &lt;code&gt;bisq.spvchain&lt;/code&gt; file.

Elevated &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;account limits&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; apply to fiat payment accounts in order to limit damage a malicious user can do while allowing honest users to start trading immediately with no KYC and utmost privacy.

Altcoin accounts can trade 0.5 BTC right away, but all fiat payment account types have limits lower than 0.5 BTC to match their particular risk profiles (see [[Payment_methods#Fiat_payment_methods|this table]] for details). Some payment methods with chargeback risk implement a mechanism called &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;account signing&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that restricts trading activity until a trader proves their integrity to further secure against foul play.

To reduce the size of trades entering arbitration Bisq also sets new users trade limits to be 0.1 BTC. This is an additional limit to account limits but users can opt out of this limit at any time.

__TOC__

== Which payment accounts are affected ==

Only fiat payment methods are affected by elevated account limits. Altcoin accounts are only affected by the new user limits which can be opted out if necessary for allow every altcoin account to trade up to 0.5 BTC right away upon creating a payment account in Bisq.

All fiat payment methods in all markets limit total trade size depending on the payment method&amp;#x27;s risk profile (see [[Payment_methods#Fiat_payment_methods|this table]] for details).

Despite these limitations, chargebacks can still be possible for certain payment methods. Bisq reduces this risk with a mechanism called &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;account signing&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Account signing only applies to payment accounts that meet &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of the following conditions:
* used in the following markets: USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, or BRL
* is subject to chargeback risk: SEPA, SEPA Instant, Interac e-Transfer, Zelle, Revolut, Chase QuickPay, Popmoney, MoneyBeam, Uphold, and any kind of bank transfer

This means that all payment accounts that deal in currencies not listed above do &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; require account signing, even if they are subject to chargeback risk.

== Account aging ==

[[File:See-account-age.png|400px|thumb|See account age in the offer book.]]

Account age is no longer used to determine trade size limits for most payment methods. It is still measured, however, and you can see a payment account&amp;#x27;s age in the offer book before taking an offer, but we caution against using it as a measure of integrity. Older accounts are not &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;necessarily&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; safer.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Practically, this means that all payment methods on Bisq have full selling capability from the moment they are created.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Selling limits no longer phase in over time.

Some payment methods implement a variation of account aging called account signing whereby limits are increased in stages over a period of 60 days after signing. More about this below.

If you&amp;#x27;re interested, details on the &lt;code&gt;AccountAgeWitness&lt;/code&gt; object that enables this aging mechanism are [https://docs.bisq.network/payment-account-age-witness.html here].

== Account signing ==

[[File:Account-signing-overview.png|thumb|right|A graphical overview of account signing.]]

Account signing limits &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buying&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; limits of risky fiat payment methods to {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} until the trader has bought bitcoin from a seller with a signed payment account, and then gradually phases in full buying limits. Selling limits are unaffected.

In a nutshell, this is how it works:
* Payment account is created in Bisq for risky payment method
** Buying is limited to {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} BTC per trade until account is signed (see how [[#How_to_get_an_account_signed|below]])
* 30 days after signing, buying limits are increased to 50% of maximum
* 60 days after signing, maximum trade size is allowed

Let&amp;#x27;s see how this works in practice by looking at an example. SEPA has a maximum trade size of 0.0624 BTC, and it requires account signing in order for to enable full trade limits. 

First let&amp;#x27;s observe what happens if a new SEPA account is never signed. Notice how buying limits never increase beyond {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}, but selling 0.0624 BTC is allowed from day 0.

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
! Time Since Creating SEPA Payment Account (Never Signed)
! Maximum Trade Size (Buy) 
! Maximum Trade Size (Sell) 
|-
| Day 0 
| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|-
| Day 30 
| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|-
| Day 60 
| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|-
| Day 90 
| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|}

If that SEPA account manages to get signed on the same day it&amp;#x27;s created, it will see its {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} limit increased on Day 30. Selling limits are unaffected.

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
! Time Since Creating SEPA Payment Account

| 0.0624 BTC 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|-
| Day 90

|}

But if that SEPA account isn&amp;#x27;t signed until Day 30, it won&amp;#x27;t see its limits lifted until Day 60. Again, selling limits are unaffected.

=== How to get an account signed ===

Payment accounts that require signing cannot buy more than {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} until 30 days &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;after&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; they are signed. There&amp;#x27;s two ways to get your account signed.

==== Buying BTC ====
To sign your account you have to buy BTC following these requirements:
* trade amount is greater than or equal to {{MinTradeSizeToBeSigned}} BTC and lesser than or equal to {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}
* offer must be in a market that requires signing (USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, BRL)
* seller&amp;#x27;s account must have been signed for over 30 days at the time of the signing trade

Through taking an offer you can make sure that the offer fulfills the requirements to sign your account. Making an offer could not sign your account, because taker could be unable to sign your account (signed since less than 30 days, or unsigned). 

The Bisq interface makes it easy to determine if an offer can help you get signed: simply &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;look for buy offers with a check mark badge&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;:

[[File:Good-bad-signing-asks.png|600px|thumb|left|Top offer won&amp;#x27;t get you signed. Bottom offer will get you signed.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the image above, the offer on top does not have a check mark, but the offer on the bottom does. And it&amp;#x27;s a valid size (i.e., between {{MinTradeSizeToBeSigned}} BTC and {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}), so taking that offer and successfully completing the trade will result in a signed account.

You can see your payment account&amp;#x27;s limits and signing status at &lt;code&gt;Accounts&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. Pick an account and look toward the bottom:

[[File:Payment-account-signing-status.png|600px|thumb|left|Where to see your payment account&amp;#x27;s limits and signing status.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== With your own signed account ====

Once you have 1 signed payment account, any new payment account you create that requires signing will be self-signed as long as it uses the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;exact same name&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; as your previously signed account. The payment account can be of a different type (e.g. a signed SEPA account can self-sign a SEPA Instant account), but a payment account created with a name that is even slightly different will not be self-signed. 

Payment account types that don&amp;#x27;t require your full name cannot be self-signed (e.g. Revolut, which only requires an email address) and they cannot self-sign other payment accounts.

Self-signed accounts are immediately signed, but limits are not immediately lifted. This is because they have an age of 0 days, so 30 days must pass for the {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} limit to be lifted, and another 30 days must pass for full trading ability to take effect (see tables above).

== Backing up and restoring payment accounts ==

Once your payment accounts have accrued age and been signed, you won&amp;#x27;t want to give them up. With [[Backing_up_application_data|proper backups]], you won&amp;#x27;t have to—payment accounts can be restored if you ever have to remove/reinstall Bisq, move to another machine, etc.

== User opt-out limits ==

To reduce trades into arbitration for new users unfamiliar with Bisq, new users have a 0.1 BTC limit by default that can be opt-out of at any time. 

To access this limit go to Settings &gt; Preferences

[[File:Trade limits.png|frameless|left|Trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or changed at any time]]




Shown above is the trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or edited higher or lower at any time.

If you opt of of this limit you will be given a pop up message informing you...

{{Admonition_Warn|Trading limits are set to reduce risk of costly disputes and losing funds for new users. Raise trading limits at your own risk. Every trader has their own pace, but it&amp;#x27;s recommended to complete at least 5 trades before raising trade limits.

By raising trading limits you acknowledge to be familiar with the basic use of Bisq, like [[Backing_up_application_data|backing up your data]], [[rading_rules|trading rules]], [[Dispute_resolution|dispute resolution]], [[Table_of_penalties|penalties]] and [[User_support|where to find support]].}}

Account signing limits are still applied to buy BTC with most National Account payment methods to reduce chargeback risk.</text></revision></page><page><title>Restoring application data</title><ns>0</ns><id>281</id><revision><id>2040</id><timestamp>2021-01-28T16:15:56Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Restoring application data&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can be useful to bring back payment accounts, onion addresses, and other items from a [[Backing_up_application_data|backup]]—or to move your Bisq instance to an entirely new machine. 

You can restore an entire data directory at once, or just the parts you want.

__TOC__

= Restore an entire data directory =

First make sure Bisq is closed. Then copy the entire &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; directory from your backup and paste it in your machine&amp;#x27;s [[Data_directory#Default_Locations|default data directory location]]. If there already is a directory called &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; there, remove it (or rename it) and replace it with your backup.

Data directories work across operating systems, so you can copy a data directory created on a Mac to the appropriate location on Linux or Windows, and it will work.

Please &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;do not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; run the same data directory on 2 machines at the same time, even if you don&amp;#x27;t run both instances at the same time, as data may get corrupted in strange ways.

= Restore payment accounts =

A [[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_payment_accounts|payment account export]] only contains metadata (name, bank information, etc). For fiat accounts, this means that restoring payment accounts is a 2-step process.

== Restore payment account metadata ==

If you have a payment accounts export file, import it in &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;.

If you don&amp;#x27;t have an export file, but you do have a full backup, you can salvage your payment account metadata from &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/db/UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; by running the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; utility on the &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; file (e.g., run &lt;code&gt;strings /path/to/backup/btc_mainnet/db/UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window). The command will output a simplified version of the &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; file to your terminal. Scroll up a bit and you should see your payment account information.

Use the output to copy and paste the details into new payment accounts in Bisq, paying special attention to make sure each field is copied over with 100% accuracy (including the salt): even a 1 character difference in any field will cause the hash of the payment account to be different, which means aging and signing status will not be restored in the following step.

There are quirks. Here&amp;#x27;s an example of output from a &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; command:

 SEPA
 Alice Liddell
 DE89370400440532013000
 DEUTDE5X*
 SKzH
 salt
 @56655c3738ea9dea3b20f482fff048985a2757e57dff206fbd9e8c4f267f7781

From the output above:
* Be wary of extra characters at the beginning or end of a line. In the example above, the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; character is not part of the BIC &amp;quot;DEUTDE5X&amp;quot;.
* Salts are alphanumeric, so the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; is not part of the salt &amp;quot;56655c3738ea9dea3b20f482fff048985a2757e57dff206fbd9e8c4f267f7781&amp;quot;.

If you&amp;#x27;re on Windows, or cannot use the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; utility for some other reason, you can just open &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; directly in a text editor, but there will be more cruft to sift through since the file isn&amp;#x27;t meant to be human-readable. 

It may be tempting to just replace the entire &lt;code&gt;UserPayload&lt;/code&gt; file from a backup, but this is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not recommended&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, as it may contain other data that could result in data corruption in your new instance.

== Restore payment account aging and signing status ==

Once you&amp;#x27;ve restored your payment account metadata, you&amp;#x27;ll see the accounts in Bisq, but they&amp;#x27;ll have no aging or signing status.

You can get aging and signing status back by replacing &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key&lt;/code&gt; from your backup.
# Make sure you have no active offers, trades or disputes; once you change &lt;code&gt;sig.key&lt;/code&gt;, you will become unreachable.
# Close Bisq. Also make sure you&amp;#x27;ve made a [[Backing_up_application_data|backup of your data directory]] (just in case).
# Replace &lt;code&gt;/path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;sig.key&lt;/code&gt; from your backup.

Upon opening Bisq, you should see account aging and signing status restored for your fiat payment accounts. 

If you don&amp;#x27;t, double-check:
* You copied account metadata and salt correctly [[#Restore_payment_account_metadata|in the previous step]].
* The &lt;code&gt;sig.key&lt;/code&gt; you copied is the correct one (i.e., the one you were using when your accounts accrued aging and/or got signed)

= Restore onion address =

Your onion address determines your [[local reputation]], so depending on your preferences, you may want to reset it or restore it over time.

If you want to restore it:
* Close Bisq. Also make sure you&amp;#x27;ve made a [[Backing_up_application_data|backup of your data directory]] (just in case).
* Replace the &lt;code&gt;/path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservices/&lt;/code&gt; folder with the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservices/&lt;/code&gt; folder from your backup.

When you open Bisq, your onion address will be restored. 

This means that the peers that have traded with you will see [[Local_reputation|bubbles with trade counts]] in their offer books for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;your&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; offers.

= Restore trade history =

You may want to keep your trade history despite changing wallets. You can do so by:
* Closing Bisq.
* Replacing the &lt;code&gt;/path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/db/ClosedTrades&lt;/code&gt; file on your new directory with the file from backup with the same name.

You will see [[Local_reputation|bubbles with trade counts]] in the offer books for any any peers you traded with.

= Restore wallet =

If starting a new data directory, it&amp;#x27;s generally best to just send funds from one Bisq instance to another with an on-chain transaction. Bisq wallets use the bitcoinj library, which causes wallet files to get increasingly larger with every transaction—to the point that wallet file corruption becomes increasingly likely and performance suffers (e.g., long startup times)—so it&amp;#x27;s good to start with a clean wallet every so often.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Export-payment-accounts.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>275</id><revision><id>1271</id><timestamp>2020-05-31T14:40:13Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

Amazon eGift cards are bought on the Amazon website using your account, and sent electronically to the recipient, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the paper vouchers that contain a visible code, and that you can buy at shops for cash. We understand the latter are more private because there is no name attached to the payment, but they also come with risks, namely:
* no payment proof: the seller can claim the code was already spent on receipt, and neither the buyer nor the mediator have any means to ascertain either way
* illicit origin: code vouchers could be obtained through scams, and the recipient account could get the balance erased as a result, and his Amazon account banned
For these reasons, Bisq only allows for eGift cards.

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Buying bitcoin with an Amazon eGift Card ==

=== Step 1. Log in to Amazon ===

First, log in to the Amazon website you&amp;#x27;ll be buying the eGift card on. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;If trading a currency used on multiple Amazon sites (e.g. EUR currency has amazon.de, amazon.it, amazon.es, etc), please confirm with your peer (through trader chat) which site should be used to purchase the gift card.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; You should be able to use your existing Amazon account to log in to any Amazon site (e.g. you can sign in to amazon.de using an account created on amazon.com).

=== Step 2. Customize eGift card ===

It&amp;#x27;s recommended to customize the eGift Card to reduce the chances the gift card is seen as suspicious. Feel free to customize the card design, message, etc. Just remember not to include anything about Bisq or bitcoin anywhere.

* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Amount&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Choose the amount of fiat to send that matches your trade amount. It is recommended to do multiple gift cards of 100 USD or less, as Amazon can consider gift cards of higher amounts to be fraudulent.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Delivery&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Email address or phone number of the seller
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;To&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: eGift recipient information as prompted in the Bisq trade.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Message&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: This should be left blank. If you would like to use anything other than a blank message make sure to use trader chat to confirm it with your trading peer. If not a message has been confirmed please leave  blank.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

[[File:Amazon.png|800px|thumb|left|Customize your gift card.]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

=== Step 3. Make Payment  ===

After your card is ready go, you just have to pay for it! Amazon accepts debit and credit cards, but you cannot pay for an eGift card with another eGift card (or any other Amazon credit balance).

Note: your payment details will NOT be shared with the Seller. The only information they will see is the information you entered to customize the gift card in step 2.

After paying, you&amp;#x27;ll receive an email receipt from Amazon—make sure you keep this email in case of any issues! 

Then make sure you mark your payment as sent in Bisq.

=== Step 4. Seller Gets Notification  ===

Once the buyer sends the gift card, the seller will receive an email or SMS message letting them know about their gift card.

{{Admonition_Note|If the seller didn&amp;#x27;t receive a notification, you can have Amazon send another notification (email or SMS) from the Recent Orders section on Amazon.}}

Upon checking the payment (making sure it&amp;#x27;s the right amount etc), the seller must confirm the payment in Bisq to complete the trade. 

Optionally, the seller can also acknowledge the gift card through Amazon, which would send the buyer an email letting them know the seller has received their gift card.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Both --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Both content --&gt;

Bisq can help users arrange &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;face-to-face&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (F2F) trades to buy and sell bitcoin. 

Done correctly, this may be the only payment method that can be both private &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; anonymous. But there are a number of things you should consider when doing a F2F trade on Bisq. 

F2F trades are &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;technically&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; very similar to online trades. In fact, to carry out a F2F trade, you follow the exact same process within the Bisq software as you would for any other trade. The difference is in how the buyer pays the seller: instead of paying through a financial intermediary (like a bank or other money transfer service), the buyer meets the seller in real life and pays with cash.

__TOC__


= Setting up a F2F account in Bisq =

When setting up a F2F payment account in Bisq, you will be asked to enter the following information:

* Country
* Currency 
* City (this will be displayed with the offer)
* Additional information  (for example where you would like to complete the trade, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;do NOT place direct contact information here!&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;)

You can only select one currency for a single F2F account. If you would like to trade with more than one currency, please create separate accounts for each currency.

Define any special terms, conditions, or details you would like to be displayed with your offers in the &amp;#x27;Additional Information&amp;#x27; field. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Users can see this field &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;before&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; taking the offer by clicking the info icon of the offer.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; 

{{Admonition_Note|Consider setting up separate F2F accounts for buying and selling so you can specify special instructions for each.}}

= Making a F2F offer =

Make sure to state any special terms or conditions in the &amp;#x27;Additional Information&amp;#x27; field of the payment account before making an offer. The person taking the offer will be accepting these terms and conditions by taking the offer. For example you could include that you are looking to complete the trade in a Starbucks within the city center.

Please note it is against Bisq rules to use the &amp;#x27;Additional Information&amp;#x27; field to include advertising offers with a way to contact you prior to the trade (e.g. website, phone, email, or Matrix/Keybase/Telegram user name). Doing this can result in a penalty, should someone take your offer and request for you to be penalized.

= Taking a F2F offer =

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Make sure to check the offer maker&amp;#x27;s terms and conditions before taking a F2F offer.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you cannot fulfill the terms, do not take the the offer. If you have specific terms you would prefer, consider making your own offer instead.

== Meeting your trading partner ==

Doing a transaction face-to-face means you’ll be coming within close proximity of a stranger to exchange relatively substantial value.

=== Be safe ===

People do local, in-person commerce all the time, all over the world. Incidents are rare, but they do happen. You should be cognizant of risks and do your part to minimize potential harm.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Guard your data.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; When you set up a face-to-face payment account in Bisq, you’ll need to provide contact information so you can arrange a meeting with your trading partner. Make sure this information isn’t traceable back to your property or identity.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Meet in a neutral public place.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Meeting your trading partner in a place with witnesses and security cameras significantly reduces the chance of an incident.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Don’t bring more than you need.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Even in a public place, incidents can still happen, but you can limit the chance even further by limiting valuables on your person that would interest a thief in the first place.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bring backup.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Consider bringing a friend with you. Also, depending on the laws in your area &amp;amp; your own comfort, consider carrying a concealed tool for self-defense. Even pepper-spray can hobble a criminal just enough to get you out of immediate danger.

=== Validate payment ===

Face-to-face trades are usually settled with cash. Cash is wonderfully anonymous, but it can be counterfeited. Be sure you know the basics of detecting counterfeit currency. For example, there are several characteristics of US dollar bills one can examine to quickly determine fakes with high accuracy.

You could look for tools like counterfeit pens to do the work for you, but make sure you do thorough research before picking one. Counterfeit pens, for example, are often not reliable.

If you’d rather not take the chance of carrying or accepting cash, consider meeting at a bank where you can validate a buyer’s payment on the spot.

=== Ensure you follow Bisq protocol ===

Ultimately, the deal will be completed in Bisq. Buyers must mark payment as sent before sellers can release assets.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Buyers&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; should bring a laptop with them so they can mark the payment as sent. Otherwise, the buyer will end up paying the seller and have to walk away without the bitcoin they paid for (since the seller won’t be able to acknowledge receipt of payment before the buyer acknowledges they sent payment).

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Sellers&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; should bring a laptop with their Bisq client running no matter what. Once they receive a legitimate payment, they’ll need to mark the payment as received so the assets are released to the buyer. No buyer will want to walk away after paying without proof of a complete deal.

== Disputes ==

The lack of verifiable actions makes handling face-to-face disputes much harder.

This is why we highly recommend that both parties bring laptops and acknowledge their ends of the deal on the spot.

Otherwise, the same dispute process is in place for F2F trades, but be advised that mediators and arbitrators often won’t have a way to settle disputes. In such cases, aggrieved traders can send deposit funds arbitration and [[Making_a_reimbursement_request|make an appeal to the Bisq DAO]].

Having said that, mediators and arbitrators may attempt different tactics to get a handle on the situation.</text></revision></page><page><title>Faster Payments</title><ns>0</ns><id>156</id><revision><id>3912</id><timestamp>2025-02-12T02:17:43Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;SWIFT&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (international wire transfer) is a network that allows financial institutions worldwide to send and receive payments internationally in multiple currencies.

Sender and receiver typically incur fees and payment times can also be slow (up to 7 days), but payments are secure and almost completely irreversible. 

See [[Payment_methods#Fiat_payment_methods|this table]] for up-to-date trade limits and [[Account_limits#Account_signing|signing requirements]].

== Background ==

Almost all banks have access to the SWIFT network. Some money transfer services also give users access to the SWIFT Network. 

In order to set up a SWIFT payment account in Bisq, you will need:
* BIC/SWIFT code 
* IBAN code

Also ensure that you are aware of:
* bank fees for sending and receiving SWIFT payments
* which currencies you can accept
* what the exchange rate would be in case conversion is necessary

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Policies vary by bank, and sometimes conversion fees are charged unexpectedly, so make sure you are aware of your bank&amp;#x27;s policies beforehand.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

== Setting up the payment account ==

When [[Creating_a_payment_account#Creating_a_national_currency_account|creating a new payment account]] for SWIFT, keep the following in mind: 
* Traders using SWIFT on Bisq could be anywhere in the world, so please fill all fields completely and accurately
* If you are not comfortable sharing your own address, provide the address of your bank

{{Admonition_Note|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;By default, Bisq sets up your SWIFT account to make and take offers from any country and any currency.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; This means SWIFT accounts on Bisq are able to trade on ALL fiat currency markets. The currency for a particular trade will always be specified by the maker in their offer.}}

Note: if you transact in a currency that is not native to your bank account (as either maker OR taker), your bank may make you pay currency exchange fees. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;It is your responsibility to cover these fees.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Please make 100% sure you&amp;#x27;re aware of what to expect before making or taking an offer.

== Notes on buying BTC ==

You can buy BTC with SWIFT on Bisq in 2 waysː

# Make an offer to buy BTC on a currency market of your choosing
# Take an offer to buy BTC on the currency market specified in the offer

=== Send payment in correct currency ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;The bitcoin buyer must send payment in the currency of the market on which the offer was made.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; For example, if you make an offer to buy BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/USD market you should send USD (or ensure your bank converts your local currency into USD). Alternatively, if you take an offer to buy BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/EUR market you must send EUR.

Failure to send payment in the correct currency will result in a penalty for the BTC buyer of either (1) 5% of the trade amount or (2) the amount the receiver is missing in the specified currency as a result of the currency exchange (whichever is greater).

=== Put an appropriate reason for payment ===

In general, [[Trading_rules#Leave_the_.22reason_for_payment.22_field_empty|the reason for payment field should be left blank]].

Some users have reported instances in which an intermediary bank converts a payment&amp;#x27;s currency to the their own currency before converting back to the destination bank&amp;#x27;s local currency, and taking fees for doing this.

If you don&amp;#x27;t want this to happen, consider making the SWIFT sender put &amp;quot;DO NOT CONVERT&amp;quot; in the comment field for the wire transfer (not the comment field of the Bisq payment account). This will only work if the recipient is able to handle multi-currency incoming SWIFT payments.

=== Use the correct fee option ===

SWIFT transfers for Bisq trades should use the SHA (SHAred) fee option. [[#Understanding_SWIFT_fees|More on this below]].

== Notes on selling BTC ==

You can sell BTC with SWIFT on Bisq in 2 waysː

# Make an offer to sell BTC on a currency market of your choosing
# Take an offer to sell BTC on the currency market specified in the offer

The BTC seller should receive the funds in the currency specified in the offer. For example, if you &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;make&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; an offer to sell BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/USD market, you will receive USD. Alternatively if you &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;take&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; an offer to sell BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/EUR market, you will receive EUR.

Since SWIFT senders must use the SHA (SHAred) fee option for Bisq trades, sellers may incur fees on their end ([[#Understanding_SWIFT_fees|see more below]]). Make sure you are aware of these fees before selling BTC using SWIFT.

== Understanding SWIFT fees ==

When sending a SWIFT transfer the sender has three fee options to choose from:

* BEN (BENeficiary) – payee (recipient of the payment) incurs all payment transaction fees. Typically, the recipient receives the payment minus the transaction fees. The payer (sender of the payment) does not pay any transaction fees.
* OUR – payer (sender of the payment) incurs all payment transaction fees. Normally you are billed separately for the payment transfer. The payee (recipient of the payment) does not pay any transaction fees. The beneficiary receives the full payment amount.
* SHA (SHAred) – payer (sender of the payment) pays all fees charged by the sending bank, which are billed separately. The payee (recipient of the payment) pays all fees charged by their receiving bank. The recipient receives the payment minus any applicable fees.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bisq requires buyers to use the SHA (SHAred) fee option for SWIFT transfers.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If a BTC buyer sends a payment using the BEN (BENeficiary) fee option, they will likely incur a penalty to compensate the BTC seller.

Please make sure you are aware of your bank&amp;#x27;s fee schedule for the SHA (SHAred) fee option. Normally it will be $5-25 USD equivalent, but every bank is different.</text></revision></page><page><title>Tikkie</title><ns>0</ns><id>506</id><revision><id>3903</id><timestamp>2025-01-31T02:03:58Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

To buy and sell bitcoin using US Postal Money orders, you will need to [[Create_a_payment_account|set up a corresponding payment account]] in Bisq.

Things to keep in mind:
* It is okay to use a fake name and address in a USPMO account on Bisq &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;only if using the account will be used to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This is because a USPMO is a bearer instrument—as long as the money order itself is valid, it doesn&amp;#x27;t matter who sent it or what the sender&amp;#x27;s address is.
** Consider using an online name generator (search &amp;quot;random name generator&amp;quot; on your favorite search engine) for a more bias-free suggestion for the sender&amp;#x27;s name.
** For the sender&amp;#x27;s address, you may want to be more careful, because if your envelope is returned, you&amp;#x27;ll want to be able to retrieve it.
*** &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Option 1&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Use an actual fake address (search internet for &amp;quot;random address generator&amp;quot;). If your envelope is returned for any reason, you&amp;#x27;ll probably lose it for good.
*** &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Option 2&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Use another address: that of a neighbor, a friend, or a nearby building (e.g., apartment leasing office, local mom-and-pop shop, etc). This way, you&amp;#x27;ll have a higher chance of retrieving a returned envelope, but you&amp;#x27;ll reveal a bit of information about your location.
* If selling, name and address must be correct (address must be correct in order to receive the envelope, and name must match photo ID to cash it).
* To maximize privacy, consider setting up 2 separate payment accounts: one with fake information for buying bitcoin and one with real information for selling bitcoin.

Again, please note that incorrect information in Bisq payment accounts is generally against Bisq trade protocol. Buying bitcoin with USPMO is a rare exception.

{{Admonition_Note | Trading using US Postal Money Orders (USPMO) on Bisq requires that you understand the following:

* BTC buyers must write the BTC Seller’s name in both the Payer and the Payee’s fields &amp;amp; take a high-resolution photo of the USPMO and envelope with proof of tracking before sending.
* BTC buyers must send the USPMO to the BTC seller with Delivery Confirmation.

In the event mediation is necessary, or if there is a trade dispute, you will be required to send the photos to the Bisq mediator or refund agent, together with the USPMO Serial Number, Post Office Number, and dollar amount, so they can verify the details on the US Post Office website.

Failure to provide the required information to the Mediator or Arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case.

In all dispute cases, the USPMO sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in providing evidence/proof to the Mediator or Arbitrator.

If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade using USPMO on Bisq.}}

= Buying the money order =

It is highly recommended to use cash to buy the USPMO. Using any other electronic form of payment adds a form of tracking to the transaction, which can defeat the purpose of using the USPMO in the first place.

If you&amp;#x27;re not buying more than $3,000 of money orders in a single day, the [https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/509.htm#ep1124357 USPS does not require photo ID]. If asked for ID, kindly remind your cashier that ID isn&amp;#x27;t required (perhaps you left it at home?).

Also consider:
* asking for a printed receipt, in case of a dispute on Bisq
* wearing sunglasses and/or a mask
* placing the USPMO out of sight upon receiving it, and filling it out elsewhere (away from cameras)

= Sending a money order in the mail =

[[File:Uspsmo-4.png|400px|thumb|right|Figure 1. Extra paper for extra privacy in the envelope.]]

Address the envelope as appropriate. 

When putting the money order in the envelope, consider adding a blank sheet of paper for an additional layer of privacy. Fold a blank sheet of paper in half twice (to form a “V” shape). Place the folded sheet in the envelope with the opening facing up. In between the “V” opening, place the USPMO (see Figure 1). This extra layer of paper makes it harder to see the envelope&amp;#x27;s contents from the outside.

After dropping your money order in the mail, don&amp;#x27;t forget to mark your payment as sent in Bisq!

= Redeeming a money order =

== For cash ==

In order to redeem a money order for cash, you&amp;#x27;ll need to present photo identification that matches the name on the USPMO. 

Keep in mind that the cash you can receive may be limited to the amount of cash the cashier has in their drawer—to receive larger quantities of cash, you may need to go to different locations or go back at different times.

One user has reported a workaround involving spreading the transaction to other counters at the post office:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first time I visited the Post Office to &amp;quot;cash out&amp;quot; my money order someone sent me in Bisq, I think it was for the amount of $1,000 USD. The Teller told me she doesn&amp;#x27;t have that much money to help me redeem it. But then, instead of sending me away to my bank to deposit it there, she called out to her co-workers down the line, asking each of them how much each currently had in their drawer. Whereas she had (I forget the exact amounts now) maybe $200 in her drawer, the neighboring teller said she had $300 and the next Teller over said he had about $700. So, my Teller took my $1,000 money order, gave me the $200 in her drawer, printed me a new money order for the difference of $800, and sent me to see the next Teller. Then, that 2nd Teller accepted my $800 money order, gave me her $300 in her drawer, and printed me the difference of $500 as a new money order. Finally, the 3rd Teller used the $700 in his drawer to fully redeem my $500 money order. I had to hop three Tellers, one after another, paying the fee for each money order printed along the way, but I walked out of the Post Office with $1,000 cash in that one visit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== For new USPMOs ==

Another option is to redeem the USPMO you receive for another USPMO. Some cashiers will claim this isn&amp;#x27;t possible, but it is. Gently call a manager or colleague to help in case your cashier doesn&amp;#x27;t cooperate.

Why redeem a USPMO for another USPMO? Because a USPMO is almost as good as cash—you can mail USPMO to billers to pay bills (without banks!), for example.</text></revision></page><page><title>UPI</title><ns>0</ns><id>508</id><revision><id>3614</id><timestamp>2024-06-16T18:34:02Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Wise&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, formally TransferWise, was added as a distinct payment method to Bisq in v1.5.0. 

Wise can be used in SEPA trades as well, where one peer uses SEPA and another uses TransferWise. This article discusses Wise-to-Wise trades, where both peers use Wise.

Wise is a web- and app-based money transfer service that supports multiple currencies. Wise to Wise payments allow users to send payment from any supported currency to any other supported currency. Payments utilize the Wise multi-currency account. This is available for users in most countries.

== Setting up a Wise Account ==

Set up an account. Go to [https://wise.com/ Wise] and register for an account. KYC will be required.

== Setting up a Wise Account in Bisq ==

Go to &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt;  &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt; in Bisq and select &lt;code&gt;Add New Account&lt;/code&gt;.

Enter the email address you have registered with TransferWise and the currencies you would like to make and take offers with.

== Getting your Wise account ready for trading ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;This section is primarily for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BTC sellers&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; using Wise.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

You can set up your account on the mobile app or on the web site. Screenshots are from the website.

On the left click &amp;#x27;open a balance&amp;#x27;. Choose the currency you would like to trade in and select Confirm. You can add as many currencies as you wish.

The following currencies all come with local bank details as part of your Wise account (may differ depending on locations):

* AUD
* EUR
* GBP
* NZD
* RON
* SGD
* USD

If you are selling Bitcoin on Bisq these accounts are useful as they allow you to trade with those currencies as they give you a recipient bank account that can be used to receive funds from the Buyer of Bitcoin

Click on recipients. This is where you set up where you want the money paid to.

Click &amp;#x27;Add your bank account&amp;#x27; and enter your bank account details (these can be your own bank details, or they can be the Wise local bank account details you have created).

Once added click the down arrow next to the account and select &amp;#x27;[https://wise.com/help/articles/2932129/nominating-a-primary-account make primary]&amp;#x27;. This means when someone pays you via Wise to Wise it will go into your primary bank account.

NB: You need to have a primary bank account set up for each currency you wish to receive funds to on Wise. If you do not have a payment account set up the trader might not be able to send payment to you. If they are able payment will appear in your Wise balance for this currency.

== Making payments with Wise ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;This section is primarily for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BTC buyers&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; using Wise.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Because of the way Wise payments are implemented in the Bisq trade protocol, the only information sellers have about buyers is their email address.

Wise has a useful guide about this [https://wise.com/help/articles/2932105/can-i-send-money-to-someone-with-only-their-email-address in their help section].

To set up a transfer to an email address, follow these steps:

# Start a transfer by clicking the Send money button
# At the recipient step, choose Someone else or Business or charity
# Untick the box next to I know their bank details
# Enter your recipient’s email and full name
# Pay for the transfer as usual

You can then choose how you would like to pay. You can even pay by credit or debit card!

On the case that the payment was made with a name different from the email address (which is allowed) and could create some confusion, the receiver could verify that the name of the btc buyer is correct by writing his email on a new payment and see if the name matches the one he received it from. *Of course do not go through resending them any funds, there is no need in order to verify the name.</text></revision></page><page><title>Wise-USD</title><ns>0</ns><id>507</id><revision><id>3900</id><timestamp>2025-01-31T01:51:54Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

The mediator may ask the seller to send them information to prove their account details are correct, or in the case of the BTC Buyer making a payment late, or of the wrong amount.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Zelle&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a popular payment method that can be used to buy and sell bitcoin for USD. It is offered by many banks and credit unions in the United States (US). Zelle payments are typically instant, but they can take up to 4 days to process in some cases.

== What is Zelle? ==
Zelle is a convenient way to send and receive money through your bank or credit union’s mobile app or online banking. All you need is your recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number, and money will be available to use in minutes if they’re already enrolled with Zelle. Your account information and activity stay private. Zelle is available in over 2,200 bank and credit union apps.

More information is available on Zelle&amp;#x27;s website: [https://www.zellepay.com/faq/top-zelle-questions]

== The Standalone Zelle App ==
In addition to Zelle being available directly from banks and credit unions, there is also a Zelle standalone app available for those whose banks do not offer Zelle. On April 1, 2025, the standalone Zelle app will no longer be available. Current users of the standalone app will need to register with a bank or credit union that offers Zelle to continue using the service. Users of the standalone app that do not register with a supported bank or credit union will not be able to use the service after April 1, 2025.

== What counties is Zelle available in? ==
Zelle is only available in the United States.  

== What currencies can I use with Zelle? ==
Zelle is used for transferring USD.   

== Are there spending limits with Zelle? ==
Zelle does not have a universal standard in regards to spending limits. Each bank will have different policies when setting daily, weekly, and monthly spending limits. Limits are typically displayed within the Zelle app, and it&amp;#x27;s the buyer&amp;#x27;s responsibility to check their spending limits before taking an offer to buy bitcoin.

== What is the maximum trading duration for Zelle? ==
The maximum time for Zelle trade is 4 days.  Most Zelle payments arriving instantly, but policies vary depending on the user&amp;#x27;s bank.  

== What is the maximum BTC limit for a Zelle trade? ==
{{MaxTradeSizeBisq1}} is the maximum amount per trade.

== Does the Zelle payment method require account signing in Bisq? ==
Yes.  Trades are limited to 0.01 BTC until the payment account is [[Account_limits|signed]].

== How do I setup a Zelle account ==
Zelle is normally an option from within your mobile banking app.  First time users will normally need to verify their email or phone number to get started.  

== How do I create a Zelle payment account in Bisq? ==
# Click &amp;#x27;Account&amp;#x27;
# Click &amp;#x27;Add New Account&amp;#x27;
# Select &amp;#x27;Zelle (ClearXchange) from the dropdown list
# Fill in the account owner&amp;#x27;s full name.  
{{Admonition_Warn|It&amp;#x27;s important to use your real information, as it&amp;#x27;s registered with your bank.  Per Bisq trade rules, sellers can not confirm payment receipt unless the sender&amp;#x27;s account name matches what&amp;#x27;s listed in Bisq.}}
# Fill in your email address or phone number that is registered with Zelle.  
# Optionally, you can select to use a custom account name that will only be visible to you.  This helps identify multiple Zelle payment accounts.  
# Click &amp;#x27;Save New Account&amp;#x27;

== How do I buy BTC with my Zelle account? ==
# Make an offer to buy BTC in the USD market.
# Take an offer to buy BTC in the USD market.

Once a trade is started and the deposit transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you will see the seller&amp;#x27;s full name and either their email address or phone number.  Next, login to your bank&amp;#x27;s mobile banking app and follow the instructions to send the Zelle payment.  {{Admonition_Warn|Per Bisq trade rules you can only use the information provided on the Bisq trade screen.}}. Once payment has been sent and confirmed click the &amp;#x27;Payment Started&amp;#x27; button on the trade screen.

== How do I sell BTC with my Zelle account? ==
# Make an offer to sell BTC in the USD market
# Take an offer to sell BTC in the USD market.  

Once a trade is started and the deposit transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the buyer will be instructed to send payment to the Zelle account information that you have provided.  Once they confirm that payment has been sent you will see an option on the trade screen to confirm that you have received the payment.  Once you have confirmed the correct amount has been sent from the account that is listed on the Bisq trade screen, you can click to confirm payment.  {{Admonition_Warn|Per Bisq trade rules the buyer can only confirm a payment if the sender&amp;#x27;s name match&amp;#x27;s what&amp;#x27;s displayed in Bisq.}}

== Are there any fees for me to be aware of when using my Zelle account? ==
Zelle is free of charge.  

== How does dispute resolution when trading with Zelle? ==
If a dispute arises, the mediator may request the buyer to provide evidence that they have made the payment of the correct amount to the BTC Seller within the specified timeframe. The mediator may also request the seller to provide information to verify their account details, or in the case of the BTC Buyer making a payment late or of the wrong amount.  For more information see [[dispute resolution]].

== What happens if my bank doesn&amp;#x27;t allow me to send a Zelle Payment ==
Each bank or credit union can set their own risk factors for their customers when it comes to sending payments. If, for any reason, you&amp;#x27;re unable to send a payment to the account listed on the trade screen, then you should manually open a support ticket (hit Ctrl + O while the trade is selected) and notify the mediator about your banking issue.</text></revision></page><page><title>L-BTC</title><ns>0</ns><id>454</id><revision><id>2162</id><timestamp>2021-04-16T20:31:28Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Altcoins&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are a type of [[Payment_methods|payment account]] on Bisq that use cryptocurrencies to settle BTC trades instead of legacy fiat-based payment methods.

Any altcoin can be traded on Bisq, theoretically, but the most active markets tend to be XMR, ETH, LTC (and of course [[BSQ]], but &amp;quot;altcoin&amp;quot; may not be a great term for it).

{{Admonition_Warn|There is currently an [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/166 indefinite hold] on adding new altcoins to Bisq.}}

Some altcoins have special, specific requirements for trading. Make sure you read the in-application pop-ups and information, as well as the following articles:
* [[Trading BSQ]]
* [[Trading Monero]]
* [[Trading L-BTC]]

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Altcoins Instant&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a type of [[Payment_methods|payment account]] on Bisq that uses cryptocurrencies to settle BTC trades &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;within 1 hour&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;—meaning the buyer must send payment and the seller must acknowledge it within 1 hour.

Ordinary Altcoins accounts have a trade period of 1 day. Altcoins Instant payment accounts are identical to ordinary [[Altcoins]] payment accounts in every other way aside from their trade period.

Only use this payment method for making or taking offers if you know you&amp;#x27;ll on your machine while the offer is available. Disable it other times to avoid disputes.

See [[Creating_a_payment_account#Creating_an_altcoin_account|how to create an Altcoins Instant payment account]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Creating a payment account</title><ns>0</ns><id>70</id><revision><id>2166</id><timestamp>2021-04-16T22:06:46Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Payment accounts&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; indicate the method by which Bisq trades are to be settled. You must create a national currency account to trade bitcoin for national currencies or an altcoin account to trade altcoins for bitcoin.

__TOC__

== Creating a national currency account == 

Before creating a national currency account, notice that we cannot take any offers. The buttons to take offers are disabled, and if we try to click any of them, Bisq will tell us we need to create a payment account first.

[[File:BuyBitcoinscreen.png|thumb|left|500px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

You can create a new national currency account in &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. Pick the payment account type from the drop-down and fill out the form. For more details on the various payment methods Bisq offers, see [[Payment methods]].

Bisq will ask you for information required to set up the account in Bisq. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Recall that all the information you put in here is stored locally&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, and only sent to your trading peer upon confirmation of the trade&amp;#x27;s deposit transaction. This is a stark contrast to typical exchange KYC, where personal information is stored in a central database honeypot indefinitely for various forms of harassment and surveillance.

{{Admonition_Warn|Make sure all information you put in your payment account is correct, such that it matches what the other trader will see on their bank statement. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do NOT use fake names or initials.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Doing so is a violation of [[Trading_rules#Do_not_confirm_payments_with_mismatching_details|trading rules]].

Also: once you’ve created an account, you cannot edit its details (if you need to make a change, you’ll have to delete and add the account again). So make sure everything is correct the first time!}}

[[File:Accountsetup.png|thumb|left|500px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

You don’t need to edit the Salt field. Account name is a label you can set to make it easier to distinguish between other payment accounts you set up; only you will ever see, so there’s no right or wrong value for it.

Once you&amp;#x27;re done, click &lt;code&gt;Save New Account&lt;/code&gt;. Go back to the &lt;code&gt;Buy BTC&lt;/code&gt; screen and you&amp;#x27;ll see that offers requiring the payment method you just configured will now be enabled:

[[File:BuyBTC-accountenabled.png|thumb|left|500px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

=== Notes ===

If there are no offers in the payment method you prefer, don&amp;#x27;t hesitate to make your own offer. New Bisq peers come online all the time, and it only takes 2 to trade. Also, offer makers pay a lot less in fees!

== Creating an altcoin account ==

Creating an altcoin account is largely the same as creating a national currency account, but even simpler. 

Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Altcoin Accounts&lt;/code&gt;, click &lt;code&gt;Add New Account&lt;/code&gt;, pick the altcoin you&amp;#x27;d like to trade in the drop-down, and fill out the form.

=== Special requirements ===

Some altcoins have specific requirements. Monero, for example, requires that sellers be able to provide a transaction key in case of a dispute, which is not available in all XMR wallets. L-BTC buyers must use a wallet that shows the blinding key. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Make sure to read any pop-ups carefully to make sure your trades go as smoothly as possible.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=== Instant accounts ===

By default, all altcoins trades on Bisq have trade periods of 1 day, but you can set up an Altcoins Instant account on Bisq for 1-hour trade periods. Just check the box in the payment account creation process. 

[[File:Altcoin-instant-setup.png|500px|thumb|left|Check this box to set up an Altcoins Instant account.]]

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;feature&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a distinct aspect of the Bisq client software that provides the user with information or allows the user to take one or more specific actions. See also [[:Category:Use Cases|use cases]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; colored bitcoin tokens are the unit of account for the Bisq DAO. The easier way to get BSQ is [[BSQ_swaps|swapping]] it for BSQ at Bisq.

__TOC__

== BSQ Token ==

{{BSQ_Token_Intro}}

=== BSQ v BTC ===

You can see how the characteristics of a BSQ transaction differ by viewing them side-by-side on a BTC explorer and a BSQ explorer:
* [https://mempool.space/tx/0243f99c848de4f53cb29157d10bf1cdbfcf4219f84e9997dd3cac9244ab7242 txid 0243f99c848de4f53cb29157d10bf1cdbfcf4219f84e9997dd3cac9244ab7242 on a BTC block explorer]
* [https://mempool.space/bisq/tx/0243f99c848de4f53cb29157d10bf1cdbfcf4219f84e9997dd3cac9244ab7242 txid 0243f99c848de4f53cb29157d10bf1cdbfcf4219f84e9997dd3cac9244ab7242 on a BSQ block explorer]

=== BSQ Trading ===

Because BSQ tokens are only recognized by Bisq software, BSQ trading can only take place in Bisq software.

While BSQ is just bitcoin, it should only be stored in a Bisq wallet.

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please do not try to send BSQ to a non-Bisq wallet&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, or to otherwise create your own BSQ transactions. The rules to form a valid BSQ transaction are rather complex, and even the slightest error can result in invalid BSQ. Even the [[DAO_technical_overview|technical overview]] does not cover every single detail—the only complete reference is the source code. Also note that future code changes may break custom transactions or implementations. 

Bisq will NOT provide support for any such cases.}}

=== BSQ Issuance ===

After the genesis transaction in April 2019, BSQ can only be created through an issuance transaction (compensation request or reimbursement request). See more on BSQ&amp;#x27;s [[Introduction_to_the_DAO#Overview|issuance and burn dynamic]].

{{Admonition_Note|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;The BSQ token is not associated with any kind of initial coin offering (ICO) or capital-raising initiative.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; It’s merely a tool to decentralize the governance of the already-functional Bisq exchange network, which has been operating in production since April 2016.}}

== BSQ Wallet ==

BSQ is stored in a Bitcoin wallet, but the Bisq software takes several measures to keep BSQ and BTC separate to prevent mixing the two by accident. On disk, BTC and BSQ wallets are stored in separate files. In the Bisq interface, BSQ wallets are prefixed with a &amp;#x27;B&amp;#x27; to prevent users from mistakenly using BSQ as BTC.

As an additional protection measure, Bisq wallets use a special BIP-44 [[Restoring_your_wallet_from_seed#Restoring_to_a_non-Bisq_wallet|derivation path]] that other wallets won’t understand.

For user convenience, the built-in Bisq wallets for BTC and BSQ share the same seed.

More details are in the [[DAO user reference]] and [[DAO technical overview]]. Also see how to [[buy BSQ]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Paying trade fees with BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; enables traders to get a 50% discount on trading fees while compensating Bisq contributors.

This article explains how to get BSQ and use it to pay for trading fees.

__TOC__

== Background ==

Bisq&amp;#x27;s BSQ colored bitcoin token is different from most other exchange tokens: the primary reason it exists is to enable the decentralized operation and management of the Bisq network. That means no central wallets or accounts to accumulate funds, and no legal entity or leadership team to control strategy.

For traders, BSQ offers discounted trading fees. This article covers how to buy BSQ and use it to get a discount on trading fees.

== Acquire BSQ ==

Although BSQ is [[BSQ technically bitcoin]], it’s [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins colored bitcoin] that must be kept in a Bisq wallet, separate from plain bitcoin.

To help you do this, and to avoid mistakes, Bisq automatically generates a separate BSQ wallet with addresses prefixed with a &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;—so you can be sure when you’re sending or receiving from a BSQ address.

=== Retrieve your BSQ address ===

You can find your BSQ wallet address in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;BSQ wallet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Receive&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Bsq-wallet-address.png|700px|thumb|left|Get your BSQ address.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Create BSQ payment account ===

To trade BSQ on Bisq, you need to set up an altcoin account using your BSQ address. If you&amp;#x27;re curious about Instant trades, check out [[Altcoins_Instant this article]].

[[File:Add-new-bsq-account.png|700px|thumb|left|Use your BSQ address to create a BSQ payment account.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Make or take a BSQ offer ===

Once you have a BSQ payment account set up, you can buy and sell BSQ.

Pick an offer you like (or make an offer of your own) and complete the trade.

[[File:Bsq-buy-offers.png|700px|thumb|left|Browse offers to buy BSQ.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Use BSQ to pay trading fees ==

Once you’ve got some BSQ, you can use it to pay trading fees.

When you get to the &lt;code&gt;Take offer&lt;/code&gt; screen where you confirm the trade amount, you’ll see a toggle for trading fees where you can select between BTC and BSQ trading fees.

[[File:trading-fee-toggle.png|700px|thumb|left|Pick BSQ to pay trading fees on the make-offer or take-offer screen.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Pick the option you like better and complete the trade!

{{Admonition Note|[[Trading_fees|Using BSQ to pay trading fees]] is about 50% cheaper then using plan bitcoin, and it also helps pay contributors for their work!}}

== Beyond trading fees ==

BSQ is also a core element of Bisq’s governance mechanism, allowing stakeholders (contributors, traders, and anyone else who uses or helps the project) to have a hand in crafting the strategy of the project through a voting process.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Proposals&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are a way to suggest significant &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;project-wide&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; changes or new initiatives where a broad consensus of contributors, users, and stakeholders is desired. Smaller changes to existing components, infrastructure, or processes are generally best discussed in other channels (on Matrix, other GitHub repositories, etc).

This article covers the roles, processes, and conventions for proposals.

__TOC__

== Roles ==

* [[Proposals Maintainer]]

== Processes ==

Anyone may submit new proposals and/or review other proposals. But there are things you can do to make it more likely your ideas are received well.

=== Submission and Review ===

==== Research and Evaluate ====

Proposals are supposed to be significant items with enough weight to draw attention from core contributors, users, and stakeholders from across functions.

{{Admonition_Note|If your idea is focused on a particular area of Bisq, it would be best to first float your idea in the channels for that area. For example, development-related ideas can be discussed in #dev on Matrix or in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq the main GitHub repository]. Growth-related ideas can be discussed in #growth on Matrix or the [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/ growth GitHub repository].}}

Accordingly, proposals should be well-considered, well-researched, and well-articulated.

As a result, before submitting a proposal, please:
# Discuss your idea with other contributors to see if a proposal is worth submitting at all
# Search through existing proposals (both [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues open and closed]) to see whether something similar has already been proposed
# Notice which among those proposals have been accepted and rejected, and why
# Read this article to fully understand the proposal process and guidelines

Look through past proposals that succeeded to get a feel for how they were structured.

==== Create GitHub Issue ====

Once you&amp;#x27;ve done research, floated your idea in the community in other channels, and think your idea might garner broader support, create a new GitHub issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues|bisq-network/proposals repository on GitHub], written and formatted according to the following guidelines:

* Write your proposal in a way that makes it as easy as possible to achieve rough consensus. This means that proposals should be as simple, focused, concrete and well-defined as possible. Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your fellow contributors to understand and agree with you.
* Take full responsibility for your proposal. It is not the maintainers&amp;#x27; job, nor anyone else’s, to see your proposal succeed. If people aren’t responding or reacting to your proposal, it’s your job to solicit that feedback more actively.
* Never assume that anyone other than yourself is going to do the work described in your proposal. If your proposal does place expectations on other contributors, or requires them to change their behavior in any way, be explicit about that.
* Provide context. Make a strong case for your proposal. Link to prior discussions. Do not make your reader do any more work than they have to to understand your proposal.
* Format your proposal well. Make it a pleasure to read.

In general, good proposals take time to research and write. Every minute you spend clearly and logically articulating your proposal is a minute that you save other contributors in understanding it. This diligence on your part will be appreciated and rewarded by others&amp;#x27; attention. 

{{Admonition_Warn|Cheaply-written, &amp;quot;drive by&amp;quot; proposals that waste others&amp;#x27; time will be closed immediately as &lt;code&gt;was:incorrect&lt;/code&gt;.}}

A [[Proposals_maintainer|maintainer]] will quickly review your proposal and will either (a) assign it to you to indicate your ownership and responsibility over it, or (b) close it and label it as &lt;code&gt;was:incorrect&lt;/code&gt; if it does not follow the guidelines listed above.

==== Review ====

Once a proposal is submitted, a two-week review period follows. 

During this period, interested reviewers should read, discuss and ultimately [https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments react] to the proposal as follows:
* 👍: I agree with the proposal and want to see it enacted.
* 😕: I am uncertain about the proposal and I need more information.
* 👎: I disagree with the proposal and do not want to see it enacted.

Try to provide an explanation of your reaction, especially when reacting with a 😕 or 👎. If you don’t, then don’t expect your opinion to have much weight or get addressed.

If you do not understand or care about a given proposal, ignore it.

Use comments on the proposal issue to discuss, ask questions, and get clarifications. Take lengthy discussions offline to Matrix or elsewhere and then summarize them back on the issue.

==== Evaluate ====

The proposal review process is all about reaching a rough consensus, meaning that there is a broad agreement that the proposal should be enacted, and that any dissenting opinions have been addressed, though not necessarily fully resolved.

After the two-week review period is over, a maintainer will evaluate reactions to and discussions about the proposal and will close the issue with a comment explaining that it is approved or rejected based on whether a rough consensus was achieved.

Approved proposals will be labeled with &lt;code&gt;was:approved&lt;/code&gt;. Rejected proposals will be labeled with &lt;code&gt;was:rejected&lt;/code&gt;.

If rough consensus has not been achieved, e.g. because discussion is still ongoing, dissenting concerns have not been addressed, or the proposal has turned out to be contentious, the maintainer will indicate that they cannot close the proposal, and that it is up to the submitter to take next steps to move the proposal forward. One option is to [[#Submit_to_the_DAO|submit the proposal to the DAO]] for voting. If the proposal does not move forward after another two weeks, the maintainer will close and label it &lt;code&gt;was:stalled&lt;/code&gt;.

If there have been no or very few reactions to a proposal after the two-week period, the maintainer will close it and label it as &lt;code&gt;was:ignored&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;!-- was:moved--&gt;

==== Enact ====

Assuming your proposal was approved, the next step is to actually enact the changes described in that proposal, perhaps by [[Project_management|creating a project]] or simply getting to work.

=== Submit to the DAO (if needed) ===

Sometimes it is necessary to submit proposals to the DAO for voting:
* DAO parameter changes
* proposal for bonded roles
* contentious proposals for which there is strong interest but no clear consensus

For most general proposals this should not be necessary—general proposals that have clear consensus (or clear lack of consensus) don&amp;#x27;t need to be voted upon in the DAO. In any case, a DAO submission should only be considered after considerable discussion on GitHub so that voters have context and reason to vote one way or another.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Updating BSQ fees&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; takes place every cycle to keep the BSQ [[trading fees]] at a 50% discount to BTC trading fees.

The [[Compensation Maintainer]] takes the following steps to update BSQ trading fees.

__TOC__

== Determine new BSQ fees ==

Three days before the end of proposal phase, the [[Compensation Maintainer]] shall:

* Calculate BSQ trading fee discount [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-hISy7F0NSqPnRxDOoi1k7df1qLJHfQTxhrVLt6NbX4/edit#gid=0 on this spreadsheet] using the 30-day weighted average USD/BSQ price and live USD/BTC price at the time.
** If existing BSQ discount is under 40% or over 60%, calculate new BSQ trading fees to restore a 50% discount. 
** Update spreadsheet with new proposed fees. If there is no need for an update, leave the &amp;quot;New Fees&amp;quot; section blank.

== Submit DAO parameter proposals ==

Upon calculating the new BSQ fees, the [[Compensation Maintainer]] shall:

* Create a new post on [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/ github proposals] with the title &lt;code&gt;BSQ trading fee update for Cycle X&lt;/code&gt; indicating the new proposed trading fees and close the old post (or indicate in a comment at the already opened post if there will be no changes).
* Submit DAO change parameter proposals for new BSQ trading fees and comment the corresponding TXIDs (if necessary).

== Communicate changes ==

Once DAO results are available, the [[Compensation Maintainer]] shall:

* Update the [[trading fees]] page with new BSQ trading fees.

== Reference ==

Proposals [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/173 #173] and [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/365 #365] led to the development of this procedure.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

Sometimes Bisq trades don&amp;#x27;t go smoothly, and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;dispute resolution&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is required to determine an outcome.

Dispute resolution on Bisq has three formal levels: trader chat, [[Mediation|medition]], and [[Arbitration|arbitration]].

Most issues on Bisq are minor and easily resolved when traders communicate with each other. [[Mediation]] is intended to resolve the vast majority of remaining issues. [[Arbitration]] is a rare last resort measure for extreme scenarios.

__TOC__

= Level 1: Trader chat =

If you&amp;#x27;re having any issues completing a trade, or if you just want to keep your counterparty informed (e.g., in case you&amp;#x27;re delayed completing your end of the deal), you can send your counterparty a message through Bisq&amp;#x27;s end-to-end encrypted chat mechanism. This allows traders to communicate with each other throughout the course of a trade to resolve potential trade issues quickly without involving a third party like a [[Mediator|mediator]] or [[Arbitrator|arbitrator]].

[[File:Start-trader-chat.png|600px|thumb|left|Click this icon to start trader chat.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Trader chat rules ==

Hopefully, by following these rules you can work directly with your trading peer to solve issues quickly and amicably.

=== Good Communication is Key ===

Good communication between traders can resolve most disputes. It&amp;#x27;s recommended for traders to communicate any issues they&amp;#x27;re having to keep their peer informed.

However, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;responding to chat messages is always optional&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. If you’re not comfortable responding, don’t. You have no obligation to communicate over this medium with traders. You must, however, respond to [[Mediator|mediators]] and [[Arbitrator|arbitrators]] when needed.

=== Respect a Peer’s Decision to Avoid Responding ===

If a peer seems unresponsive or has signaled their intention to refrain from chatting, please respect it and don’t pressure them.

=== Do Not Send Links of Any Kind ===

For safety reasons, sending links is prohibited. If you want to share a link, describe it instead.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Not allowed:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

 &lt;nowiki&gt;https://blockstream.info/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Allowed:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

 Hey, could you look up txid 4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 in your favorite block explorer?

=== Do Not Encourage Trading Away from Bisq ===

Trades away from Bisq lack Bisq’s security mechanisms. If something goes wrong with an off-Bisq trade, you’re on your own.

=== Do Not Share Sensitive Information ===

Such information is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;never&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; wise to share in general and is never needed to solve trade disputes on Bisq.  This includes passwords, seed words and private keys.  

=== Do Not Engage in Foul Play ===

Any attempts to exploit counterparties with social engineering scams, etc., are prohibited.

=== Keep Conversation Scope Limited to the Trade ===

Please don’t use Bisq’s trader chat as a general-purpose messenger. Unnecessary exchanges add unnecessary strain to Bisq’s peer-to-peer network.

=== Keep Conversation Friendly and Respectful ===

Because friendlier traders resolve disputes quicker, and no one wants to deal with a jerk.

= Level 2: Mediation =

If issues persist after discussing them with the counterparty, you may need to involve a [[Mediator|mediator]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;[[Mediation]] can be initiated at any point during or after the trade period. To do this, select the trade from the &amp;#x27;Open Trades&amp;#x27; list and press &amp;#x27;Ctrl&amp;#x27; + &amp;#x27;O&amp;#x27;.
&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;
[[File:Start-mediation.png|400px|thumb|left|Engage a mediator. This button only appears after the trade period has ended.]]

== How Mediation Works ==

[[Mediator|Mediators]] assess a trade situation between two users and propose a payout suggestion. They don&amp;#x27;t hold a key in the multisig escrow, so their proposal isn&amp;#x27;t authoritative.

=== Trading Peer Expectations ===
* Cooperate with the [[mediator]], providing requested information (quality proof will be asked for payments or bank issues)
* Respond to messages within 48 hours. Non-response might result in [[Table of penalties|penalties]].

=== Mediator Response Time ===

[[Mediator|Mediators]] may take up to 48 hours to respond. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please be patient&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

=== Payout Suggestion ===
* If both peers agree, the payout is completed, and the trade is closed.
* If one or both disagree, a peer can engage an [[Arbitrator|arbitrator]] to reassess the situation (see [[#Level_3:_Arbitration|arbitration]] below).

== When are you eligible for a penalty? ==

If a trader does not follow the [[trading rules]], they risk being [[Table of penalties|penalized]]. Any [[Table of penalties|penalties]] will be taken from the trader&amp;#x27;s BTC [[security deposit]].

The trader at fault will be charged the [[Table of penalties|penalty]], and their [[security deposit]] will be deducted a BTC amount.

The trader that is wronged will receive the [[Table of penalties|BTC penalty]] as compensation. The payout transaction for the trade will include funds from the other trader&amp;#x27;s [[security deposit]].

For more information about what to expect, you can see the [[table of penalties]]. This table acts as a guideline for traders, [[Mediator|mediators]], and [[Arbitrator|arbitrators]] to ensure [[Table of penalties|penalty]] are applied in a fair and impartial way.

== Who are mediators? ==

[[Mediator]] roles are [https://docs.bisq.network/user-dao-intro.html#ensure-honesty-in-high-trust-roles bonded roles] in the [[DAO_user_reference#Bisq_DAO|Bisq DAO]]. Anyone can propose to become a [[mediator]], but approval will depend on the candidate&amp;#x27;s familiarity with Bisq [[Trading rules|trading rules]] and the network’s need for more [[mediator|mediators]] at the time a proposal is made.

Once a proposal to become a [[mediator]] is approved by [[DAO_user_reference#Voting_Cycle|DAO voting]], the [[mediator]] must lock a 10,000 BSQ bond to become active. This bond helps to ensure their continued availability and performance in the role, and can be confiscated by [[DAO_user_reference#Voting_Cycle|DAO voting]] in extreme circumstances (negligence, foul play, prolonged absence, etc).

You can see more details (current role owners, regular updates, etc) on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/83|mediator role issue].

== Where to communicate with mediators? ==

You can communicate with your [[mediator]] directly in the Bisq app. When you initiate a trade and open a [[mediation]], a support ticket is automatically created within the app. You can find this in the &amp;#x27;Support&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;Mediation&amp;#x27; section.

Communicating with [[Mediator|mediators]] inside the app is preferred.

In case you&amp;#x27;re unable to communicate within the Bisq app for any reason, you can also reach out to them on [[Matrix bisq.chat|Matrix]].

Find more information on [[finding your mediator|finding your mediator here]].

== How to find your mediators? ==

Your [[mediator|mediator&amp;#x27;s]] name should be visible when you open a mediation ticket. Look for it under the &amp;#x27;support agent&amp;#x27; column.

If, however, you have a trade not in mediation but would like to know your assigned mediator&amp;#x27;s name, please refer to [[Finding your mediator]].

= Level 3: Arbitration =

[[File:Engage-arbitrator-v116.png|400px|thumb|left|Reject mediator&amp;#x27;s suggestion in order to start arbitration.]]
[[Arbitration]] is the final tier of dispute resolution on Bisq. It&amp;#x27;s designed to be rare, and its measures are intended for extreme situations. [[Arbitration]] is only available when:
* One or both traders reject a [[mediator|mediator&amp;#x27;s]] proposed solution.
* The [[Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction|time-locked transaction]] (the delayed payout transaction created at the trade&amp;#x27;s start) is published by one of the traders.

This transaction sends &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;all&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; funds in the multisig escrow (both traders&amp;#x27; funds) to the [[Burning Men]].

The delayed payout transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed for altcoin trades, or 20 days for fiat trades.

Consider this transaction as a safeguard or fallback option, to be used only when other options have failed.

{{Admonition_Warn|[[Mediation]] is expected to be the best resolution for both traders. If a trade goes to [[arbitration]], the [[arbitrator]] will pay out the trade amount plus one peer&amp;#x27;s [[security deposit]]. This means the total [[arbitration]] payout will be less than the [[mediation]] payout. Both traders agreeing to the [[mediator|mediator&amp;#x27;s]] suggestion is the preferred outcome. Requesting [[arbitration]] should be reserved for exceptional circumstances, such as one peer not responding, or if a trader believes the [[mediator]] did not make a fair payout suggestion.

This dynamic enables a form of mutually assured destruction, driving dispute resolution on Bisq without relying on trusted third parties.}}

Practically, here&amp;#x27;s how [[arbitration]] works:

# If you&amp;#x27;re trading with an unresponsive peer or feel the [[mediator|mediator&amp;#x27;s]] suggestion was unfair, publish the time-locked transaction as soon as possible and request [[arbitration]].
# Collaborate with the [[arbitrator]] to clarify your case&amp;#x27;s details.
# If the [[arbitrator]] sides with you, they will personally reimburse you.
# The [[arbitrator]] will then request reimbursement from the [[DAO_user_reference#Bisq_DAO|Bisq DAO]] for the reimbursements they&amp;#x27;ve paid. This isn&amp;#x27;t something you need to worry about as a trader, but it&amp;#x27;s good to know how the process works on both sides.
# [[arbitrator|Arbitrators]] are required to respond to messages within 5 days, so it may take a bit longer for them to respond than mediators (you should still respond to messages within 2 days).

=== Burning Men Protocol ===
All trades placed from 1st January 2023 will use a new trade protocol ([[Burning Men|Burning Men Protocol]]), designed to further improve Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralization. The new protocol is a result of the proposal [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 Distribute Burningman role to contributors who burned BSQ], which was approved in Bisq DAO cycle 41 with 100% approval ([https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/386 do not pay out the security deposit of the trade peer to the arbitration case winner]). The protocol change means trades placed from 1st January 2023 will have an important difference should the trade end in [[arbitration]].

{{Admonition_Warn|This change means that if a trade ends in [[arbitration]], the [[arbitrator]] will only payout the trade amount plus one user&amp;#x27;s [[security deposit]]. Traders ending in [[arbitration]] will notice the following:
* The [[arbitration]] &amp;#x27;winner&amp;#x27; will not be compensated for the inconvenience caused by the trade going to [[arbitration]].
* The [[arbitration]] &amp;#x27;loser&amp;#x27; will not be refunded their [[security deposit|deposit]] partially or in full.}}

This change is necessary for the security of the new protocol.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Remember, [[arbitration]] should be seen as a last resort. All efforts should be made for traders to come to an agreement with themselves or via the [[mediator]].&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

= If all else fails =

One advantage of a flat, decentralized governance structure that encourages user involvement is that no user should ever feel hindered from receiving a fair trade outcome because of a single individual&amp;#x27;s decision. Bisq isn&amp;#x27;t a black-box corporation with inscrutable processes. It&amp;#x27;s an open software project that is governed openly.

Therefore, for whatever reason, if the process above doesn&amp;#x27;t work for you, you can make a [[Making_a_reimbursement_request|make a reimbursement request]] yourself in the [[DAO_user_reference#Bisq_DAO|Bisq DAO]]. The [[DAO_user_reference#Bisq_DAO|Bisq DAO]] &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not any single individual is the ultimate arbiter of policy and decision-making for all things Bisq&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

In fact, this is how [[arbitration]] will eventually be handled anyway.</text></revision></page><page><title>User support</title><ns>0</ns><id>18</id><revision><id>2930</id><timestamp>2022-02-26T17:30:51Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Resyncing the SPV file&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can solve wallet issues such as incorrect balance showing, missing transactions, etc.

__TOC__

= How to Resync the SPV File =

It is best to initiate an SPV resync from within Bisq. Sometimes this isn&amp;#x27;t possible, so we include directions on how to initiative an SPV resync from your file system too.

== From the Bisq interface ==

Go to &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Network Info&lt;/code&gt; and click &lt;code&gt;Delete SPV File and Resync&lt;/code&gt;. Bisq will prompt you to restart twice, and depending on the age of your wallet and how many transactions it has, it may take a while to finish syncing. It is normal for your machine to reach high CPU usage levels, and Bisq may not be responsive until syncing has finished.

[[File:Resync-spv-file.png|600px|thumb|left|Where to initiate an SPV resync from within the Bisq interface.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== From the file system ==

Close Bisq, delete the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/wallet/bisq.spvchain&lt;/code&gt; from your [[Data_directory|data directory]], start Bisq, wait for it to load, and then &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;restart Bisq again&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Bisq will not prompt you to restart it again—so don&amp;#x27;t forget to actually do it!

Depending on the age of your wallet and how many transactions it has, it may take a while to finish syncing. During syncing, it&amp;#x27;s normal for your machine to reach high CPU usage levels, and Bisq may not be responsive until syncing has finished.

== Fix an incomplete SPV resync ==
If the SPV resync hangs, and you have no choice other than restarting Bisq, only to find out the resync starts again from scratch, then, while Bisq is closed, delete the &lt;code&gt;resyncSpv&lt;/code&gt; file in the root folder of your [[Data_directory#Default_locations|data directory]] and try again, Bisq should pick up from where it left off at the previous attempt. Important to note is that, after you do this, the UI will load before the SPV resync has finished, so the total amount of funds will not be correctly displayed until the block rescan is complete (you can repeat the previous procedure more than once if needed, so the resync can complete in several parts).

[[Category:Use Cases]]</text></revision></page><page><title>Remote control via web browser using xpra</title><ns>0</ns><id>560</id><revision><id>3197</id><timestamp>2023-05-12T13:57:21Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

This guide will have you follow the steps needed to run Bisq on a headless server (could even be a VPS), running Linux (preferably Debian or one of its derivatives), and accessing it using a web browser as if you were in front of the application itself (tested with Firefox, should work with any other major alternative).

== Requirements ==

As a rule of thumb, at least 1GB of free RAM is needed, as are 2GB of disk space, on an amd64 architecture (no Raspberry Pi will work, nor old 32bit CPUs, while your average 64bit desktop CPU will run just fine).

== Installing xpra ==

As customary, update your system:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

For good measure, add xpra repository
	
&lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/pre&gt;
	
Add the following to bottom of file and then save with &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Ctrl-X&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; followed by &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Y&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

&lt;pre&gt;deb https://xpra.org/ bullseye main # edit &amp;quot;bullseye&amp;quot; with your version if needed&lt;/pre&gt;
	
Add xpra GPG key

&lt;pre&gt;wget -q https://xpra.org/gpg.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -&lt;/pre&gt;
	
Refresh repositories

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/pre&gt;
	
and install

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt install xpra&lt;/pre&gt;
	
Verify

&lt;pre&gt;xpra --version&lt;/pre&gt;

== Installing Bisq from source ==

We are going to run Bisq on a headless system (no desktop environment) so installing the deb file will most likely not work. Since we are nerds and like to do things the hard way, we will get the source from github, and build the application ourselves.

=== Create Bisq user ===

If you deem it functional, add a user specifically for Bisq

&lt;pre&gt;sudo adduser --gecos &amp;quot;&amp;quot; --disabled-password bisq&lt;/pre&gt;
	
=== Install git and Java ===

We will need the git package to clone Bisq repository, and Java so that Bisq will run

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt install default-jre default-jdk git&lt;/pre&gt;
	
=== Prepare paths for Bisq ===

Move in a folder where you want the &lt;code&gt;bisq&lt;/code&gt; application folder to reside, we will use the &lt;code&gt;bisq&lt;/code&gt; user as per the example above, and the custom &lt;code&gt;myapps&lt;/code&gt; subfolder of your home (you can place it direcly in home, or wherever you please where the running user has r/w access)

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo su - bisq
mkdir -p myapps
cd myapps
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Install Bisq ===
	
Clone the latest version repository and compile the source:

&lt;pre&gt;
git clone --branch release/v1.9.10 https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq # change 1.9.10 with current latest version
cd bisq
./gradlew build
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Use Bisq remotely ==

Now the fun begins, as you can run bisq through xpra:

&lt;pre&gt;xpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop&lt;/pre&gt;
	
Then, from the browser on your local machine, go to &lt;code&gt;remoteserverip:9876&lt;/code&gt;
	
It will load into a GUI, where you should see your Bisq app barely showing in the bottom right corner; if that happens, click on the &amp;quot;images/windows&amp;quot; icon in the top floating menu, you should see a list of Bisq windows; press the &amp;quot;maximize&amp;quot; icon to show the windows on your screen, and then act accordingly. The same menu action might be needed when popups are shown, as in order to interact with buttons in said popups you sometimes have to manually focus on the popup via the floating menu.

When you have to restart Bisq for any reason (for example to refresh tor files, to resync SPV or DAO state) you have to run, on the remote machine:

&lt;pre&gt;
xpra stop :100 # to stop the running xpra instance
xpra stop :100 # once more, to REALLY stop the running xpra instance (sometimes it won&amp;#x27;t work with just one call, especially when restarting Bisq)
xpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop # to restart Bisq through xpra
&lt;/pre&gt;
	
This command will make you wait 20s as a timeout to fully close any existing xpra sessions, after which the application will be launched. You should make the above lines into an executable script, so you can just launch that and have it (re)start Bisq:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /home/bisq
nano bisqxpra
# add the above lines in the file and then save with Ctrl-X and press Y
chmod +x bisqxpra
./bisqxpra #launch Bisq
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tips ==
When you want to restart Bisq, you could just execute the above script, but it would terminate Bisq in a potentially breaking way, so it&amp;#x27;s best to first log into the web interface, close Bisq using the window close button, and only then start the script.

Want to use a custom data folder, just like you maybe used a custom application folder? Add the relevant parameter to the Bisq command:

&lt;pre&gt;
# make sure you leave the quotes in, to enclose the command to start as a single entity

Want to add password authentication, so the Bisq instance isn&amp;#x27;t accessible to just anyone finding its port on the local network?

&lt;pre&gt;
# replace password123 with your password, no need for advanced security as anyone able to access your remote server to see this, will have also access to Bisq anyway

You can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;run Bisq from the command line&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; with the following commands. There are several options you can specify—[[Command_line_options|see a rundown here]].

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Specifying &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;command line options&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can enable additional non-default settings when [[Running_from_the_command_line|running Bisq from the command line]].

See a full list of available options [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/common/src/main/java/bisq/common/config/Config.java#L57 in the code]. This article covers more notable ones for typical use cases.

__TOC__

== Specify a different data directory ==

The default data directory Bisq uses is called &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot;. All Bisq data is fully contained in it. The [[Data_directory#Default_locations|default path]] of this data directory varies based on your operating system. To change the default path too, [[#Specify_a_different_data_directory_path|see below]].

You can specify a different data directory with &lt;code&gt;--appData=BisqTest&lt;/code&gt; (change &amp;quot;BisqTest&amp;quot; to whatever you want; &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; is the default) and Bisq will create a brand new data directory in the [[Data_directory#Default_locations|default path]] with a new wallet, keys, onion address, etc (or use the existing data directory with that name if it&amp;#x27;s already there).

You can use this option to run more than one instance of Bisq at once, which can be helpful to send funds from one Bisq instance to another when [[Switching_to_a_new_data_directory#Send_funds|switching to a new data directory]].

[[#Include_command-line_options_by_default|See below]] for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.

== Specify a different data directory path ==

If you&amp;#x27;d like to change the default path for the data directory altogether (e.g. to store the data directory on another drive), run Bisq with &lt;code&gt;--appDataDir=/external/hard/drive/path&lt;/code&gt;.

[[#Include_command-line_options_by_default|See below]] for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.

== Dump delayed payout transactions ==

Add the &lt;code&gt;--dumpDelayedPayoutTxs=true&lt;/code&gt; option to dump delayed payout transactions in the following files in your data directory, inside the &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; folder:

# delayed_payout_txs_closed.json
# delayed_payout_txs_pending.json
# delayed_payout_txs_failed.json

== Specify a Bitcoin node ==

Sometimes Bisq cannot connect to the node specified in the interface at &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Network Info&lt;/code&gt;, so starting Bisq with &lt;code&gt;--btcNodes=&lt;node address&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can help.

[[#Include_command-line_options_by_default|See below]] for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.

== See all Bisq trades ==

See all Bisq trades by running the &lt;code&gt;--dumpStatistics=true&lt;/code&gt; option. Then check out &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/db/trade_statistics.json&lt;/code&gt;.

[[#Include_command-line_options_by_default|See below]] for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.

== Include command-line options by default ==

If there are certain options you&amp;#x27;d like to include every time you start Bisq, you can make a script that specifies them for you. 

For example, this script specifies an alternative data directory path on macOS:

 #!/bin/bash
 
 /Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appDataDir=/external/hard/drive/path

Replace the Bisq executable path above with the [[Running_from_the_command_line|one for your operating system]] and specify the options you want to include. Then put the script somewhere in your system path so you can easily call it.

Optionally, consider making a dummy directory in the default location to prevent Bisq from accidentally launching in its default mode. To do this, create a directory named &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; in the default [[Data_directory#Default_locations|data directory path]] for your operating system without any permissions.

For example, on macOS:

 $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/
 $ mkdir Bisq
 $ chmod 000 Bisq

In this way, since the system won&amp;#x27;t have write access in the default location, launching Bisq normally will fail, reminding you to launch Bisq with your script.</text></revision></page><page><title>Troubleshooting network issues</title><ns>0</ns><id>23</id><revision><id>3009</id><timestamp>2022-08-17T21:47:22Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

You may be experiencing &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;network issues&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; if you&amp;#x27;re stuck on Bisq&amp;#x27;s initial loading screen for a while. Often this results in a screen mentioning outdated Tor files and other Tor settings. This could occur for a number of reasons.

__TOC__

== Weak internet connection ==

Bisq generally needs a strong, fast connection to work properly. Tethering on mobile connections can work but is known to cause issues.

== 3/4 connection problem ==

If Bisq stalls at step 3/4 of the startup sequence for more than 5 minutes it means the initial data download from seednodes has failed, or is taking too long.
This can happen on weak or slow internet connections, or if Tor is having issues relaying the large data download to your node.
Proposed mitigation is to clear the Tor cachefiles. (Close Bisq first). All files except &lt;code&gt;hiddenservice&lt;/code&gt; can be deleted from &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/tor&lt;/code&gt; beneath the [[https://bisq.wiki/Data_directory#Default_locations data directory]], they will be re-created as necessary at startup.  &lt;code&gt;hiddenservice&lt;/code&gt; should be kept as it defines your onion address.

See https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2547#issuecomment-1016787843

For a geekier approach, you can also try [[Manually_select_seednodes|manually choosing seednodes to connect to]]

== Windows antivirus software ==

Antivirus software is known to cause connection issues. Try turning it off to see if it helps Bisq to connect, and if it does, consider switching antivirus software or running Bisq on another operating system on which you don&amp;#x27;t need to run antivirus.

== Being temporarily banned by the Tor network ==

Trying to open Bisq too many times in a short timeframe can result in failing to connect to the Tor network. Simple wait 30-60 minutes and then try opening Bisq again.

== Tor censorship ==

In certain situations, Bisq may fail to start because your ISP or network provider is actively blocking Tor.

Tor is tries to fight such obstacles by providing &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;bridges&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Bridges help you connect to the Tor network through a less well-known node. If you know someone who runs a bridge, you can ask to use their bridge, or you can go to https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges to pick a bridge listed by the Tor Project.

If you&amp;#x27;re in China, [[在中国运行Bisq_(Running_Bisq_in_China)|this method using SStap]] has worked to get around the Great Firewall.

==Tor bridges that don&amp;#x27;t work ==

Some network administrators try really hard to block all Tor activity on their network (universities are infamous for this) and will even sometimes block specific types of SSL traffic and handshakes.

In these scenarios, consider using a VPN and then running Bisq from within the VPN tunnel.

== Altcoin nodes running on the same computer ==

Some forks of the Bitcoin repository (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc) are known to cause issues with Bisq starting up. Bisq can sometimes recognize altcoin nodes as Bitcoin nodes, causing Bisq to try connecting to them and then failing when it finds no Bitcoin blocks.

To solve this, switch altcoin nodes off, turn Bisq on and let it load completely. Then, turn the altcoin nodes back on.</text></revision></page><page><title>Delete and resync SPV file</title><ns>0</ns><id>280</id><revision><id>1282</id><timestamp>2020-05-31T23:09:18Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

This guide shows &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;how to run Bisq in a dedicated qube in QubesOS&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The steps were tested using QubesOS 4.0.3 and a Bisq qube based on the &lt;code&gt;debian-10&lt;/code&gt; template.

__TOC__

= How to setup =

== In dom0 ==

Execute the following steps in dom0.

=== Create qube ===

Create a new dedicated qube called &lt;code&gt;bisq-vm&lt;/code&gt; based on the &lt;code&gt;debian-10&lt;/code&gt; template.

* Q Menu &gt; Create Qubes VM &gt; Qube based on a template
* Template: choose &lt;code&gt;debian-10&lt;/code&gt;
* Check &amp;quot;Launch settings after creation&amp;quot;
* Press OK

Within a few seconds, the qube is created and the Qube Settings popup opens. Adjust it as follows:

* Basic &gt; Disk Storage
** Set &amp;quot;Private Storage max size&amp;quot; to at least &lt;code&gt;5000 MiB&lt;/code&gt; [1]
* Advanced &gt; Memory / CPU
** Set &amp;quot;Initial memory&amp;quot; to &lt;code&gt;6000 MB&lt;/code&gt; [2]
** Set &amp;quot;vCPUs no.&amp;quot; to &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;
** Uncheck &amp;quot;Include in memory balancing&amp;quot; [3]
* Press OK

== In dedicated qube ==

Execute the following steps in the &lt;code&gt;bisq-vm&lt;/code&gt; qube.

=== Create binding dirs ===

Create the binding dirs needed for the Bisq installation:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/opt/bisq
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/usr/share/desktop-directories
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart the qube to apply the binding dir settings.

=== Configure binding dirs ===

Setup the binding dirs mapping for the system folders needed for the Bisq installation:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo mkdir -p /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Specify which system folders are mapped to binding dirs. To do that, create the configuration file:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo nano /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

and populate it with the following lines [5] :

&lt;pre&gt;
binds+=( &amp;#x27;/opt/bisq&amp;#x27; )
binds+=( &amp;#x27;/usr/share/desktop-directories&amp;#x27; )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Install Bisq ===

=== Download Debian package ===

Go to the [https://bisq.network/downloads Bisq Downloads] page and download the Debian package and the corresponding PGP signature.

==== Verify PGP signature ====

Check that the downloaded package matches the signature [4]. Assuming the files were downloaded in the Downloads folder:

&lt;pre&gt;
# Go to the folder where you downloaded the .deb package and the PGP signature
cd Downloads

# Import the signing key of Alejandro Garcia (alejandrogarcia83)
curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import

# Verify the signature of the downloaded binary
gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify Bisq-*.asc
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Install package ====

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg -i Bisq-*.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;

Once this command finishes, Bisq is installed and ready to run.

= How to run =

== From dedicated qube ==

Bisq can be started by running &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;bisq-vm&lt;/code&gt; qube.

== From dom0 ==

To start Bisq directly from dom0, a keyboard shortcut can be defined:

* Q Menu &gt; System Tools &gt; Keyboard &gt; Application Shortcuts
* Add a shortcut where the command has the format &lt;code&gt;qvm-run -q -a &lt;qube-name&gt; &lt;command&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** For example, in our case: &lt;code&gt;qvm-run -q -a bisq-vm /opt/bisq/bin/Bisq&lt;/code&gt;
* Assign a system-wide key combination for starting Bisq
** For example &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Alt+B&lt;/code&gt;
* Press OK

Now pressing the key combination anywhere in QubesOS will automatically start the Bisq application.

= References =

[1] Assuming you only use this Qube for Bisq, this amount of storage will be used for all Bisq files (downloaded installer, installation folder, your local Bisq settings and profile, your Bisq wallet, Bisq logs, etc). Therefore it is important to have enough disk space available, because if Bisq runs out of storage space, this may lead to data corruption and loss of funds. For reference: A fresh Qube containing only a fully sync-ed new installation of Bisq 1.3.6, with no trades / accounts / balances, uses about 1GB of space.

[2] Bisq needs 4 GB, the rest is for other OS processes.

[3] This will ensure that the RAM allocated to this qube is not shared with other Qubes.

[4] For more details, see Verifications section on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/ Bisq GitHub releases page]

[5] The &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/desktop-directories&lt;/code&gt; is not really used, but is required during installation. See [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/848 Issue 848]

__TOC__

== Overview ==
Unlike most operating systems, [https://tails.boum.org/about/ Tails runs &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;entirely&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in memory.] When Tails shuts down, memory contents are deleted, restoring the OS to its original state. Only files saved to the [https://tails.boum.org/doc/persistent_storage/ Persistent Storage] survive a reboot.

Therefore, Bisq must be reinstalled (and configured) after every boot. More importantly, Bisq&amp;#x27;s [[data directory|default data directory]] must be relocated to the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Persistent Storage&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; so that your wallet, keys, etc. are not lost every time Tails shuts down.

This is easy to automate with an installation script.

== Preparations ==
=== Configure Tails ===

On the Tails [https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/ Welcome Screen:]
* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/ Set up an administration password.]
* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/persistent_storage/create/ Create Persistent Storage.]

Once Persistent Storage has been created, a settings window will open automatically. You can also open it from the desktop menu:  &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Tails&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Persistent Storage&lt;/code&gt;.
* Enable the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Persistent Folder&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in the above settings.

=== Configure the Persistent Folder ===

* Create a directory to store the Bisq installer (and installation script):
:&lt;code&gt;mkdir /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/&lt;/code&gt;
* Create a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;persistent data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; for your Bisq user data:
:&lt;code&gt;mkdir /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/&lt;/code&gt;

==== Import user data from backup ====

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;WARNING:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Ensure that the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]] is EMPTY before importing. Do NOT mix user data from different sessions.}}

If you wish to import user data from a previous Bisq installation or backup, copy it into the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]]:
*&lt;code&gt;cp -ra /[backupdirectory]/bisq_backup_version001/. /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/&lt;/code&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;N.B.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; The correct path to your &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt; directory should now be:
:&lt;code&gt;/home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt;

=== Download Bisq ===

* [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Download] and [[Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file|verify]] the Debian (.deb) version of the Bisq installer.
* Move the installer file to the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|Bisq installer directory]]:
:&lt;code&gt;mv /path/to/[yourdownload.deb] /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/&lt;/code&gt;

=== Create installation script ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOTE:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; The script below will install Bisq, configure Tor, and redirect user data to the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]] (by creating a &amp;#x27;symbolic link&amp;#x27;). Every step in the script is explained via &amp;#x27;echo&amp;#x27; commands.

* Create a new script file:
:&lt;code&gt;touch /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/install-bisq.sh&lt;/code&gt;
* Make the file executable:
:&lt;code&gt;chmod +x /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/install-bisq.sh&lt;/code&gt;
* Edit the file, and save the script below.
* On the second line, replace [yourdownload.deb] with the filename of the [[#Download_Bisq|Bisq installer you downloaded]].

== Run Bisq ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOTE:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Your user data is safely stored in the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]]. However, the Bisq application is &amp;#x27;uninstalled&amp;#x27; every time Tails shuts down.

To install Bisq:

* Connect to the Tor network, via the desktop menu:
:&lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Internet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Tor Connection&lt;/code&gt;
* Run the [[#Create_installation_script|installation script]]:
:&lt;code&gt;sudo sh /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/install-bisq.sh&lt;/code&gt;

Once Bisq has been installed, you can either start it from the desktop menu:
*&lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Internet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;
Or via terminal:
*&lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq --torControlPort 951 --torControlCookieFile=/var/run/tor/control.authcookie --torControlUseSafeCookieAuth&lt;/code&gt;

== Maintenance ==
=== Backup user data ===

==== While Bisq is running ====

You can [[Backing_up_application_data#While_Bisq_is_running|backup while Bisq is running]], as normal.

==== While Bisq is closed ====

You can also backup while Bisq is closed, by copying your user data to a backup location. However:

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;REMEMBER:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Your user data is stored in the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]], and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOT&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq&amp;#x27;s [[data directory|default data directory]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;WARNING:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Only backup data into an EMPTY directory. Do NOT mix user data from different sessions.}}

To backup, first create a new (empty) directory for the backup, then copy the [[#Configure_the_Persistent_Folder|persistent data directory]]. For example:
*&lt;code&gt;mkdir /[backupdirectory]/bisq_backup_version001&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;cp -ra /home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/Bisq/. /[backupdirectory]/bisq_backup_version001&lt;/code&gt;

=== Upgrade Bisq to the latest version ===

{{Admonition_Warn|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;WARNING:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Do not downgrade Bisq. Installing an older version could cause irreversible damage to Bisq data.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;NOTE&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Before upgrading, it is recommended to [[#Backup_user_data|backup your user data]].}}

To upgrade Bisq:

* [[#Download_Bisq|Download Bisq]] to &lt;code&gt;/home/amnesia/Persistent/bisq/&lt;/code&gt;
* Update the &lt;code&gt;BisqInstaller=&lt;/code&gt; line of the [[#Create_installation_script|installation script]] with the filename of the new version.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The Bisq network is governed by a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; built on the Bitcoin blockchain.

== Introduction ==

=== What is a DAO? ===

Conventional entities such as for-profit and non-profit corporations must be sanctioned by the state: they are legal entities registered in particular jurisdictions. No matter how big or small or virtuous or innovative they are, they cannot operate without state approval. In return for this approval, the entity is endowed with rights (e.g., limited liability) and responsibilities (e.g., taxes).

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is just a generic term for a governance model sanctioned by software: code defines conventions for governing the project irrespective of the stance of the state.

{{Admonition_Note|We say a DAO’s governance model must be sanctioned by software, not necessarily controlled by software. The Bisq DAO, for example, is not controlled by software: software merely provides a framework for the people involved with the Bisq project to (collectively) manage the software itself. The Bisq DAO operates on the idea that &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;code is not law&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Code is written by humans to provide a service to other humans, so it should be accountable to humans too. }}

The universe of DAOs is diverse. Just as companies come in many shapes and sizes, and some companies are scammy, fraudulent, or just poorly managed—that’s no reason to assume all companies are the same way. It’s the same with DAOs: some DAOs haven’t worked out so well, but others might turn out differently.

== The Bisq DAO ==

The Bisq DAO forgoes a system where governance is dictated by the rigid rules of software in favor of a self-contained economy where governance is guided by software but ultimately determined by the collective, subjective judgments of its community.

It achieves this by introducing a unit of value called the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ token&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that enables Bisq stakeholders—contributors, traders, or anyone who owns BSQ—to make subjective value judgments. This token underlies all actions in the DAO.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvOZlIDYEQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo Click here for a quick introductory video on the what &amp;amp; why of the Bisq DAO]

=== BSQ token ===

{{BSQ_Token_Intro}}

=== Overview ===

Here’s a graphical overview of how the DAO works at a high level:

[[File:User-dao-diagram.png|700px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Let’s observe some of the dynamics of this system:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

* Contributors &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;maintain&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq through valuable work 
* Traders &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;use&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
* Contributors &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;earn&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BSQ tokens when their compensation requests are approved through voting
* Traders &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BSQ tokens in order to pay lower trading fees
* Stakeholders &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;vote&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on compensation requests
* Contributors can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;lock&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; a bond in BSQ to ensure integrity in high-trust roles&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Now let’s see how these dynamics enable the Bisq DAO to provide 3 core governance functions without any central points of authority.

=== Earn and distribute revenue ===

Every project needs to be financially sustainable to fund ongoing operations and development. But traditional means of handling revenue and revenue distribution are necessarily centralized—any receiving address or account must be owned by one person, or a small group; determining how much a person should be paid must be determined by one person, or a small group; etc.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Contributors produce, creating BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In the Bisq DAO, trading fees are collected from traders and distributed to contributors, but there is no central authority to do this. Here’s how it works: after a Bisq contributor does work, they file a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;compensation request&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in the DAO with a description of what they did and how much BSQ they want in return. Then, stakeholders (who are other contributors, traders, and anyone else with BSQ) vote for/against the request. If the request is approved, the contributor is issued new BSQ in the amount they requested and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ supply is increased&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

{{Admonition_Note|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&lt;big&gt;Where does new BSQ actually come from?&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&lt;/br&gt; Recall that a BSQ token is merely colored bitcoin. When a contributor makes their compensation request in the DAO, they must also include the tiny amount of bitcoin to be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;colored&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; as BSQ (the [[DAO_technical_overview|spec]] requires 100 satoshis). So if a contributor requests 1,000 BSQ, they will need to include (100 * 1,000 equals 100,000 satoshis) with their compensation request, just about 10 USD at a rate of (10,000 USD/BTC).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;If their request is approved, those satoshis are &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;colored&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and recognized as 1,000 valid BSQ tokens on Bisq. Assuming a BSQ market value of 1 USD (exact value will fluctuate), the contributor will have been granted 1,000 USD worth of BSQ for a negligible cost of 10 USD.}}

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Traders consume, burning BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Then, a trader looking for lower trading fees can buy those BSQ tokens from a contributor. When they buy BSQ tokens for BTC, the contributor is paid for their work, and the value transfer from producer to consumer is complete! When a trader pays trading fees with BSQ, those BSQ tokens are burned or &amp;quot;decolored&amp;quot; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ supply is decreased&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This process of creating and destroying BSQ tokens enables a sort of [https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html#how-bsq-decentralizes-compensation-and-enables-monetary-policy monetary policy] controlled by Bisq stakeholders and traders.

In this way, there is no need for a central entity to collect and distribute revenue: the BSQ token enables a transfer of value from producer to consumer without any single entity controlling any aspect of the decision-making or distribution process.
{{Admonition_Note|&lt;big&gt;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Note on BTC revenues&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
In the past, before the Bisq DAO launch and before the integration of Bisq’s new trade protocol, trading fees were only collected in BTC and only went to arbitrators. There was no mechanism to distribute them to other contributors. The DAO solves this distribution problem with BSQ through the process outlined above.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
But since traders can still pay trading fees with BTC, where do those BTC fees go?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
BTC fees go to the [[Burning Men]], contributors that burn BSQ to get the chance to receive platform fees.

=== Determine strategy ===

Another point of centralization in traditional organizations is with strategy. How can a project determine strategy without some form of designated leadership: an executive, manager, or leader to give direction and allocate resources?

The Bisq DAO beats this tradition with collective decision-making on strategy and other matters through &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;weighted voting&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; based on BSQ stake.

Here’s how it works: any stakeholder can make a proposal in the DAO. It can be anything: a change in a trading parameter, a new bonded role, or even something more generic like an adjustment of overall project strategy. Stakeholders vote on the proposal, and their voting weight is based on BSQ stake, through a combination of two metrics:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

# amount of BSQ committed to a particular vote
# amount of BSQ earned over time through contributions&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Taking both metrics into account discourages deep-pocketed whales from suddenly seizing control of the project, while still valuing dedicated stakeholders with consistent contributions over time. It brings about a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;strict meritocracy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in which people need to somehow buy in to the Bisq project in order to take part in its governance, and the more significant their stake, the stronger their voice.

In this way, there is no need to rely on a single leadership team for direction: the community collectively manages itself.

=== Ensure honesty in high-trust roles ===

Despite the Bisq project’s attempts to resist concentrating control as much as possible, it’s impossible to avoid in some places. Domain name owners, social account admins, mediators, various node operators: these are all roles that must exist, but necessarily retain significant control and require a high degree of trust.

Part of the benefit of a centralized team of thoroughly-vetted people reliant on a paycheck, as is the case in most companies, is that the risk of trusting people with significant responsibility is lower: they have a lot to lose if the company finds they have violated their integrity and engaged in foul play.

This dynamic can be reproduced—at least partly—in a project without a central authority through &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;bonding&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The concept is simple enough: create skin in the game. Require that a person interested in taking on a high-trust role post a bond that’s high enough to discourage them from engaging in foul play.

But what happens if that person goes rogue? In a project without central authority, who decides when they’ve crossed the line, and what their fate should be?

As with strategy and compensation, the community decides through voting. Anyone who suspects foul play can make a case for confiscating a bond with a new proposal, and stakeholders vote to determine an outcome.

{{Admonition_Warn|Confiscating a bond is a harsh penalty which should not be taken lightly. Therefore, the Bisq DAO makes confiscation proposals especially hard to approve: they require a quorum of at least 200,000 BSQ and 85% acceptance to pass (instead of the typical &gt;50%).}}

In this way, the risk that people in high-trust roles misbehave is minimized, and the community has access to a responsible mechanism for handling such a scenario in cases that warrant it.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

This &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;DAO user reference&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; covers practical details on the workings of the Bisq DAO for traders and contributors.

Some basic DAO functions like paying trading fees, making proposals, and voting may not seem complex, but implementing these functions on peer-to-peer networks (Bitcoin and Bisq’s own P2P network) adds extensive technical complexity.

Immense technical challenges aside, the practical constraints of the Bisq DAO are not trivial. One requirement is complete decentralization of decision-making (no persons with special powers) and funding (no central wallets or accounts to store and distribute funds). Another is that incentives must be so well-aligned that stakeholders are naturally motivated to grow and support the DAO merely by acting rationally—there are no managers to promote you (or fire you).

And perhaps most critically, the DAO needs to be secure: safe from hackers and scammers trying to take advantage of the DAO and its users.

__TOC__

== BSQ Token ==

Contributors earn BSQ for working on Bisq, and traders spend BSQ to trade on Bisq. This basic dynamic is covered in [[Introduction_to_the_DAO|the DAO introduction article]] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvOZlIDYEQ&amp;amp;list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e in this video series].

But what actually &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;is&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BSQ, and where does it come from?

A single BSQ token is denominated as 100 satoshis (i.e., it&amp;#x27;s represented on the Bitcoin blockchain as 0.00000100 BTC). This bitcoin is &amp;#x27;colored&amp;#x27; with additional properties that causes Bisq software to recognize it as BSQ.

BSQ can only be created in one of two ways:

# through the genesis distribution (detailed below)
# through an issuance transaction (compensation request or reimbursement request)

=== BSQ Genesis Distribution ===

The Bisq DAO did not launch with a supply of zero BSQ tokens. An initial supply of BSQ tokens was created to account for all the contributions to the Bisq project before the mainnet launch of the Bisq DAO.

These contributions can be divided into 2 segments.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;1. Before October 2017&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In the early days of the project, before Bisq tracked compensation requests and voting results, Bisq collected donations. In October 2017, as part of the implementation of the Phase Zero plan, it was decided that 2.5 BTC of all donations would be distributed back to these patrons as BSQ where each person would receive an amount proportional to their prior contributions.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;2. After October 2017&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In October 2017, the plan outlined in the Phase Zero plan went into effect. Subsequent contributions to Bisq were [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues documented on GitHub] and stakeholders voted to approve those contributions [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlXDswj3251BPCOcII-UyWlX7o7jMkfYBE-IZ5te5Ck on this spreadsheet].

The genesis BSQ distribution issued the sum of both these segments of past contributions.

Ultimately, the genesis transaction issued [https://mempool.space/bisq/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 3,657,480 BSQ to over 200 past contributors]. You can see [https://mempool.space/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 the corresponding Bitcoin transaction here].

Addresses were confirmed over email, Slack, Twitter, and on these two GitHub threads: [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/260 one], [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/263 two].

== Bisq DAO ==

=== Technical Overview ===

There are 2 key points to note about how the Bisq DAO works.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;1. Every DAO action is an on-chain Bitcoin transaction.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; 

Every DAO action requires BSQ, and since BSQ is bitcoin, every DAO action is also recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. As noted above, this does NOT mean you should try to form your own BSQ transactions. But it does mean that every action you take on the Bisq DAO is immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain, publicly verifiable, and virtually impossible to reverse.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;2. Bitcoin provides transaction integrity, and Bisq&amp;#x27;s own P2P network provides storage.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

DAO actions such as making proposals and voting include extra data such as text and links that don&amp;#x27;t belong on the Bitcoin blockchain. This extra data is stored on Bisq&amp;#x27;s own P2P network (literally, Bisq users&amp;#x27; hard drives). A hash of that extra data is included in the &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; output of the corresponding Bitcoin transaction. Then, the Bitcoin transaction ID is added to the extra data and broadcast to peers on the Bisq network.

You can visualize it like this:

[[File:Bisq-dao-data-model.png|thumb|left|600px|How Bisq DAO data is stored]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Storing a hash of the extra data on the Bitcoin blockchain ensures any attempts to manipulate it will fail, since the hash of the manipulated data will change and then not match the hash recorded in the corresponding Bitcoin transaction.

{{Admonition_Note|There&amp;#x27;s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here, since the Bitcoin transaction ID can only be known after the Bitcoin transaction is made, and the hash of a data object can only be made once the Bitcoin transaction ID is known. 

To get around this, the data object is hashed with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; in place of the Bitcoin transaction ID, and the Bitcoin transaction ID is added afterward. Later, when the integrity of the data object needs to be validated, the Bitcoin transaction ID is replaced with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; before the data object is hashed.}}

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;For a more thorough treatment of the technical workings of the Bisq DAO, see the [[DAO_technical_overview|technical overview article]].&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=== Voting Cycle ===

Voting cycles are timed to last about 1 month. Duration is measured in blocks, so actual calendar/clock times may vary.

==== Proposal Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;3600 blocks, about 24 days&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

During this time, Bisq stakeholders (contributors and traders) can make proposals. It is not possible to edit a proposal, but it is possible to remove a proposal and submit a corrected one (only during this phase).

There is a small fee to make proposals to discourage spam. Fees for proposals that are removed are not reimbursed.

Proposals requesting the issuance of new BSQ will also require a small amount of BTC to be included in the proposal transaction so there is BTC to &amp;#x27;color&amp;#x27; into BSQ. The spec requires 100 satoshis per BSQ token, so a request for 1000 BSQ will require 1000 × 100 = 100,000 satoshis.

Keep in mind that the actual BSQ you end up with will be net the proposal fee: if your request for 1000 BSQ is approved, and if the proposal fee is 2 BSQ, you will end up with 998 BSQ in your wallet.

For compensation requests, please make sure you follow [[Compensation#Contributor|established conventions and recommendations]].

If the proposal phase ends before you can make your proposal, simply wait and make your proposal in the next proposal phase.

===== Other Details =====

As illustrated in the image above, proposal transactions are published on the Bitcoin network and proposal data objects are broadcast on the Bisq P2P network. The Bitcoin transaction includes a hash of the proposal data object.

After the proposal phase is over, there is a break of 150 blocks (about 1 day) to review and discuss proposals before voting begins.

==== Blind Voting Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;450 blocks, about 3 days&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

You may approve, reject, or abstain from casting a vote on proposals. It is highly recommended that you only approve or reject proposals for which you can make a well-informed decision.

It is not necessary to have made a proposal to be able to vote—any stakeholder (anyone with BSQ) can participate in voting.

Once you have made your selections, you must specify a stake and publish your votes.

Votes cannot be changed once they are published.

===== Voting Stake =====

Your voting weight is determined by 2 factors: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;reputation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (how much BSQ you&amp;#x27;ve earned), and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (how much of your owned BSQ you allot to your vote) that you specify in your vote transaction.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is the amount of BSQ earned by doing work for the Bisq network, independent of the amount of BSQ spent or sold. So if Alice earns 10,000 BSQ by working on Bisq, and she sells 8,000 BSQ for BTC to pay her bills, her reputation value remains 10,000 BSQ. Caveat: reputation decays over time. BSQ earned decays linearly over a period of 2 years as soon as it&amp;#x27;s earned. So the reputation value of Alice&amp;#x27;s 10,000 BSQ is 5,000 BSQ one year after she earns it, and zero two years later.

Reputation cannot be specified when making a vote transaction—it&amp;#x27;s automatically calculated for the user from their past contributions.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is the literal amount of BSQ specified for the vote transaction. This is BSQ you own that you would like to devote to your vote. The more BSQ you allot, the more weight your vote will hold. BSQ specified for stake is unspendable for the duration of the voting cycle.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Total voting weight is the sum of reputation value and specified stake.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

BSQ earned is worth more than BSQ bought. The idea is that there is no better measure of good-will and dedication to the project than actually working on the project. The arrangement still allows people who buy into the project considerable influence, while hopefully minimizing the potential of whales with bad intentions from buying their way in and sabotaging the project.

===== Other Details =====

Votes are published on the Bitcoin network and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;encrypted&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; vote data objects are broadcast on the Bisq P2P network (hence the term &amp;#x27;blind&amp;#x27; vote). The Bitcoin transaction includes a hash of the vote data object. BSQ specified for voting stake is also specified in this transaction, and cannot be spent until the vote reveal transaction is published.

Following the end of the blind voting phase, there is a break of 10 blocks to protect against reorgs.

==== Vote Reveal Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;450 blocks, about 3 days&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

No action is required of the user during this phase aside from having the Bisq software online at some point during the vote reveal phase so it can publish the vote reveal transaction.

You will see a pop-up in the UI when the transaction has been published.

===== Other Details =====

Only a Bitcoin transaction is made in this phase—no additional data is broadcast to the Bisq P2P network.

This transaction includes 2 items:

# the key to decrypt the votes cast in the blind voting phase
# a hash of the list of voting data objects received by the Bisq node making the transaction (ordered by transaction ID; details [[#Determining_Consensus|below]]

One of the inputs to this transaction is the BSQ reserved for stake, so once this transaction is published, that BSQ becomes spendable again.

If a user fails to make their vote reveal transaction, their vote is rendered invalid.

Again, for protection against reorgs, there is a break of 10 blocks after this phase is over.

==== Vote Result Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;10 blocks, about 100 minutes&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

This phase is more of a trigger, so allotting 10 blocks is more for consistency than a hard requirement.

In this phase, Bisq nodes calculate vote results from proposals, voting stake, and votes (which can now be decrypted from the vote reveal transactions).

===== Determining Consensus =====

We can trust that all Bisq nodes will get the same data from the Bitcoin blockchain. However, we cannot be sure that all Bisq nodes have obtained all corresponding data from the Bisq P2P network. It is critical that any potential inconsistencies be handled before determining vote results, otherwise, vote results may differ.

This is why each Bisq node includes a hash of the list of the voting data objects it has received in its vote reveal transaction. While a hash of vote data objects is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain for integrity, it&amp;#x27;s not guaranteed that every &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;voting data object itself&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is actually delivered to every Bisq node.

So, when calculating vote results, the majority hash from the vote reveal transactions (majority by voting stake) is considered to be the authoritative representation of votes for the whole network. Vote result calculations are based on this uniform determination, ensuring consensus across the network.

{{Admonition_Note|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;This majority hash must have at least 80% of the vote stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;—otherwise the whole voting cycle is invalidated and all proposals are rejected. Such inconsistencies should be exceptional, as they would indicate a significant problem with P2P network stability. 

This 80% threshold is also a security measure, as only an attacker with at least 80% of the total stake in a voting cycle could succeed.}}

This threshold was tested in Cycle 20. The majority hash lacked the requisite 80% voting stake consensus because of Tor network issues, so results were invalidated, and there was zero issuance. See [https://bisq.network/blog/cycle-20-results/ more details here].

== Note on Unexpected Situations ==

Great care has been taken to make sure that there are no opportunities for the Bisq DAO to be exploited by scammers, hackers, or others with bad intentions.

Much expertise and theory went into the Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s conception, implementation was careful, and testing was thorough. The resulting software is the best expression of the intention of these collective efforts, but it may not be infallible.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;We say this to establish that Bisq DAO code is not law.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; It has clear intentions, and every effort will be made to fix unintended results.

While we hope nothing will be catastrophic enough to require it, hard forks, confiscation, and new issuances are options to deal with extreme scenarios. BSQ trading and DAO operations can be halted through an alert message from the lead developer. Such messages may be ignored by users if they think the measure is being abused, but ignoring such messages in a situation where the measure &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;is&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; justified may exclude the user from reimbursement in case of losses.</text></revision></page><page><title>Paying trading fees with BSQ</title><ns>0</ns><id>403</id><revision><id>2182</id><timestamp>2021-04-23T20:07:18Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Paying trade fees with BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; enables traders to get a 50% discount on trading fees while compensating Bisq contributors.

This article explains how to get BSQ and use it to pay for trading fees.

__TOC__

== Background ==

Bisq&amp;#x27;s BSQ colored bitcoin token is different from most other exchange tokens: the primary reason it exists is to enable the decentralized operation and management of the Bisq network. That means no central wallets or accounts to accumulate funds, and no legal entity or leadership team to control strategy.

For traders, BSQ offers discounted trading fees. This article covers how to buy BSQ and use it to get a discount on trading fees.

== Acquire BSQ ==

Although BSQ is [[BSQ technically bitcoin]], it’s [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins colored bitcoin] that must be kept in a Bisq wallet, separate from plain bitcoin.

To help you do this, and to avoid mistakes, Bisq automatically generates a separate BSQ wallet with addresses prefixed with a &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;—so you can be sure when you’re sending or receiving from a BSQ address.

=== Retrieve your BSQ address ===

You can find your BSQ wallet address in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;BSQ wallet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Receive&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Bsq-wallet-address.png|700px|thumb|left|Get your BSQ address.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Create BSQ payment account ===

To trade BSQ on Bisq, you need to set up an altcoin account using your BSQ address. If you&amp;#x27;re curious about Instant trades, check out [[Altcoins_Instant this article]].

[[File:Add-new-bsq-account.png|700px|thumb|left|Use your BSQ address to create a BSQ payment account.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Make or take a BSQ offer ===

Once you have a BSQ payment account set up, you can buy and sell BSQ.

Pick an offer you like (or make an offer of your own) and complete the trade.

[[File:Bsq-buy-offers.png|700px|thumb|left|Browse offers to buy BSQ.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Use BSQ to pay trading fees ==

Once you’ve got some BSQ, you can use it to pay trading fees.

When you get to the &lt;code&gt;Take offer&lt;/code&gt; screen where you confirm the trade amount, you’ll see a toggle for trading fees where you can select between BTC and BSQ trading fees.

[[File:trading-fee-toggle.png|700px|thumb|left|Pick BSQ to pay trading fees on the make-offer or take-offer screen.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Pick the option you like better and complete the trade!

{{Admonition Note|[[Trading_fees|Using BSQ to pay trading fees]] is about 50% cheaper then using plan bitcoin, and it also helps pay contributors for their work!}}

== Beyond trading fees ==

BSQ is also a core element of Bisq’s governance mechanism, allowing stakeholders (contributors, traders, and anyone else who uses or helps the project) to have a hand in crafting the strategy of the project through a voting process.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Participating in a DAO voting cycle&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is something any stakeholder can do—Bisq trader, contributor, or anyone else who wants to help the project succeed.

This article covers how to make a proposal and vote on other proposals, as well as how the BSQ token enables this process to be handled in a decentralized and trustless but meritocratic way.

For a brief overview of how the Bisq DAO works at a high level, see the [[Introduction to the DAO|DAO introduction article]].

__TOC__

== Background ==

As covered in the [[Introduction to the DAO]] article, the Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s governance model helps achieve several functions for the Bisq project.

This governance model is composed of voting cycles: periods of 4,679 blocks (approximately 1 month) made of 4 phases:
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Proposal phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which stakeholders submit compensation requests and other proposals requesting reimbursements for trading fees, changes in trading parameters, or changes in some other aspect of the Bisq project. After the proposal phase is over, there is a break of 150 blocks (about 1 day) to review and discuss proposals before voting begins.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Blind voting phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which stakeholders cast their votes on submitted proposals. Votes are encrypted in this phase to prevent later voters from being influenced by earlier voters. Following the end of the blind voting phase, there is a break of 10 blocks to protect against reorgs.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Vote reveal phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which each stakeholder sends the decryption key for their vote. Again, for protection against reorgs, there is a break of 10 blocks after this phase is over.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Vote result phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which vote results are calculated and BSQ is issued accordingly.

You can see approximate start and end dates for the current voting cycle at &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Dashboard&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Show-dao-blocks.png|700px|thumb|left|DAO blocks and estimated calendar times.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Acquire BSQ ==

In order to participate in DAO voting, you will need BSQ. See how to acquire BSQ [[Paying_trading_fees_with_BSQ#Acquire_BSQ|in this article]].

As of this writing, making a proposal costs 2 BSQ and casting a ballot (voting) costs 2 BSQ. You&amp;#x27;ll also need some plain BTC for transaction fees (each DAO action is a bitcoin transaction which requires mining fees to be paid), and if you will be [[Making_a_compensation_request|asking for compensation]] or reimbursement, you&amp;#x27;ll need to include some plain BTC to be colored into BTC (precise amount is 100 satoshis × [requested BSQ amount]).

Keep this in mind when buying BSQ to get started for the first time, and make sure you have a BTC balance in your Bisq wallet that&amp;#x27;s sufficient for what you want to do.

== Make a proposal ==

{{Admonition_Note|Proposals can only be made during the proposal phase. If the voting cycle is in any other phase, you’ll need to wait for the proposal phase of the next voting cycle to make your proposal.}}
{{Admonition_Note|The process for making a compensation request is largely the same as the process outlined here, but see [[Making a compensation request|this article]] for additional considerations.}}

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please read [[Proposals|this article on proposals]] before submitting a proposal for voting.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq proposals tend to be for significant items, and proposals submitted to the DAO are typically for [[Proposals#Submit_to_the_DAO_.28if_needed.29|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;controversial&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; significant items]].

In &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll find the form to make a new proposal. Pick the type of proposal you want to make from the dropdown, fill the form, and hit &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;.
* Make sure the GitHub handle you put in Bisq matches the GitHub handle on the issue. 
* Also make sure to replace &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; with the GitHub proposal number. For example, if submitting proposal #999 with URL https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/999, the DAO proposal URL should be https://bisq.network/dao-proposals/999.

{{Admonition_Warn|Beware that proposals cannot be edited after being submitted. If you need to make a change, you can delete the proposal and make a new one while the proposal phase is still active, but you’ll need to pay the proposal fee again. Once the proposal phase is over, proposals cannot be added or removed until the next proposal phase. }}

Here&amp;#x27;s how making a generic proposal can look:

[[File:Submit-generic-proposal.png|700px|thumb|left|Submit a generic proposal for DAO voting.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Vote on proposals ==

Once the proposal phase is over, after a short break, the voting phase starts.

You can see all proposals in the current voting cycle in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Browse Open Proposals&lt;/code&gt;.

Click through each proposal to see more details, and then vote—it’s strongly recommended that you only accept or reject proposals you know well and have a strong opinion about.

[[File:Vote-proposal.png|400px|thumb|left|Cast votes for proposals during the blind voting phase.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Submit votes ==

When you’re done selecting your votes, you will need to submit your votes.

[[File:Vote-submit.png|400px|thumb|left|Select voting weight and submit all votes.]]

All votes are submitted in a single ballot. Casting a ballot currently costs 2 BSQ + mining fees.

In addition, to submit your votes, you need to specify a BSQ amount to use for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;voting stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The more BSQ you stake for your vote, the more weight it will carry. This staked BSQ cannot be traded or otherwise transferred until your vote reveal transaction is published.

The software has checks to prevent such BSQ from being spent, but if BSQ staked for voting is somehow spent, the corresponding vote will be rendered invalid.

This is why, as you see in the screenshot to the left, it&amp;#x27;s advisable to use most (but not all) of your BSQ for the voting stake—we left some BSQ available for spending in case we need it for other purposes during the remainder of the voting cycle.

&lt;code&gt;Vote weight from earned BSQ&lt;/code&gt; is BSQ earned from contributing to Bisq: this BSQ is treated slightly differently from BSQ bought on the open market when determining a stakeholder’s voting weight.

{{Admonition_Note|For more details on how voting weight is determined, see the [[DAO_user_reference#Voting_Stake|DAO user reference]].}}

Once you’ve entered a voting stake, go ahead and click &lt;code&gt;Vote on all proposals&lt;/code&gt;.

== Reveal your vote == 

After the blind voting phase is over, you must make sure Bisq goes back online at some point during the vote reveal phase to publish your vote reveal transaction.

Bisq will publish the transaction automatically when it’s online, so you don’t have to actually do anything, and you’ll see a pop-up when the transaction is published.

This transaction includes the key to decrypt your vote from the blind voting phase. It also includes a representation of all votes you’ve received from the network, which is used to determine a consensus of all votes cast on the network. See more details [[DAO_user_reference#Vote_Reveal_Phase|here]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Don’t forget this step! If your vote reveal transaction is not published, your vote cannot be decrypted, and so it cannot be counted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

== Get vote results ==

Once the vote reveal phase is over, results are calculated and the next voting cycle starts.

You can see results of the last voting cycle in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Vote Results&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Dao-vote-results.png|700px|thumb|left|Submit a generic proposal for DAO voting.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== See DAO transactions on a block explorer ==

Since DAO transactions are bitcoin transactions, you can see them on any bitcoin block explorer. But because transactions use BSQ (bitcoin colored in a way that only Bisq understands), ordinary bitcoin block explorers can’t recognize which bitcoin transactions are also BSQ transactions.

Hence [https://explorer.bisq.network BSQ block explorers]. Whenever you do a Bisq DAO transaction, including paying trading fees with BSQ, you can see it on a BSQ block explorer.

Here’s a screenshot of the past few BSQ transactions that took place at the end of Cycle 23:

[[File:Mempool-dao-tx-list.png|700px|thumb|left|A listing of Bisq DAO transactions on mempool.space.]]

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

Once you&amp;#x27;ve done some work on the Bisq project, you may want to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;make a compensation request&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; for BSQ.

__TOC__

== Preliminary considerations ==

=== Conventions ===

Compensation requests are generally made for work done in the current DAO cycle—work delivered after the last proposal phase and before the end of the current one—but you can make a request for work done any time in the past as long as you have records of it.

Keep in mind that compensation requests will need to garner a simple majority approval in DAO voting, and before that, team leads will do an initial review of your request. For this to go well, you won&amp;#x27;t want your compensation request to be the first interaction you have with other Bisq contributors. 

Ideally, you will have already had conversations with team leads and other contributors to:
* make them aware of what you want to do
* get others&amp;#x27; feedback on your plans
* get an idea of how valuable your contribution is to the project(so your compensation request is reasonable to you &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to stakeholders)
** don&amp;#x27;t hesitate to suggest a ballpark cost before getting started, if one is not already suggested by other contributors; this helps avoid surprises and hurt feelings at compensation request time

It would be even better to have public threads (issues, pull requests, other discussion threads) tracking your work, progress, and outcomes to help stakeholders put your compensation request into perspective. This is somewhat intuitive for development-related tasks, but non-development contributors should strongly consider making issues in the appropriate repositories or forums too.

For more guidance on how you can get started contributing to Bisq, check out the [[contributor checklist]].

{{Admonition_Warn|Please try not to nickel-and-dime in your compensation request. Charging top dollar for fly-by-night code reviews and minor text corrections are usually seen as red flags, and will probably not be received very well by reviewers and voters.}}

=== Eligible work ===

Compensation requests can only be made for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;delivered work&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: work that has been available to users at the time compensation for it is being requested (see [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19 a more elaborate explanation of this notion here]). Work that’s planned or in-progress is not eligible for compensation. 

Generally, work merged to the master branch of a repository can be considered delivered (if applicable).

Reporting bugs and/or opening issues generally does not qualify as delivered work since, strictly speaking, opening an issue does not usually &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;deliver&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; anything. With that said, there are occasional exceptions to this, so as suggested above, please keep other contributors informed about what you&amp;#x27;re up to in order to minimize misunderstandings.

== Create your compensation request ==

Making a compensation request requires 2 steps:
# opening an issue on GitHub 
# submitting the compensation request to the Bisq DAO

Issuance and voting takes place on Bisq, but metadata (e.g. compensation request details) is stored on GitHub to decrease the data storage burden on the Bisq and Bitcoin networks.

If you wish to request compensation for the current cycle, please make a compensation request issue no later than one week prior to the end of the current cycle&amp;#x27;s proposal phase. This allows time for team leads to do an initial review and offer feedback. Reminders about this deadline are sent in the [[https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions|discussions area on GitHub]] and on [[https://bisq.chat|Matrix]] in the #compensation channel.

=== 1. Open a new issue ===

[[File:Github-create-cr.png|400px|thumb|left|Opening a new compensation request issue on GitHub.]]

The issue should go in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues bisq-network/compensation repository], and it should be titled in the following format:

&lt;code&gt;For Cycle N&lt;/code&gt;, where N is the number of the current cycle

You must stick to this convention in order for the compensation request parsing bot to properly parse your request.

{{Admonition_Note|Compensation requests are assumed to be ready for review as soon as they&amp;#x27;re created. If you would prefer to delay review of your request, preface your issue&amp;#x27;s title with &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; so that people (and bots) know to ignore it. Then, when your request is ready for review, just remove &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; from the issue title.}}

=== 2. List your work in the issue ===

Compensation requests must be made in a very particular format in order for them to be valid. This is because a bot is used to parse requests to automatically aggregate work done for reporting and budgeting.

The placeholder text of the issue you just opened tells you everything you need to know.
* In the &amp;quot;Summary&amp;quot; section, fill out all the numbers in brackets (&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;required&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;)
* In the &amp;quot;Contributions Delivered&amp;quot; section, list your contributions as rows in the table (&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;required&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;)
* In the &amp;quot;Contributions in Progress&amp;quot; section, list contributions you&amp;#x27;re expecting to deliver in future cycles

==== Tips on making a convincing request ====

The onus is on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;you&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to convince Bisq stakeholders what you did, how much it’s worth, and why it’s valuable. Voters will be evaluating what you put in this GitHub issue to determine whether or not you should be issued the BSQ you&amp;#x27;re asking for.

In order to make your case as strong as possible, make sure to:
* Include as many links to issues, pull requests, and other &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot; for any work you want to be compensated for
* Comments that help explain what the work is, why it is valuable, etc.
* Links to role reports, if you hold any roles in the Bisq network

As mentioned above, this is a big reason that it’s important that everything you do for Bisq be as public, documented, and verifiable as possible, and that everything you do has positive consensus with multiple stakeholders so you know you’re not wasting your time.

Even then, not all stakeholders will be familiar with your work, so it’s important to be as thorough as you can when making a compensation request so there’s enough context for those unfamiliar with your work to make an informed vote.

Feel free to check out [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed old compensation requests] if you&amp;#x27;re unsure about anything.

==== Tips on valuing your work ====

Valuing work is a judgment call. There&amp;#x27;s no precise way to go about valuing your work, but here are some pointers:
* work should be valued based on the value of the contribution you made, not on the raw time you spent on it
* if you are unsure about the value of your contribution, consider what you would charge for your work if you did it as a freelancer

Ideally, especially if you&amp;#x27;re a new contributor, consider discussing compensation for particular tasks you&amp;#x27;re working on with another contributor who&amp;#x27;s been around longer to see if your expectations align with theirs. You can also browse older requests for examples of what people in the past were paid for similar work.

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Submit your GitHub issue and address feedback ==

Upon submitting your compensation request issue (or removing &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; from the title), a bot will parse it to evaluate formatting. If it&amp;#x27;s not valid, the bot will add a &lt;code&gt;parsed:invalid&lt;/code&gt; label to the issue and leave a comment with a reason. Please edit your issue until the bot adds a &lt;code&gt;parsed:valid&lt;/code&gt; label.

Also shortly after you submit your issue, a human team lead will review it and offer feedback. Upon addressing feedback, the team lead will advise submitting your request to the Bisq DAO.

One exception: if your compensation proposal consists solely of pre-approved roles items for ops, you can skip awaiting feedback from team leads (see https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/ops/discussions/1 for reference).

{{Admonition_Note|[[Compensation#Team_Lead|Team lead reviews]] are not final or binding. But their feedback serves as an important signal to voters, so a favorable indication from them is important.}}

== Submit your request as a DAO proposal ==

Once a team lead has given you the go-ahead, it&amp;#x27;s time to submit your request to the DAO.

In Bisq, go to &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Dao-cr.png|600px|thumb|left|Submitting a compensation request to the DAO.]]

# Select &amp;quot;Compensation request&amp;quot; in the dropdown menu
# Specify your GitHub handle, exactly like it is on GitHub
# Replace the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; with the number of your GitHub issue (for example, if your compensation request’s GitHub URL is https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/999, the URL in your DAO compensation request should be https://bisq.network/dao-compensation/999. Don’t copy the GitHub link directly—it won’t work!)
# Specify the amount of BSQ you&amp;#x27;re requesting

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

{{Admonition_Note|Bisq may not use GitHub forever. But the Bitcoin blockchain is forever, and proposal URLs cannot be changed—the Bitcoin transaction corresponding to a Bisq DAO proposal includes a hash of the proposal’s data object, which includes the proposal URL. This is why Bisq proposals require a URL with a domain name that Bisq controls: if proposal data ever needs to be migrated, the links can remain the same.}}

When you’re ready, click &lt;code&gt;Make proposal&lt;/code&gt; to confirm your proposal for voting in the current cycle. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Proposal data cannot be edited, so make sure everything is correct.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=== Fees and other costs ===

A compensation request is a type of proposal, and proposals cost a fee to make in the Bisq DAO. Currently that fee is 2 BSQ. Since a compensation request is intended to issue new BSQ, you’ll also need to include a small amount of bitcoin to be colored into BSQ if your proposal is accepted—100 satoshis × [requested BSQ amount]. See more details in the [[DAO_user_reference#Proposal_Phase|User Reference]]. 

Also remember that Bisq DAO proposals are Bitcoin transactions, so it costs mining fees and takes time for them to be confirmed. Consider watching mining fees to broadcast your proposal at a reasonable cost. Waiting until late in the proposal phase to submit may cause it to not be confirmed in time.

{{Admonition_Note|If you need to make a change, you can delete the proposal and make a new one while the proposal phase is still active, but you’ll need to pay the proposal fee again. Once the proposal phase is over, proposals cannot be added or removed until the next proposal phase.}}

The BSQ and BTC is automatically added to your proposal transaction by Bisq, but the BTC needs to be in your Bisq BTC wallet at the time you submit your proposal. Keep in mind that you’ll also need some BSQ and BTC for the other phases (vote &amp;amp; vote reveal).

When you successfully submit your proposal in the DAO, it’ll propagate across the Bisq peer-to-peer network and be ready for stakeholders to vote on in the voting phase. If your request is approved, you will see the BSQ you requested in your wallet after the voting phase is over.</text></revision></page><page><title>Contributor checklist</title><ns>0</ns><id>405</id><revision><id>3694</id><timestamp>2024-08-25T16:32:52Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

# Subscribe to the [https://lists.bisq.network/listinfo/bisq-contrib bisq-contrib] mailing list for low-frequency, high-priority contributor communications.

If you decide to proceed and start contributing, you&amp;#x27;ll want to join Bisq&amp;#x27;s GitHub organization so you can be assigned to issues:

# Request an invite to the [https://github.com/bisq-network @bisq-network GitHub organization] on Matrix. An admin will get you set up. Doing this makes it possible to add you to the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams @bisq-network/contributors] team and to assign you to GitHub issues.
# After accepting your GitHub invitation, consider changing your [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/people membership visibility] from &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;. This helps others know at a glance roughly how many contributors are involved with Bisq.

== Do valuable work and get compensated ==

After browsing GitHub repositories and Matrix discussions, you will start to develop a sense for what&amp;#x27;s happening, what&amp;#x27;s needed, and where you can help:

# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Find a problem somewhere in Bisq-land&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that (a) needs fixing and (b) is a match for your skills and interests. Browse critical bugs, open bounties, follow chats on Matrix and the forums, and ask around about what other contributors think needs fixing. 
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Get assigned to an issue&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or have your initiative acknowledged in some other way. While you don’t strictly need anybody’s permission to do anything for Bisq, you’ll want to make sure there&amp;#x27;s buy-in from other contributors so your work is received well. Otherwise, there are no guarantees that your work will be merged, reviewed, or eligible for compensation.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do work to fix that problem&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Submit your fix for review with a pull request (for code and documentation changes) or with a GitHub issue (for everything else).
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Request that others review your work&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The best way to do this is by writing good commit comments and pull request/issue descriptions that clearly explain the problem your work is intended to solve, why it’s important, and why you fixed it the way you did. Make it as easy as possible for others to review your work. Make it a pleasure for others to review your work.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Incorporate review feedback&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; you get until your fix gets merged or is otherwise accepted.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Repeat&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; steps 1–5.
# [[compensation|Submit a compensation request]] toward the end of the cycle.

{{Admonition Note|As you&amp;#x27;ll see from browsing the various repositories on GitHub, changes to Bisq are almost always discussed publicly. This helps maintain Bisq&amp;#x27;s commitment to transparency, invites feedback to improve the quality of contributions, and it helps keep compensation honest. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Always try to make sure your work is documented somewhere so others can follow its progress and offer feedback.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;}}

Ultimately, please remember that all Bisq contributors participate on a voluntary basis, and the more energy and quality you bring to the table, the more existing contributors will be encouraged to pay you attention.

Regarding development, keep in mind that reviewing other contributors&amp;#x27; work can be highly valuable as well (both to the project, and also to yourself as a way to learn how Bisq works). Quality code reviews are eligible for compensation just like any other contribution.

== Consider if you would like to become a Burning Man ==

For contributors wanting to receive regular bitcoin payments they may consider becoming performing a role as one of the Bisq [[Burning Men]]. It would be worth Bisq contributors understanding the pros and cons to becoming a burning man to decide if it is something they would like to do.</text></revision></page><page><title>DAO technical overview</title><ns>0</ns><id>225</id><revision><id>2140</id><timestamp>2021-04-09T13:37:39Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

In this &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;technical overview&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, you will see:
* what BSQ tokens actually are, how they’re created, and how they’re destroyed
* the various functions of the Bisq DAO and how BSQ enables them

Several example transactions are included so you can explicitly see the processes.

== BSQ token ==

BSQ is a colored coin based on Bitcoin. One BSQ is represented by 100 bitcoin satoshis.

The colored coin concept does not require OpReturn data but uses the transaction graph to determine if a tx output originates in either the genesis tx or an issuance transaction.

BSQ inherits all the transaction rules from Bitcoin and adds some additional rules. Even though BSQ transactions do not require &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt;, it will be used for certain specialized transactions (voting, compensation requests, etc). Aside from the ancestry to the genesis or an issuance transaction, there is another important rule: the outputs are parsed in a way that the first outputs are interpreted as BSQ as long there is sufficient BSQ value available from the inputs. So the order of BSQ and BTC outputs is essential! For inputs the order is irrelevant. Any violation of those rules would make BSQ invalid. There are many more details which are not currently covered in this document.

We use the Bisq P2P network as a carrier for content-rich data like that of proposals or voting. The blockchain is used for timestamping that data. Both the P2P network data and the tx are linked together and are used for creating network consensus.

BSQ is a result of blockchain-related data and P2P network data.

== Infrastructure ==

The Bisq DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data as well as on data from the Bisq P2P network. Each Bisq application verifies the rules of the DAO. The degree of trust to data delivered from other nodes can be determined by the user. Running a full DAO node requires running bitcoind with RPC enabled. The DAO state can be rebuilt from the genesis transaction. The only remaining trusted entity are then the seed nodes which deliver past P2P network data. As seed node operators are bonded, risk for abuse is very limited. There are (at the moment) 8 seed nodes and all need to be in consensus on P2P network data. The user can see the consensus in the application (Network Monitor tab).

=== Nodes ===

A user can decide to run the application as lite node or full node. By default it runs as lite node as that does not require any additional setup.

==== Full nodes ====

A fully-validating BSQ node requires a Bitcoin Core node to verify blockchain data. RPC is used for communication. Setup details are in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dao-setup.md source code documentation].

Full nodes receive a notification from Bitcoin Core at each new block, scan the block for BSQ transactions and broadcast those to the Bisq P2P network. Every transaction with any BSQ input or output (issuance) is considered a BSQ transaction. The full node also listens to network messages from lite nodes which request BSQ blocks from a certain block height. The full node sends back the list of all blocks since the requested height. The bandwidth requirements for this will depend on the number of BSQ transactions, but rough estimations suggest that there will be no considerable issues. Bisq seed nodes are used as full nodes since those are the first nodes to which a user gets connected and we can use the existing connection to transmit the additional data early in the startup process.

==== Lite nodes ====

Most users will likely operate in lite node mode. They have to trust the seed node operators that they are not all colluding and holding data back. If at least one operator is honest the lite node can detect a conflict and would re-validate each block from the last snapshot or even from the genesis block. The UI will notify the user about conflicting data from seed nodes.

At startup, a lite node requests the missing BSQ blocks from the seed node and then validates those blocks to achieve a local state of valid and unspent BSQ outputs. In case of chain splits it can be that one of the seed nodes is on another chain and conflicting blocks get propagated. This would trigger a re-validation of all blocks from the latest snapshot for the lite node. The last received block would be considered the current state but the user will see a message saying there are conflicts (and that  it is recommended to wait for more than one confirmation before considering a BSQ transaction as valid). Only after all full nodes (seed nodes) have the same state again will the lite node exit the &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot; state. If the user waits for a sufficiently high number of confirmations (4-6) he will not risk that his validation was based on an orphaned chain and that he could become victim of a double spend.

=== Seed nodes ===

Seed nodes act as providers for P2P network data and filtered blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain for lite nodes. When a node starts, it requests all P2P network data from several seed nodes.

=== External DAO monitor ===

Monitoring of DAO-related data and infrastructure will be added to [https://monitor.bisq.network/ Bisq monitoring]. This should help us spot any potential consensus or network conflict early.

This is not deployed at the moment, but will be integrated soon.

=== BSQ block explorer ===

[https://explorer.bisq.network/ BSQ block explorers] show all BSQ transactions with some metadata (transaction type, etc). It gives also some statistical data about the network. It is a very basic version at the moment, but we are working on a more sophisticated version. Any BSQ transaction can be looked up in a normal Bitcoin block explorer as well, but of course those explorers will not show any DAO-related context. If looking up a BSQ address on a normal Bitcoin block explorer, a user needs to remove the &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; prefix so the address is considered a valid BTC address.

== BSQ integration in Bisq ==

The Bisq DAO and BSQ are fully integrated into the Bisq UI. It comes with a BSQ wallet and UI for creating proposals, participating in voting, and taking part in other DAO functions.

=== Wallet ===

The Bisq application provides an integrated BSQ wallet with basic features for receiving and sending BSQ, as well as a transaction history screen. The wallet is based on [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki BIP 44] and uses [https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md registered coin type 142]. This provides extra protection against the risk of accidentally using the BSQ wallet as a BTC wallet (e.g., when restoring from seed words). To avoid users from needing to backup 2 different sets of seed words, we use the same seed for both the BSQ and the BTC wallets, even though they are stored in different files. To further avoid mixing BSQ with normal Bitcoin, we use a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; as address prefix for BSQ addresses in the user interface. Internally that prefix does not exist, as a BSQ address is a normal BTC address, and BSQ transactions are normal BTC transactions.

BSQ token transactions and balances are represented inside the application but there is also a web-based [https://explorer.bisq.network/ BSQ block explorer].

A BSQ transaction is valid only after a blockchain confirmation. However, for better usability, we allow users to spend their own change outputs. This involves no risk, as a user would render all follow-up transactions invalid if he tries to double-spend. Unconfirmed BSQ received from others is not spendable.

=== Application internal DAO monitor ===

Inside the application we maintain a hash chain of states and P2P network data. The overall DAO state gets hashed at each new block which contains the previous hash, thus forming a chain of hashes. If the last hash is correct, all the previous must be correct as well. Each node receives the last 10 hashes from seed nodes and compares it with its local hash. If there is any conflict, it shows a warning and requests to rebuild the DAO state. At each new block, each peer broadcasts its local hash to its neighbors. That way, the node also receives hashes from normal peers.

Similar to DAO states, we also maintain a hash chain for proposal data and blind vote data. These hashes are created only once per voting cycle at an appropriate block height (i.e., when it is expected that the whole network has received all data).

There are valid cases when consensus could be temporarily broken. In case of a chain split, nodes can have different DAO states, as the Bitcoin block hash is part of the data, and if 2 nodes are on a different chain they will have different block hashes.

In case some P2P network data was not distributed well in the network, there may be temporary conflicts of the relevant hash chains. An application restart should usually resolve such issues. If not, rebuilding the DAO state forces all P2P network data to be reloaded.

=== Snapshots ===

To avoid reevaluating all history at each startup, we use a snapshot mechanism.

Every 20 blocks a snapshot mechanism is triggered. The current state is cloned and kept in memory, and if a previous clone exists, it is persisted. At the next snapshot trigger event, the last clone is persisted and a new clone is cached. In this way, the snapshot is always at least 20 blocks old.

The lite node requests the blocks since the latest snapshot only, so that will usually be 20-40 blocks (maximum). The only exception to this is on first startup after a new install, when a lite node only has the snapshot shipped with the binary—in this case, requested blocks might consume a bit more bandwidth.

If we maintain a monthly release schedule, there can be about 4500 blocks in a month, but even with that we expect not more than 1-5 MB of bandwidth to receive the initial blockchain data.

=== Snapshots shipped in releases ===

Each application release is updated with a recent snapshot version of the DAO state. This data will be used for new users who have not created their own snapshot yet. This saves new users from needing to download all historical data and rebuilding DAO state from genesis.

The user still can rebuild from genesis if he does not want to trust that developers have shipped a correct snapshot. Any discrepancy would be easily detected.

== Blockchain-related data ==

One part of the DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data. We only use the blockchain for timestamping. Transactions do not carry content-rich data—this data is stored on the Bisq P2P network.

List of possible BSQ transaction types:

* Genesis tx
* Transfer BSQ tx
* Trade fee tx
* Proposal tx
* Compensation request tx
* Reimbursement request tx
* Blind vote tx
* Vote reveal tx
* Lockup tx
* Unlock tx
* Asset listing fee tx
* Proof of burn tx

In addition, a transaction can be unverified, invalid or irregular.

Unverified is the default state for all unconfirmed BSQ transactions. Validation is done once a tx is confirmed.

Invalid transactions are transactions which have violated validation rules. BSQ are destroyed in such transactions.

Irregular transactions are transactions which are invalid with their intended use but have not destroyed their BSQ. An example is a proposal tx which got confirmed too late (not in proposal phase) and therefore is invalid as a proposal tx, but the BSQ is still valid to be spent.

=== Genesis tx ===

BTC from the donation address was used to fund the input for the genesis tx. The genesis tx issued 3,657,480 BSQ, which is equivalent to 3.65748 BTC. The amount of 3,657,480 BSQ is the sum of the 2,500,000 BSQ which was distributed as symbolic [https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/2f194230e23459a9211322c4b1c182cf3f367086e8059aca2f8f44e20dac527a testnet BSQ] to past contributors back in July 2017 and 1,157,480 BSQ contributors have earned since starting [https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html Phase Zero] in October 2017.

The outputs are the BSQ addresses of all contributors who have contributed to Bisq before we start the DAO on mainnet. All outputs are by definition valid BSQ. The genesis tx is funded with the exact amount, including the miner fee, so there is no change output.

=== Transfer BSQ tx ===

Sending BSQ to another address is a simple transaction without OpReturn. It requires a BSQ input for the transferred BSQ as well as a BTC input to cover the miner fee. The outputs are the receiver&amp;#x27;s BSQ address, an optional BSQ change output, and an optional BTC change output.

A transaction to send 10 BSQ could look like this:

* Input 1: 30.00 BSQ (BSQ sender)
* Input 2: 0.01 BTC (required BTC for mining fee)
* Output 1: 10.00 BSQ (BSQ receiver)
* Output 1: 20.00 BSQ (BSQ change output back to sender)
* Output 2: 0.0095 BTC (BTC change output)
* Mining fee: 0.0005

=== Trade fee tx ===

We invalidate a small amount of BSQ for the trade fee payment. Since the burned amount is used as miner fee and not
as a regular tx output, we are not restricted by the dust limit of 546 satoshis, and can spend fees as little as 0.01 BSQ (equivalent to 1 BTC satoshi). The fee is the difference of the BSQ input and the BSQ output.

A BSQ trade fee payment tx could look like this (for a fee with 0.5 BSQ):

* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 9.50 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.09950050 BTC change output
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049950 BTC + 0.00000050 BTC or 0.50 BSQ)

In this case, we only used 9.50 BSQ of the 10.00 BSQ from the input. Since the second output is spending more than the remaining 0.50 BSQ, it is an invalid BSQ output so we consider it a BTC output. The remaining 0.50 BSQ which was not used in the first output will be used for the mining fee, thus reducing the mining fee which is paid from the BTC input (input 2).

=== Proposal tx ===

A proposal transaction contains an OpReturn output which indicates the type and carries the hash of the
proposal payload data.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x10
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of proposal payload

The hash is created from the bytes of the proposal payload with tx ID set to null using protobuffer serialization.
It is first hashed with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160 to get a 20 byte hash.

Example with a 2 BSQ fee:

* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 8 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.09950200 BTC change output
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Compensation request tx/Reimbursement request tx ===

Compensation request tx and reimbursement request txs are technically the same and inherit the properties of a
proposal tx but have some additional requirements. They add a BTC output which will be interpreted as a BSQ output at the vote result phase in case the request is accepted by voting.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs BSQ issuance and miner fee
* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)
* Outputs [1]: Issuance candidate output; before voted ok it is BTC afterwards newly issued BSQ
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Outputs [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: Compensation request tx: 0x11 / Reimbursement request: 0x12
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of request payload

Example with a 2 BSQ fee and requested issuance amount of 5000 BSQ:

* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 8 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.00500000 BTC (5000 BSQ after positive voting)
* Output 3: 0.09950200 BTC change output
* Output 4: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Blind vote tx ===

The blind vote tx contains the hash of the blind vote payload and uses the vote stake as input. The stake is blocked from spending during this phase and is only unlocked by the vote reveal tx. If another transaction spends the stake, the blind vote becomes invalid. The blind vote requires a fee in BSQ.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee + stake
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output of stake
* Output [0-1] Optional BSQ change output
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x13
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of encrypted votes

To create the encrypted votes we use following data:

* Secret key: 128 bit AES key.
* List of a tuple of proposal Tx IDs + vote, sorted by tx ID. Only valid proposals of current cycle are included.

We use protobuffer serialisation for the bytes which will be encrypted with the secret key.

Example with a 2 BSQ fee and 7000 BSQ vote stake:

* Input 1: 8000.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 7000 BSQ / 0.00700000 BTC
* Output 2: 998 BSQ change output
* Output 3: 0.09950200 BTC change output
* Output 4: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Vote reveal tx ===

The vote reveal tx consumes the stake output from the blind vote tx as the only BSQ input. It does not require a BSQ fee.

In the OpReturn data we add the secret key for decrypting our blind vote and a hash of the blind vote list to ensure consensus of the P2P network data used in voting. This hash will be used in the vote result phase to determine a majority in case different users get a different list of blind votes, which would lead to different vote results, and therefore cause consensus failures.

* Input [1]: BSQ input -&gt; stake output of blind vote tx
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: BSQ output (unlocked stake)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x14
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of blind vote list
* 16 bytes secretKey

The hash of the blind vote list is made using all blind vote payload data received in the cycle and sorted by blind vote tx ID.
The secretKey is the encoded byte representation of the secret key.

Example with 7000 BSQ stake:

* Input 1: 7000 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 7000 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Lockup tx ===

The lock tx can be use for locking up funds for a bonded role or for bonded reputation: a certain amount of BSQ is locked for a defined lock time (in blocks). Only an unlock tx can unlock locked funds. Once the unlock tx is confirmed, the lock time will be used to determine when the funds can be used in a normal transaction again. While funds are locked, they cannot be moved, or they are invalidated. While funds are locked, or are in an unlocking state, funds can be confiscated by voting.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: Locked up BSQ
* Outputs [0-1]: BSQ change output
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x15
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 1 byte for lockup reason (bonded role 0x01, reputation 0x02)
* 2 bytes for lock time (see: bisq.common.util.Utilities.integerToByteArray for encoding)
* 20 bytes for hash

The hash in case of a bonded role is created from immutable data of the bonded role. Currently we use hashCode but that should be changed to a cryptographic hash.
The hash for a reputation is derived from a salt. The salt is by default a random string as hex or can be any string defined by the user.

Example with locking up 4000 BSQ:

* Input 1: 6000 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 4000 BSQ lockup
* Output 1: 2000 BSQ change output
* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Unlock tx ===

The unlock tx takes the lockup tx output and use the lock time encoded in the OpReturn to determine the unlock time.
The BSQ output cannot be used in another tx until the lock time is over. During that time it is in the unlocking state.
Afterwards it is in the unlocked state and can be spent like any normal BSQ output.

* Input [1]: BSQ input from lockup tx lockup output (output index 0)
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: BSQ unlock output
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee

Example with unlocking 4000 BSQ:

* Input 1: 4000 BSQ (from lockup tx output)
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 4000 BSQ unlocking/unlocked state
* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Asset listing fee tx ===

The asset listing fee tx is used for paying listing fees for an asset. The ticker symbol of the asset is specified in the OpReturn data to bind the tx to a specific asset.
If the BSQ fee is more than the required mining fee, we do not use a BTC input, and add the remaining BTC to the BTC output.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for listing fee
* Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - fee)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x16
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of ticker symbol

We take the bytes of the ticker symbol as UTF-8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.

Example with a BSQ fee of 20 BSQ:

* Input 1: 100.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 80 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.0997 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)

=== Proof of burn tx ===

A user can put the hash of an arbitrary string (pre-image) into a proof of burn tx and burn a specified amount of
BSQ. He can later use the pre-image to prove to any party that he has created that hash. He can also sign any challenge
message and the challenger can verify that he is the key holder of the first input used in that tx.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for burned amount
* Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - burned amount)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x16
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of pre image

We take the bytes of the pre-image as UTF-8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.

Example with 20 BSQ burned:

* Input 1: 100.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 80 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.0997 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)

== P2P network payloads ==

Proposals and blind vote data are published over the Bisq P2P network. They must be published in the correct phase and cycle, otherwise they are considered invalid. Each node listens for these messages and persists the data locally. At startup, each node receives missing data from seed nodes. The corresponding tx ID is part of the data and is used to map the data to the transaction. The hash of the P2P network data is part of the OpReturn data in the transactions. In this way, we can verify that the mapping of a tx to the data is correct in both directions.

=== Temporary proposal payload ===

During the proposal phase the user can add and remove proposals. For removing we use the public key which was added when publishing a proposal and verify with a signature if the remove attempt is coming from the same owner. This is the same model as we use in other P2P network data like offer payloads. The data has a time to live of 60 days, and after that, it is removed from local storage.

=== Proposal payload ===

There are several different types of proposals:

* Compensation request
* Reimbursement requests
* Proposal for changing a parameter
* Proposal for a bonded role
* Proposal for confiscating a bond
* Generic proposal
* Proposal for removing an asset

The proposal contains the tx ID of the proposal transaction. When creating the transaction we add the 20-byte hash of
the proposal data to the OpReturn data of the proposal tx. As the tx ID would be part of the proposal data and cannot be
known before the tx is created, we leave it empty and set it afterwards. That way we get a mapping in both directions and
can verify later that a proposal payload has a valid tx and that the tx data matches the proposal data.

During the break after the proposal phase, all nodes publish their proposal payload, which uses proposals from the temporary
proposal payload. This data is now immutable and will be used for voting.

=== Blind vote payload ===

Blind vote data are published when the user makes his blind vote tx and are managed in the same way as proposal payloads (append-only data).

== Governance ==

Governances takes place in regularly-occurring voting cycles. A cycle consists of 4 distinct phases.

=== Phases ===

Phases are defined by block height. Each phase is separated with a break to avoid issues with reorgs.

Here are the phases and the initial duration values (they can be changed by voting):

* Proposal phase (compensation requests, etc): 3600 blocks, about 25 days
* Break: 150 blocks
* Blind vote phase (approve/decline proposals): 450 blocks, about 3 days
* Break: 10 blocks
* Vote reveal phase: 450 blocks, about 3 days
* Break: 10 blocks
* Result phase: 10 blocks

The full cycle will last 4680 blocks which is about one month if one block takes an average of 10 minutes.

==== Proposal phase ====

Any BSQ stakeholder can publish a temporary proposal payload during the proposal phase, as well as remove their own proposals.

==== Blind Vote phase ====

A BSQ stakeholder can vote on any proposal with 3 options: accept, decline or ignore. Not voting on a proposal is the same as ignoring it.

The user defines how much _stake_ they want to put into their vote. The higher the stake, the higher the vote weight compared to other voters. In addition to the stake, _merit_ is added if the user has earned BSQ in previous cycles through accepted compensation requests. The merit value of each issuance ages linearly over time: it reaches 0 after 100 000 blocks (about 2 years). Aged accumulated merit is automatically added to the stake, and the sum of both is the vote weight.

When creating the blind vote tx, the user also publishes the blind vote payload. We use the same linking of tx ID and payload hash to map them together.

==== Vote reveal phase ====

Upon entering the vote reveal phase, each voter automatically publishes their vote reveal tx. There is no fee required for this transaction beside the miner fee. No P2P network data is published.

==== Vote result phase ====

In the vote result phase, all nodes calculate the vote result on all proposals and apply the result to the overall BSQ state.

This process uses the hash of the blind vote list from the vote reveal tx to determine the winning majority, in case users had different P2P network payloads of blind votes. The majority is calculated by stake (not merit) of the voters. Only if at least 80% of the network has the same hash is the cycle is valid, otherwise, all proposals and requests are considered rejected.

A proposal is considered accepted if the required quorum and threshold are reached. Quorum is the minimum amount of accumulated vote weight in BSQ which is required. Threshold is the relationship of accepted votes to total votes. Each proposal type has different quorum and threshold parameters which can be changed by voting, but threshold can never be below 50.01%.

In case a proposal&amp;#x27;s data is not available, it is rejected. In case there are 2 accepted change parameter proposals for changing the same parameter to 2 different values, we reject both as it shows there is a social consensus issue in the DAO.

=== DAO Parameters ===

There are many different parameters which can be changed by voting.
Trading fees, voting parameters (threshold and quorum), durations of the phases, and many more.

See the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/3854907c14357680038661c8153095a157efbc5d/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/governance/param/Param.java Param class] for a complete list.

=== Bonded roles ===

All roles in the Bisq DAO which can potentially create severe damage are handled as bonded roles. To become a role owner one need to make a request for a bonded role, and once accepted by voting, the person needs to lock up the defined bond. The role only is only considered active when the bond is locked up.

The required amount for the bond is defined in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/497e202420940372fa1a344f64d375eac710d299/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/state/model/governance/BondedRoleType.java BondedRoleType enum]. The unlock time is 110 days for all roles.

In severe cases, BSQ stakeholders can make a proposal to confiscate a bond. This will require a very high threshold in voting and is considered an exceptional case which hopefully never happens.

Most bonded roles are connected to environments which cannot interact with the Bisq DAO directly. For example, the Github Admin role cannot be revoked by confiscating the role owner as the Bisq DAO has no power over GitHub. The only exceptions are mediators and arbitrators, since people can be verified as valid bonded role owners before they are used for dispute resolution. This is not implemented yet and will be part of the new trade protocol update in the next few months.

=== Bonded reputation ===

Similar to bonded roles, a user can lock up a bond to prove reputation. There is no concrete use case for this in Bisq at the moment, but we might use it in the future for new forms of trade protocols which are based on bonded reputation.

=== Asset listing fee ===

Assets added to Bisq need to gain enough traders to reach a minimum trade volume over a certain time period. These parameters are DAO parameters and can be changed by voting. If an asset does not satisfy these parameters, such as trading volume thresholds, it will be removed from the list of assets when creating an altcoin payment account or selecting the preferred currencies in the software preferences.

Anyone can pay a fee in BSQ to gain access to a trial period where requirements to reach trade volume thresholds are lifted. Usually the coin issuers do this, but it can be done by anyone interested in trading a particular asset. The fee is initially 1 BSQ per day for a trial period, with a minimum of 30 days. The fee can be changed by voting.

If an asset gets removed by a &lt;code&gt;Remove Asset Proposal&lt;/code&gt;, it can no longer be reactivated by the listing fee. Listing fees already paid are lost in this case.

=== Proof of burn ===

This advanced feature does not have a concrete use at the moment, but might be used in the future. Burning BSQ can be used as a form of reputation. If one is willing to burn some money, and can use that proof for other activities (e.g. securing a trade), they might be interested that this form of reputation by burning BSQ will not become pointless in case he was publicly proven as scammer. The user can prove that he was the originator of the transaction by providing the pre-image to a hash, which gets added to the OpReturn data and he can sign any challenge message to prove he had funded the transaction. We use the EC key from the first input for the signature.

== Disclaimer ==

This document does not cover all details and cannot be used as basis for implementation of BSQ features or for
creating self-crafted transactions. The source code is the only real specification. It is NOT recommended to create custom BSQ transactions, as tiny mistakes can lead to destroyed BSQ. Bisq developers will not be concerned with transactions which might be valid with the current rule set but which have not been created by the Bisq application. In the future, updated rules might become more strict and might break such externally-created transactions. Requirements for backward compatibility will only consider use cases and tx structures created by the Bisq application.

Please note that currently it is not recommended to send BSQ to a hardware wallet. Handling the miner fee might cause invalidation of the BSQ funds or cause losses if precious BSQ is used to pay the miner fee. We will publish some instructions how to do this in a safe way soon.</text></revision></page><page><title>Compensation</title><ns>0</ns><id>33</id><revision><id>3680</id><timestamp>2024-08-25T15:47:25Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Compensation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is an important element of the [[Decentralized_autonomous_organization|Bisq DAO]] that incentivizes people to contribute to the Bisq software and, over time, enables them to take on a greater stake in its governance.

This article covers the several parties involved in the process of requesting, approving, issuing, and guiding compensation.

__TOC__

== Compensation Maintainer ==

The compensation maintainer oversees the day-to-day process of compensation requests, triages issues, and determines rates. 

See the [[Compensation Maintainer]] article for more details on this role.

== Contributor ==

Contributors are welcome to create compensation requests for work they&amp;#x27;ve done on the Bisq project. See instructions in [[Making_a_compensation_request|this guide]].

If you&amp;#x27;d like to contribute to Bisq but are unsure where to start, check out the [[contributor checklist]].

== Burning Men ==

Any contributor can also act as Burning Man. This is part of Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralized [[Burning Men]] protocol. Contributors to Bisq can choose to burn the BSQ they receive to have a chance of receive bitcoin trade fees paid by traders. The process of burning BSQ also help strengthen the DAO by decreasing the BSQ supply.

== Stakeholder ==

Just as stakeholders may review and vote on any DAO proposal, stakeholders may review and vote on any contributor&amp;#x27;s compensation request. After all, compensation requests are merely another type of DAO proposal. 

No special permissions are needed—a stakeholder can simply add feedback in the form of a comment on a compensation request or an emoji reaction (thumbs-up, thumbs-down, confused face, etc).

There is no obligation for stakeholders to perform these reviews, but it&amp;#x27;s advised to only review compensation requests that you are knowledgeable about.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

This article documents the project management process used within the Bisq DAO.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of the project management process is to ensure we:

* work on what&amp;#x27;s most important,
* finish what we start,
* stay within our budget, and
* don&amp;#x27;t spread ourselves too thin.

== Philosophy ==

=== Most work is project work ===

Many efforts under the Bisq DAO require multiple tasks to be carried out by multiple contributors, possibly across multiple [[:Category:Teams|teams]] and a span of time. Such efforts are best managed as &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;projects&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; having a beginning and an end, with clear criteria for delivery and a strong owner who takes responsibility for its success.

=== Identifying candidate projects ===

Good examples of candidate projects include:

* Adding a new feature or making a major enhancement to the Bisq client
* Introducing a new process within the Bisq DAO or significantly changing an existing one

Non-examples include:

* Typo fixes
* Minor enhancements and bug fixes
* Carrying out the regular duties of a given [[Roles|role]]

It is ultimately a judgement call whether a given effort should be managed as a project. Here are a few rules of thumb:

* Does it require multiple tasks? It&amp;#x27;s probably a project.
* Does it require people other than yourself to take action? It&amp;#x27;s probably a project.
* Does it require documentation and/or promotion to make sure people know about it? It&amp;#x27;s probably a project.

Work that starts out as a single task may evolve to become a project, and that&amp;#x27;s fine. But by thinking ahead a little, we can often identify projects up front and better manage them as a result.

=== Good project management scales ===

A primary goal of the project management process is to help the DAO scale. We want many contributors collaborating on many efforts in parallel with minimal management. To achieve this, the process must have a bottom-up aspect in which any contributor can propose a project and any stakeholder can participate in approving it, and it must also have a top-down aspect for allocating budget to the most important projects. The approach laid out here is designed to strike that balance.

== Roles and teams ==

=== Project owner ===

A project owner:

* is responsible for the delivery of a given project
* is usually the same contributor that proposes the project
* attends review meetings and reports on the project(s) they are responsible for

=== Stakeholders and users ===

DAO [[stakeholder|stakeholders]] and Bisq users are responsible for providing approval feedback on project proposals.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;Committee&amp;quot;&gt;
=== Project management committee ===

The [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/pmc @bisq-network/pmc] is responsible for the overall project management process, including:

* triaging new project proposals
* accepting or rejecting proposals per stakeholder approval
* leading project review calls

=== Team leads ===

[https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/team-leads @bisq-network/team-leads] are responsible for prioritizing accepted projects by allocating budget to them.

=== Contributors ===

Contributors are responsible for performing the tasks necessary to deliver a project.

== Resources ==

=== Projects repository ===

Projects are managed as GitHub Issues at https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues. The [https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project-proposal.md issue template] there defines what a well-formed project proposal should include.

=== Project boards ===

An approved project may have its own dedicated project board at https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/projects for the purpose of tracking individual tasks. Otherwise, tasks may be tracked as simple checkboxes in the project issue description or by whatever means the project owner sees fit (e.g. an external kanban board); in general, however, it is preferred that everything is managed within GitHub Issues.

=== Master projects board ===

The master projects board is available at https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/projects/3 and provides an overview of all projects and their status.

== Process ==

=== Overview ===

Anyone may &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;propose&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; a project so long as they are prepared to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;own&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; it. Each new proposal goes through &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;triage&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and, if &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;well-formed&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, moves on to stakeholder &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;approval&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; where it is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;accepted&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;rejected&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; on its merits. An accepted project is allocated &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;budget&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; according to its priority and is subject to regular &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;review&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; until the project is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;closed&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; as &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;delivered&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;aborted&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

=== Proposal ===

To create a well-formed project proposal:

# Create a [https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/new/choose new issue in the projects repository]
# Choose the &lt;code&gt;Project proposal&lt;/code&gt; issue template
# Adhere to the format of the template and fill out its content according to the instructions within

New project proposal issues are automatically labeled as &lt;code&gt;a:proposal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;needs:triage&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Triage ===

A member of the project management committee will add each new project proposal to the &lt;code&gt;Backlog&lt;/code&gt; column of the master projects board and assess whether it is well-formed according to the issue template.

If a proposal is well-formed, the triager will:
* remove the &lt;code&gt;needs:triage&lt;/code&gt; label,
* add the &lt;code&gt;needs:approval&lt;/code&gt; label and
* add a corresponding comment.

If a proposal is not well-formed, the triager will:
* add the &lt;code&gt;needs:info&lt;/code&gt; label and a comment asking the submitter to provide the missing information, or
* add the &lt;code&gt;was:invalid&lt;/code&gt; label and close the issue immediately with a corresponding comment.

=== Approval ===

Like any DAO [[proposals|proposal]], anyone may add comments providing feedback on a project proposal and may react to the proposal issue description with thumbs-up, thumbs-down or confused face emoji to indicate whether they believe the project should be approved. The goal is to arrive at a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus rough consensus] whether to approve the project. 

Taking a project proposal through formal stakeholder [[Proposals#Submit_to_the_DAO_.28if_needed.29|voting]] should be avoided unless there is significant contention.

Once consensus has been achieved, a member of the project management committee will:

* remove the &lt;code&gt;a:proposal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;needs:approval&lt;/code&gt; labels
* add the &lt;code&gt;has:approval&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;was:rejected&lt;/code&gt; label as appropriate
* add a comment indicating the status change
* close the issue if rejected

=== Budgeting ===

Acceptance of a project is distinct from allocating budget to it. Acceptance indicates that a project is worth doing; allocating budget indicates that a project &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;has priority.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Team leads are responsible for reviewing accepted projects and adding the &lt;code&gt;has:budget&lt;/code&gt; label when budget has been allocated.

=== Work ===

==== Starting work ====

Work may be started at any time on a project, even prior to approval and budgeting, but contributors should have no expectation of cooperation or compensation until the project has both.

In any case, when work starts, the project owner should move the project to the &lt;code&gt;In progress&lt;/code&gt; column of the master projects board and add a corresponding comment.

If work is being resumed after a period of inactivity, the project owner should also remove any labels such as &lt;code&gt;is:blocked&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;is:stalled&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Stopping work ====

When work stops for an extended period the project owner should move the project issue to the &lt;code&gt;Backlog&lt;/code&gt; column with a corresponding comment. If the project is blocked in some way, the &lt;code&gt;is:blocked&lt;/code&gt; label should be applied. If work has stalled due to inactivity, the &lt;code&gt;is:stalled&lt;/code&gt; label should be applied.

==== Requesting help ====

If a project cannot progress because a certain skill set is not available within the current team of contributors, the project owner should add the &lt;code&gt;needs:help&lt;/code&gt; label with a corresponding comment that explains what kind of help is needed.

=== Review ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;UPDATE:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; These bi-weekly calls may not be the way to go. We might end up doing things more asynchronously through issue comments and perhaps a once-a-month project review call. See https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/182#issuecomment-621167017 for ongoing discussion.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Approved projects are subject to a bi-weekly (once every two weeks) review call in which each project owner provides a brief summary of their project, including whether it is on or off track, blocked for any reason, at risk of exceeding its scope or budget, etc. See the [[events calendar]] for details.

=== Closure ===

==== Closing as delivered ====

Projects that meet their criteria for delivery will be closed with the &lt;code&gt;was:delivered&lt;/code&gt; label and a corresponding comment.

==== Closing as aborted ====

Projects may be aborted prior to delivery for a variety of reasons, including abandonment by project owner, consensus that the effort is no longer worth pursuing, exceeding allocated budget, being blocked by external factors, and so forth. Such projects will be closed with the &lt;code&gt;was:aborted&lt;/code&gt; label and a corresponding comment.

==== Closing as deferred ====

Projects that are blocked or stalled for an extended period of time may be closed with the &lt;code&gt;was:deferred&lt;/code&gt; label and a corresponding comment. Deferral is appropriate if the project is something that we&amp;#x27;d still like to do, but see no near-term path to actually working on. A deferred project may be reopened when it becomes feasible to work on it, but any prior budget allocation should be assumed invalid.

==== Closing as superseded ====

Projects may be closed with the &lt;code&gt;was:superseded&lt;/code&gt; label when another project becomes a more appropriate vehicle for getting the same or similar work done. When closing, a comment should be added providing a link to the superseding project.

=== Compensation ===

Ideally, compensation should be requested after a project has been closed, but this is not always practical. A contributor may request compensation for work on a given project prior to that project&amp;#x27;s closure assuming that the work in question has itself been meaningfully delivered. For example, if a [[Growth Team]] project involves creating and publishing an instructional video, the video creator may request compensation for their work assuming the video has been published and promoted to its intended audience even if the larger growth project is still in progress.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

First of all: Bitcoin is good for you and the rest of the world, and dealing with Bitcoin is, in itself, perfectly fine and natural. This means that when you privately trade on Bisq, you are most probably doing nothing wrong, on the contrary you are furthering the ideals Bitcoin was created for, even if someone might try to convince you otherwise.

There are parties though that would rather have Bitcoin either disappear, or be turned into the ultimate mass-control tool (the latter being a very realistic scenario, given the peculiarities of the blockchain and its workings). This might, in turn, lead these parties to act in such a way that Bitcoin itself doesn&amp;#x27;t prosper, or projects around it disappear completely.

This is not an advanced privacy/anonymity guide, but is rather tailored to Bisq contributors and their selective need for pseudonymity, which should not impact too much on convenience unless they cover very sensitive roles (in which case they are already prepared on the matter of personal security, and do not really need this guide anyway).

Bisq contributors, as key elements for Bisq&amp;#x27;s well being, might be among targeted individuals, and for this, other than for best practices regarding privacy on the internet, it is advisable they act accordingly, first and foremost for their own safety, and then for Bisq&amp;#x27;s.

The aim of this guide is containerization, which means that a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; will appear to an &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;adversary&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (someone trying to understand who you really are, to do bad things to you) as a specific individual, traceable online as &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, but hopefully (if you do things well enough) not linkable to their real identity, nor to other possible nyms &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; uses while participating in other projects.
In other words, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;adversary&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; will be able to tell if something on the internet has been said by &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, but it should not make them any wiser about who &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; really is, where they live, or which other works they have done for other initiatives.
We will be making Tor Browser work as a much more convenient, much less privacy hardened browser, that will still force you to connect through Tor to do whatever you need; in other words, we will use Tor Browser in a way that it is NOT intended to be used. An adversary will be able to fingerprint you as a nym, but they won&amp;#x27;t find details to locate your real identity if you are careful; the previous statement will not be liked by enthusiasts of online privacy, but a mild yet consistent plan, is still much better than a very strong plan that is not adhered to 100% of the time because it is very unconvenient.

Let&amp;#x27;s clear up some definitions:
* privacy is when someone knows who you are, but not what you do
* anonymity is when someone knows what you do, but not who you are
* pseudonymity is when someone knows &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; you are and what you do, but the &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; is an imaginary identity that exists only in its own reality, without any ties to your real or alternative identities

For more info:
* https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/pseudonymity-guide
* https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html

= Tenets =

* I will have a Bisq nym, that will be the only one used for everything related to Bisq
* My Bisq nym will be its own person, it will not be similar to, know about the existence of, or participate in the same chats/groups/forums/activities as my real or alternative identities
* I will only use Tor for everything the Bisq nym does
* I will endure the slowness of Tor, and will NOT use my real connection nor my faster VPN to do Bisq stuff

= Steps for base setup =
 
* download Tor Browser for your OS
* have Tor Browser &amp;quot;installed&amp;quot; (actually it is just uncompressed in a folder with no ties to registry or system config) in a path that&amp;#x27;s unique to your Bisq nym
* run Tor Browser (ignore the error about restarting Tor if there is another Tor Browser open, as they will try to bind the same ports, returning an error, and close the popup) and open &lt;code&gt;about:config&lt;/code&gt; in the URL bar, say that you really want to access the options, then search for &lt;code&gt;_port&lt;/code&gt;
* you want to edit &lt;code&gt;network.proxy.socks_port&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;extensions.torlauncher.control_port&lt;/code&gt;, the standard values here are respectively 9150 and 9151 (standalone tor daemon is 9050 and 9051), so you can change them to 9250 and 9251, or increase them to 9350 and 9351 if you want several Tor Browser instances running at the same time (this will run a dedicated Tor circuit builder for your Bisq activity)
* still in about:config, search for &amp;quot;privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing&amp;quot; and set it to false (allows maximizing pages to fill the whole screen)
* close Tor Browser and restart it (right after this, it&amp;#x27;s a good time to enable the automatic connection, which means Tor Browser will build a Tor circuit right after you start it) 
* go to geolocation.com in Tor Browser, verify the IP and location is different from your real ones (it will necessarily be, this is just to show you where you appear to be coming from, when using Tor) and from the one reported from any other Tor Browser you maybe already have on the system
* make sure the shield icon in top right is empty (clicking on it says &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot;); this will enable scripts, which are not &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; for anonymity, but you want a bit of convenience to be able to use Matrix and other websites that require javascript, as long as all activity in this browser stays within your Bisq nym
* go to settings &gt; privacy, and under &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; disable &amp;quot;always use private browsing&amp;quot;, this will restart Tor Browser; after restart, return to same settings, disable cookie deletion after Tor Browser closes (so you can log back in to websites automatically), enable all logins&amp;amp;passwords saving, and under history enable what suits you (enable both &amp;quot;remember&amp;quot; for maximum convenience), then under Permissions, block requests to access camera and location. Even if you don&amp;#x27;t disable mic access, the microphone will still be unavailable during web calls, because of a compile-time setting of Tor Browser.

== Tips ==

* sometimes Tor will become slow, really, unbearably torturing slow; stay strong, don&amp;#x27;t go clearnet; if all else fails, blame Tor with your correspondents, it will immediately excuse you for your unresponsiveness, and at the same time show you are very privacy-oriented and make you look really cool
* the usual tip to leave the tor browser window at default size is not really needed here, as we are okay with &amp;quot;fingerprinting&amp;quot; the nym
* sometimes the Tor connection will degrade to a point where it&amp;#x27;s not useable, and you need to create a new Tor circuit; do NOT, EVER click &amp;quot;New Identity&amp;quot; to do this, or you will lose every personalization (pinned tabs and history mainly), rather close Tor Browser and restart it

= Known issues and warnings =

* real anonymity does not exist, even if you could &amp;quot;plug&amp;quot; into the internet like rebels plugged into the Matrix, someone could still be able to trace the source of your &amp;quot;signal&amp;quot;; proper personal protection can be achieved based on one&amp;#x27;s dedication and skills, and always relative to one&amp;#x27;s threat model (a Bisq contributor shouldn&amp;#x27;t get the same attention that a whistleblower does, for example)
* it only takes one mistake, where you let a hint to your real identity slip through your pseudonym, and your whole nym is compromised, plus all of their past activity will be linked to you
* assume any online service will keep all the information about you that you allow it to obtain (browser/PC information via javascript, OS preferred language, obviously your IP, cookies...) and store them for the long term even after you think you deleted them
* assume that anything you do, say, or write, will be used against you, even if it was innocent and apparently inconsequential at the time
* in the above configuration, Tor Browser loses most of its specific privacy strengths, yet it&amp;#x27;s still very useful to have a portable, containerized browser that will only work through Tor, and builds its own Tor connection, distinct from any other Tor daemon you maybe have on your system (versus, for example, using several chromium instances tied to the same Tor proxy, which will all use the same entry and exit node, and which will be at risk of going on clearnet if for any reason the plugin you use to proxy through Tor doesn&amp;#x27;t do its job)
* this guide is only aimed at online protection, offering nothing in the compartment of offline security: anyone physically accessing your PC will be able to tell that you are, in fact, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, plus any other identity you might have used online, unless you also hardened your system with additional layers that will not be covered in this guide, at least for now (see Tails, Qubes, Whonix, or any other renowned tool for PC protection)

= Steps for accounts setup =
As a Bisq contributor, you will need at minimum a GitHub account, to be able to publish Compensation Requests. A GitHub account requires an email address, so you will need that one as well.
Protonmail is one email provider that will let you register -as of now- without any KYC elements (no other email addresses nor phone numbers needed); riseup.net also offers no-kyc email, but you need an invite by another user; in case you know of similar services, please notify us and we will gladly add them in this guide.
An account on matrix is also advised to access Bisq&amp;#x27;s space, you will register from https://bisq.chat and use the same email to associate to that account,  registering at https://bisq.community is needed to interact with the forum.
An interesting customization can be to obtain an AI generated face to associate with your account, there are many services that let you get such a picture for free.

= Burning Men considerations =

If a Bisq contributor wants to become act as one of the [[Burning Ben]] they will have additional privacy and opsec considerations.

* BSQ is inherently less private than bitcoin. BSQ can easily be traced back to a compensation request, DAO vote.
* Bitcoin accumulated from performing the role of a burning man also links it to a specific burning man address.  

Both of the above points should be considered by contributors concerned about privacy and opsec.</text></revision></page><page><title>Burning Men</title><ns>0</ns><id>621</id><revision><id>3786</id><timestamp>2024-10-29T17:52:56Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Burning Men&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is the name given to Bisq contributors who choose to burn BSQ in order to receive bitcoin from Bisq trading activity: [[Trading_fees|Trade fees]] and Delayed payout transactions. It&amp;#x27;s an evolution of the previous &amp;#x27;[[Donation Address Owner|burning man]]&amp;#x27; role. The change, implemented since January 2023 in this [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 proposal], aimed to increase Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralization by distributing this role within many contributors. A single burning man could have gone missing, ran away with the BTC before trading them for BSQ and burning these BSQ, or could have been otherwise compromised.&lt;br&gt;
As each burning men burns an undetermined amount of BSQ as a condition to receive a share of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, trust requirements and single points of failure are almost nonexistent.
Please note: The burningmen protocol described here is entirely different from burns made in Bisq 2 for increasing reputation. Burns made in Bisq 2 do not affect the burningmen protocol.

__TOC__

= Contributing as a Burningmen =

== Eligibility ==

There are two ways to contribute as a Burningmen. Since the system is not exempt of trust requirements, burningmen need to have provided value to Bisq in the past:

* Contributors who received compensation for their contributions within the last 24 cycles.
* Contributors who received a BSQ from the DAO genesis transaction.

After burning some BSQ (it does not matter if they were previously earned or bought in the BSQ market) they will get a share percentage in the distribution of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions. The more value they&amp;#x27;ve provided to Bisq, the bigger the portion of BSQ they are allowed to burn.

== Considerations before burning BSQ ==

Burningmen seek profit from burning BSQ, otherwise they would keep their BSQ or sell them for BTC at the market. But profit, coming from estimating the amount of BSQ to burn now to receive a share of future Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, is not granted. There are many sources of uncertainty:
* Trading volume: affected by BTC trend, Bisq competitors, mining fees, etc.
* Changes to trade protocol: traders could burn more or less BSQ directly, Delayed payout transactions could be reduced considerably.
* BSQ/BTC price volatility.
* BSQ burnt by competing Burningmen. 

Since the launch of the Burningmen protocol up to the moment of this writing (Cycle 61), more bitcoin has been distributed to the Burningmen than the bitcoin equivalent amount of BSQ that has been burnt. This means that, historically, burning BSQ has been profitable for most contributors. &lt;br&gt;
Although Bisq provides an estimation of BSQ to burn based in the past, each of the Burningmen should estimate their risk/reward scenarios based in their predictions. Becoming a Burningmen is optional. Depending on how they value the BSQ they have now, the BTC they can obtain on the future, or even if they just want to help Bisq grow, they will not burn BSQ at all, burn all the BSQ from their compensation requests or even buy more BSQ to burn up to their limit.  &lt;br&gt;
The less competition between Burningmen there is, the more profitable it will be for each of them, and vice versa. The less profitable Burningmen role is, the better for the DAO, as more BSQ is burnt, reducing or containing BSQ supply and therefore pressuring its price up.

= Burning BSQ and receiving BTC =

== Contributors ==

When doing their compensation request, a contributor should fill the &amp;quot;Burningman receiving address&amp;quot; with a BTC address to receive the funds to. Once the compensation request is approved, that address will be used for any burning men payouts they receive up until they ever change it in a subsequent approved compensation request. If that field is never completed, an address from Bisq wallet will be used as receiving address. &lt;br&gt;
It is highly recommended to use an external wallet like electrum or sparrow, which are able to handle many UTXOs and can connect to a signing device for cold storage.

To burn BSQ for the BSQ burning man role the current contributor will see their assigned name &amp;#x27;contributor_name&amp;#x27; in the [[Burning_Men#Burning_Men_Protocol_UI|Burningmen Protocol UI]]. They can then choose to burn an amount of BSQ and press burn. &lt;br&gt;
Since &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Issuance share&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is capped depending on how many BTC were earned in the last 2 years (decaying linearly) it&amp;#x27;s important to make sure that the amount of BTC to burn will not exceed the cap. It would be prudent to begin with small amounts and never exceed the lower amount in the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;burn target&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; column.

== Receivers of the genesis distribution ==

If a contributor has funds from the genesis output(s) in their Bisq wallet they will see their assigned name &amp;#x27;Bisq co founder XX&amp;#x27; in the [[Burning_Men#Burning_Men_Protocol_UI|Burningmen Protocol UI]]. They should chose the BTC address to receive funds and follow the instructions in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390#issuecomment-1306075295 github proposal].

Burning BSQ works as described in the second paragraph at [[Burning_Men#Contributors|contributors]] section.

= Burning Men Protocol UI =

The user interface to interact with the Burning Men User protocol user interface can be found at &lt;code&gt;DAO &gt; Proof of Burn &gt; Burning Men&lt;/code&gt;.

== Burning Men Candidates fields ==

* Contributor name: Always use the same name as per github handle when doing compensation requests to avoid duplicated similar contributors with different names and shares.
* Burn target: Click the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; icon to get more info. Take these numbers as broad estimates and do not use the  one on the right as your cap will be exceeded. Even using the left value could make you reach your cap. Do not make decisions based on what to burn on these numbers alone.
* Receiver share: It informs about the % chance of receiving a trade fee and % amount of the delayed payout transactions you&amp;#x27;ll receive. It&amp;#x27;s updated every block and changes based on who burns BSQ &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the decay over time of the burns made by the burningmen. Each BSQ burnt amount decays linearly to zero over 12 months. To protect the DAO from an attack from a malicious contributor who self trades sending their trades to arbitration, the maximum share each contributor can get is 11%, no matter how many BSQ they burn.
* Issuance share: It&amp;#x27;s the amount of BSQ compensation each contributor has received over the last 24 cycles, decaying linearly. Recent contributions have a higher weight. It bears maximum receiver share. A burning man can get a receiver share of up to 10 times their issuance share amount, up to a maximum of 11%. A 0.7% percent issuance share will limit the receiver share to 7%.
* Burned amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by contributor over time
* Decayed burn amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by the contributor when taking into account the decay their burns have over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the &amp;#x27;receiver share&amp;#x27; value and changes every block.
* Issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor over time.
* Decayed issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor when taking into account the decay over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the &amp;#x27;issuance share&amp;#x27; value.

== Profit fields==

When selecting a burningmen, individual profit stats are displayed. It can be filtered by burning, trading fee and/or DPT eventsand by month or individual events. Looking at monthly profits can be used as an indicator of how many BSQ to burn. Note that it&amp;#x27;s normal to have a negative profit at the beginning, since receiver shares decay linearly over 12 cycles. A burning man should not expect to regain in one month what will be distributed during a longer period. &lt;br&gt;
Scrolling down at the _Profit_ table, it&amp;#x27;s possible to export all burningman data from a contributor by clicking &lt;code&gt;export to CSV&lt;/code&gt;.

== DAO fields ==
It gives an overview of BSQ burning and bitcoin distribution across all DAO contributors.

* Total amount of burned BSQ: All time amount of BSQ that has been burnt by all contributors acting as burning men.
* Total amount of distributed BTC/BSQ: All time amount of bitcoin that has been distributed to all contributors acting as burning men. For ease of comparison this figure is also given as a BSQ amount.
* Export to CSV: To see the results by month rather than all time in a CSV file, getting a more granular data.

If the amount of BSQ being distributed is greater than the amount being burnt then the burning men are generally in profit from their activities. If the amount of BSQ being distributed is less than the amount being burnt then the burning men are in a loss from their activities.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Reputation-section-new.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>625</id><revision><id>3742</id><timestamp>2024-10-03T16:28:29Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

To help new Bisq users who don&amp;#x27;t already have enough bitcoin to use Bisq, there is an &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;informal market for small BTC trades&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. 

Trades take place on the [[Matrix bisq.chat]] space, in the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room. You need to join [https://www.bisq.chat bisq.chat] first to be allowed to join the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Get your first BTC&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; room.  

As of 2024, the get your first BTC room has now been largely replaced by [[Bisq Easy]].

This article covers benefits, risks, and rules to be aware of when using this informal BTC marketplace.

{{Admonition_Warn|This marketplace takes the form of a Matrix chat room, so trades are NOT secured by any of the security mechanisms of Bisq software (e.g. multi-signature escrows, mediation, arbitration, DAO, etc).

Therefore be aware that such trading is inherently risky. See [[#Risks|risks]] below.}}

__TOC__

== Background ==

For new users, Bisq requires between 0.002 and 0.007 BTC for traders to make their first trade:
* 0.001 - 0.006 BTC security deposit
* 0.001 BTC miner fee and trade fee

It can be difficult for new bitcoiners to acquire their first coins, so this requirement is often a barrier for new Bisq users. The [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room offers one possible way to get this initial bitcoin without signing up for a centralized exchange. 

Other solutions are listed at [[Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin|Funding your wallet]].

== Risks ==

Make sure you understand these risks before trading:

* Not entirely anonymous - Unless you access through Tor, IP address and other usage metrics may reveal your identity
* Must trust traders - Trades are not secured by deposits as they are on Bisq
* No dispute resolution - Trades depend solely on user reputation, so there&amp;#x27;s no recourse if something goes wrong

== Trading rules ==

To maximize the chances that trades go smoothly, the following rules apply:

* Maximum trade size is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;0.007&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BTC. BTC buyers can buy a maximum of 0.007 BTC in one transaction. BTC sellers can sell a maximum of 0.007 BTC in one transaction.
* Traders can negotiate their prices. Sellers of BTC will likely charge a high premium to cover mining fees, time, and profit.
* BTC buyers should post on the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room the amount they are looking to buy, the payment method they are looking to use, and which currency they wish to make payment in: for example, &amp;quot;I am looking to buy 0.007 BTC with GBP using Revolut. Is anyone online willing to take this offer?&amp;quot;
* Trades between interested parties can be negotiated and settled in direct messages.
* Only [[Payment methods|payment methods]] used in Bisq are allowed. Preference should be given to those with immediate payment: e.g. Revolut, TransferWise, SEPA Instant, Zelle, Faster Payments etc.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;There are no refunds, no mediation, no arbitration, and no dispute resolution of any kind available.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Beware!
* DAO compensation requests or reimbursement requests related to such trades are not allowed.
* Any trader can be kicked out of the room at the discretion of the room owner. The [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room is moderated to preclude foul play and bad actors.

== Considerations ==

As you are potentially linking your Matrix username to your payment account you might want to consider using a Matrix throwaway account for increased privacy.

Additionally, if you&amp;#x27;re not confident in the reputation of a trader, it may be a good idea to split a trade into multiple installments. This will reduce your losses if a trader disappears after payment, but should be weighed against transaction fees. If you are trading fiat, also consider the risk of a bank finding multiple transactions more suspicious than a single large purchase.

If a trader isn&amp;#x27;t comfortable with multiple installments, it&amp;#x27;s most likely out of their control, and you may want to find another trader or an alternative payment method. As always, you are doing this at your own risk; make sure to consider someone&amp;#x27;s track record to determine how cautious you should be. A trader that has consistently delivered positive results is more trustworthy than someone who hasn&amp;#x27;t completed any trades yet.

If a trader has treated you well, leaving a positive review in chat will help others with their own evaluation of that trader; likewise, if you have a bad experience with a trader, don&amp;#x27;t be afraid to leave a negative review, even if there is a possibility that it could&amp;#x27;ve been accidental.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Matrix web main screen.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>518</id><revision><id>2735</id><timestamp>2022-01-20T20:43:52Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Both Bisq traders must follow these &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;trading rules&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to ensure smooth and successful trades.

To trade on Bisq, you assume one of two roles, no matter what national currency or cryptocurrency you’re trading: you either &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buy bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;sell bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

The rules below are &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;default&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; rules for every transaction. Offer makers sometimes specify their own additional terms for handling payments. For example, a seller using cash deposits might require a picture of a receipt torn in half with &amp;quot;NO REFUND&amp;quot; written on it. Face-to-face traders often specify terms about where and how to meet. 

Make sure you’re okay with an offer-maker’s terms &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;before&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; you accept an offer!

Trade rules also help with the following:

* Promoting good behavior from traders
* Penalizing bad behavior from traders
* Promoting good payment accounts of traders
* Penalizing bad payment accounts of traders
* Put the &amp;#x27;wrong doer&amp;#x27; in a worse position and the person &amp;#x27;not at fault&amp;#x27; in a better position

= Common rules =

=== No requirement to reply in trader chat ===

While using the available trade chat can be helpful to resolve issues directly among traders without the overhead of mediation, and being communicative is a good way to ease the process for new traders, there is no obligation to reply to a peer&amp;#x27;s messages.

=== Do not communicate with your peer away from Bisq ===

Using email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is strongly discouraged. The trader chat feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader’s chat messages indicate they broke a rule). This includes advertising offers to sell BTC with a way to contact you, for example a website, Telegram user name, or email.

In any case, it is forbidden to contact the peer using contacts obtained from their payment details, without their prior consent, or missing a compelling reason to do so.

=== Be responsive during a dispute ===

Traders are expected to reply within 48hrs to either mediators or arbitrators, and could lose the dispute based on unresponsiveness.

Mediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.

=== Do not change payment details once trade is in progress ===

Once the deposit transaction is published, the trade is in progress, and its terms cannot be changed. Traders agreed to use the payment details specified in the trade contract.

In the event of an unexpected circumstance (e.g. hitting a bank-imposed transfer limit, or a payment institution interfering with the transaction), traders can propose alternatives through trader chat or mediation, but the peer is not required to comply. It is each trader&amp;#x27;s responsibility to ensure that the payment account in their offer will work before an offer is taken.

= Rules for bitcoin sellers =

Whether making or taking an offer, bitcoin sellers put all the bitcoin they’re selling in the multisig escrow, so there’s less for them to do and fewer rules they need to follow.

=== Click &lt;code&gt;Confirm payment&lt;/code&gt; after receiving payment ===

Sellers have until the end of the maximum trade period to do so.

[[Account_limits#Account_signing|Account signing]], introduced in Bisq v1.2, enables a seller with a signed payment account to sign a buyer’s payment account when they successfully receive a payment. For such trades, it is recommended that the seller take as long as possible (i.e., wait until close to the end of the trade period) to confirm receipt of payment to reduce the chance of a chargeback.

=== Do not confirm payments with mismatching details ===

Payer name, account numbers, payment method, institution, and other details of a payment should match the details in the trade contract. If there are any concerns that buyer&amp;#x27;s payment details do not match (e.g. wrong name, account number etc) payment should not be accepted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

{{Admonition_Warn|This is especially relevant for trades in which a signed seller trades with an unsigned buyer, because confirmation of payment receipt signs the buyer’s payment account. In case of such an issue, a dispute should be opened.}}

= Rules for bitcoin buyers =

{{Admonition_Warn|To avoid unexpected issues, make sure you can actually carry out a payment with the payment method you’ve set up in Bisq. Examples: Wells Fargo doesn’t allow cash deposits into bank accounts not owned by the depositor, and Zelle has weekly and monthly transfer maximums that are easy to overlook. The software will warn you about known issues, but cannot possibly keep up with all the newest banking and money transfer rules.}}

=== Make payment reasonably early within trade period ===

Buyer should complete at a time such that the seller has enough time to acknowledge receipt of the payment before the trade period is over. Waiting until the very end of the trade period to make a payment is not advised, as then the seller cannot reasonably act in time to acknowledge receipt (also, it’s annoying). The lengths of trade periods vary based on [[Payment methods|payment method]].

This is especially important for buyers with unsigned payment accounts trading with sellers with signed payment accounts. A seller will not want to confirm receipt of a payment made at the last minute from an untrusted account, so if you’re a buyer looking to get your payment account signed, you should make the payment &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;as soon as possible&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Some payment methods include an option to cancel a payment after you have sent it eg Revolut and Interac e-Transfer. If you cancel payment without agreement with the seller or mediator you might end up being penalized for cancelling the trade.

=== Click Payment started after sending payment ===

Seller cannot mark payment as received until buyer confirms that they have sent it. 

Don’t forget to do this!

=== Leave the &amp;quot;reason for payment&amp;quot; field empty ===

{{Admonition_Warn|Before 1.5.5, it was required to put the trade ID in the &amp;#x27;reason for payment&amp;#x27; field of a payment. As of 1.5.5, reason for payment should be left BLANK.}}

Some payments offer a way to specify a reason for payment (some payment methods call it &amp;quot;Message&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Information for recipient&amp;quot; or similar). &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Leave this field BLANK.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Do not put the trade ID, any mentions of &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Bitcoin&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;crypto&amp;quot;, or any other text whatsoever.

If you are required to fill in a reason, use your account name eg &amp;quot;Joe Bloggs&amp;quot; alternatively enter something non-descriptive like a dash &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;. If you would prefer to use other text please agree this with your peer in trader chat. Please remember your peer is not obligated to agree anything and may not want to agree to anything other than leaving the description blank, your name or a dash. 

Violating this rule will likely result in a [[Table of penalties|trade penalty]]. 

Many banks don’t like anything related to Bitcoin, and may take draconian measures if they sense such a transaction.

Many users trade from personal accounts and may object to using anything that looks like it could be a commercial transaction.

=== Pay any transaction fees ===

Any fees incurred to make the payment via the agreed payment method (e.g., bank fees for bank transfer, money-order fees for money orders, etc) are the buyer’s responsibility to pay.

The seller should receive the exact amount of the trade. The only exception to this rule is if the receiving institution imposes a fee on incoming payments—these fees are borne by the seller.

= What happens when things go wrong? =

Sometimes trades do not go to plan for whatever reason. 

It is prudent for all traders to know when entering into the trade what will happen when things go wrong. Traders would be wise to make themselves aware of the [[dispute resolution]] process to ensure there are no surprises.</text></revision></page><page><title>Funding your wallet</title><ns>0</ns><id>71</id><revision><id>3816</id><timestamp>2024-12-23T03:35:50Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Before trading on Bisq, it&amp;#x27;s necessary to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;fund your wallet&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; with bitcoin. This is because making and taking offers on Bisq requires traders to post a security deposit and pay fees with bitcoin. 

Posting bitcoin [[security deposit|security deposits]] in a 2of2 multisignature address is part of what makes trading on Bisq highly secure.

== Security Deposit Requirements == 

You can see the required deposits for an offer by clicking on the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; icon for an offer. You&amp;#x27;ll see a pop-up appear. On the bottom of this pop-up will be a &lt;code&gt;Details&lt;/code&gt; section with a &lt;code&gt;Security Deposit&lt;/code&gt; line.

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

[[File:See-offer-details.png|frameless|left|600px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

=== For Buyers ===

Buyers need to post a deposit of at least 15% of the trade amount, with an absolute minimum of 0.001 BTC. The maximum possible deposit for a buyer is 50% of the trade amount. The offer maker sets this percentage when creating an offer. 

=== For Sellers ===

Sellers need to post a deposit of 15% of the trade amount with an absolute minimum of 0.001 BTC (in addition to 100% of the bitcoin being sold). As of this writing, the security deposit percentage for sellers cannot be adjusted.

=== Notes for Buyers and Sellers ===

If the size of an offer is a range, the required security deposit is calculated according to the maximum possible trade size. Example: if the buyer&amp;#x27;s deposit is set to 20% for an offer with a 0.05-0.10 BTC trade size, the buyer will need to post a 0.02 BTC security deposit. The seller would need to post a deposit of 0.015 BTC (for a total deposit of 0.115 BTC, since they&amp;#x27;d also have to post the entire &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;possible&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; trade amount).

== How to Obtain Your First Bitcoin == 

If you don’t already own any bitcoin, you’ll need to obtain some—ideally, as privately and securely as possible. 

How much do you need? In addition to covering a security deposit (as described above), traders also need to cover mining fees and [[Trading_fees|trading fees]]. Estimates for both are shown in the interface when making or taking an offer. As of this writing, a safe estimate for buying your first bitcoin on Bisq with fiat is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;0.002 BTC&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Here are some ideas for how to do that.

[[File:Get-first-bitcoin.png|thumb|right|A graphical overview of how to get your first bitcoin privately.]]

* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;[[Bisq Easy]]&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.  Bisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2 that allows users to buy bitcoin with no trade fees and no security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol. It is meant for bitcoin buyers with limited experience using peer to peer software to purchase no KYC bitcoin and to be smoothly on-boarded by experienced and helpful bitcoin sellers.
* [[Getting_your_first_BTC|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Matrix room&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;]]. Bisq&amp;#x27;s Matrix chat offers a &lt;code&gt;Get your first BTC&lt;/code&gt; room for trusted and bonded Bisq users to sell first-time Bisq users their first BTC so they can use Bisq. 
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Friends and family&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Simply buy a small amount of bitcoin directly from someone you trust. 
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bitcoin ATM&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Some bitcoin ATMs don&amp;#x27;t require ID for smaller purchases, and some don&amp;#x27;t require any ID at all. You can find bitcoin ATMs in your area on [https://coinatmradar.com/ Coin ATM Radar].
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Sell something&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Do you offer a product or service? Use BTCPayServer to collect BTC for it! Otherwise don&amp;#x27;t forget about local marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace—many people are willing to buy and sell everyday goods for BTC.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Work for it&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. While sites to find gigs that pay in bitcoin never really panned out, it may not hurt to let a client or business contact know that you also accept bitcoin for payment.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Meetups&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. People at bitcoin meetups might have bitcoin. Crazy, right? Find out where and when they take place on Meetup, Twitter, and other places where people talk about bitcoin.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Vouchers&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Companies like [https://fastbitcoins.com/ Fastbitcoins.com] and [https://azte.co/ Azte.co] may sell vouchers at physical stores in your area for cash. There aren&amp;#x27;t a whole lot of locations yet, but more are being added all the time.

It&amp;#x27;s highly recommended that you avoid using a corporate, centralized exchange to get your first bitcoin. Most such exchanges (like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc) require a significant amount of personal information, putting you at risk by tying your identity to your bitcoin (as well as by storing all this information in databases with that of others, forming what are commonly referred to as &amp;quot;honeypots&amp;quot;—highly attractive targets for hackers). Also, since bitcoin transactions are public and easily traceable, any future transactions involving bitcoin purchased with these services can be traced back to you.

Bisq is built from the ground up to avoid this privacy fiasco, so we strongly recommend avoiding centralized exchanges.

== Sending Bitcoin to your Bisq wallet ==

Once you’ve gotten enough bitcoin for your security deposit and fees, you can move it into Bisq’s built-in wallet. This isn’t strictly required, but it’ll make trading more convenient since the funds you need to accept an offer will be readily available when you need them.

To send bitcoin to your Bisq wallet, you&amp;#x27;ll need an address. You&amp;#x27;ll find one on &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Receive Funds&lt;/code&gt;. 

You might see many addresses listed. Pick the address on the bottom next to the QR code.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

To help new Bisq users who don&amp;#x27;t already have enough bitcoin to use Bisq, there is an &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;informal market for small BTC trades&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. 

Trades take place on the [[Matrix bisq.chat]] space, in the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room. You need to join [https://www.bisq.chat bisq.chat] first to be allowed to join the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Get your first BTC&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; room.  

As of 2024, the get your first BTC room has now been largely replaced by [[Bisq Easy]].

This article covers benefits, risks, and rules to be aware of when using this informal BTC marketplace.

{{Admonition_Warn|This marketplace takes the form of a Matrix chat room, so trades are NOT secured by any of the security mechanisms of Bisq software (e.g. multi-signature escrows, mediation, arbitration, DAO, etc).

Therefore be aware that such trading is inherently risky. See [[#Risks|risks]] below.}}

__TOC__

== Background ==

For new users, Bisq requires between 0.002 and 0.007 BTC for traders to make their first trade:
* 0.001 - 0.006 BTC security deposit
* 0.001 BTC miner fee and trade fee

It can be difficult for new bitcoiners to acquire their first coins, so this requirement is often a barrier for new Bisq users. The [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room offers one possible way to get this initial bitcoin without signing up for a centralized exchange.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

The Bisq network is organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s purpose is to make the Bisq&amp;#x27;s governance model as decentralized and censorship-resistant as the Bisq network itself.

The Bisq founders realized that decentralized software—no matter how technically robust—is no good if it’s still controlled by a single entity. All the software’s technical strength would be worthless if the whole project could be ruined by attacking the single entity that runs it.

Thus the need for decentralizing the resources in charge of running Bisq itself. These resources cannot be organized in the form of a company, a nonprofit, or any other traditional organization because a single entity would be a single point of failure. But what to do? How can a project do anything useful without becoming an organization with some kind of structure? How can strategy be determined? How can resources be allocated? How can work get done? How can revenue be earned, and how can it be distributed?

The Bisq project needed infrastructure to provide these functions, and the Bisq DAO is its solution.

{{Admonition_Note|You do not have to participate in any aspect of the DAO or BSQ to use Bisq, but you may find it interesting. It&amp;#x27;s built entirely on Bitcoin and been operating since early 2019 without major issue.

The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is where all of Bisq&amp;#x27;s data files are stored.

It is crucial that you [[Backing_up_application_data|back up this directory]] regularly.

__TOC__

= Data directory structure =

Notable items in the data directory:

* &lt;code&gt;bisq.log&lt;/code&gt; - main log file with most recent logs, often helpful for debugging. This file may contain private information, so it&amp;#x27;s usually not wise to post the whole thing publicly.
* &lt;code&gt;bisq.properties&lt;/code&gt; - place to store [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/common/src/main/java/bisq/common/config/Config.java#L57 command-line options], so you don&amp;#x27;t have to specify them every time you run Bisq (where each option is on a new line in &lt;code&gt;&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&lt;/code&gt; format, e.g., &lt;code&gt;dumpStatistics=true&lt;/code&gt;).
* &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/&lt;/code&gt; - main data directory.
** &lt;code&gt;keys/&lt;/code&gt; - keys for signing P2P messages as well as signing and aging payment accounts.
** &lt;code&gt;db/&lt;/code&gt; - various user data and network data. It is strongly discouraged to edit any files in this directory.
** &lt;code&gt;tor/&lt;/code&gt; - Tor state data. The &lt;code&gt;hiddenservice/&lt;/code&gt; folder within determines your onion address.
** &lt;code&gt;wallet/&lt;/code&gt; - BTC and BSQ wallet files and rolling backups, as well as the &lt;code&gt;bisq.spvchain&lt;/code&gt; file.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

To use Bisq, you must first &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;[https://bisq.network/downloads/ download and install]&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; it. Most exchanges are centralized exchanges running on servers controlled by the exchange. Bisq is decentralized, running only on the desktops of Bisq users.

Bisq manages offers to trade using a peer-to-peer network. This is a global network made of users who are also running Bisq on their own computers.

Centralized services are easy to monitor, block, and shut down, while peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, Bitcoin and Bisq are difficult to surveil, censor, shut down or hack.

All of this means that if you want to use the Bisq network, you must download and run the software on your own machine.

== Download Bisq ==

The most convenient way to install Bisq on your machine is from a pre-built install file from the [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Bisq website] or [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest latest GitHub release].

There&amp;#x27;s also a community-maintained [https://snapcraft.io/bisq-desktop Snap package] for various Linux distributions.

{{Admonition_Note|See [[#OS-specific_install_notes|install notes for various Linux distributions below]].}}

You can download the installer for your operating system and install Bisq right away, but we strongly recommend that you [[ #Verify installer file | verify the integrity ]] of your installer file first.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;If you have issues, please check the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Known issues with installation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; section in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest release notes].&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

== Verify installer file ==

=== Bisq2 specific instructions ===

Bisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.

Usually, installation binaries are signed by Alejandro García (key ID: E222AA02, primary release manager). However, since this key has expired — and the expired key was included in previous versions of the Bisq2 app — the in-app verification process would fail when attempting to download version 2.1.2. To prevent this issue, the secondary release manager assumed responsibility for signing that release. The signingkey.asc file specifies the key used for signing the binaries.

HenrikJannsen&amp;#x27;s signing key can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc here] (full fingerprint: B8A5 D214 ADFA A387 A14C  8BCF 02AA 2BAE 387C 8307).

To import the key in Linux and MacOS:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc | gpg --import &lt;/nowiki&gt;

GPG will return &amp;quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&amp;quot;, this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)

To verify the installer against the signature:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Replace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.

In Windows. you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].

Any software that manages funds, signs transactions, and deals with highly sensitive data is a prime target for malware. Bisq does all three. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you verify the integrity of the installer file you use to install Bisq.

This verification is something that you should do for the initial Bisq install. After the initial install, you will be prompted to install updates through Bisq&amp;#x27;s interface. The Bisq software will verify the integrity of updates for you.

Bisq installer files are currently built and signed by Alejandro Garcia (alejandrogarcia83). His public key ID is &lt;code&gt;E222AA02&lt;/code&gt; and fingerprint is &lt;code&gt;B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02&lt;/code&gt;, which you can verify through [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/commits?author=alejandrogarcia83 commits on GitHub].

The full public key is available [https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc here on the Bisq website].

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;bisq-1-obtain-signature-files-for-installer-files&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
= Bisq 1: Obtain signature files for installer files =

All Bisq releases are cryptographically signed by its maintainer. Users can ensure that nobody tampered with the release by verifying its signatures. It’s recommended to download the GPG key from an independent keyserver (such as [https://keys.openpgp.org/ keys.openpgp.org] or [https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ keyserver.ubuntu.com] to ensure that no adversary replaced the GPG keys and signatures on the release server.

Bisq 1 releases are signed either by Alejandro García (alejandrogarcia83) or Gabriel Bernard (gabernard). Here are the public key ids and fingerprints of both keys:

Alejandro García (public key id &lt;code&gt;0xF806F422E222AA02&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;code&gt;B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02&lt;/code&gt; Gabriel Bernard (public key id &lt;code&gt;0x6C8D14D84A133008&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;code&gt;1655 3BA9 2694 95EE 53BB  A33A 6C8D 14D8 4A13 3008&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;windows&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Windows ==

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;download-and-install-gpg4win&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Download and install Gpg4win ===

Windows does not come with GPG software installed by default, so you will need to install it in order to verify Bisq’s installer files. You can get Gpg4win [https://www.gpg4win.org/ here]. Double-click the installer file and proceed to install with all default settings.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;import-alejandro-garcías-key&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Import Alejandro García’s key ===

Open Kleopatra (part of Gpg4win) and click on “Lookup on Server”. 

[[File:Image_1.cleaned.png]]

Next type into the search field &lt;code&gt;alejandro.garcia@disroot.org&lt;/code&gt; and press on search. You’ll see the following output:

[[File:Image 2.cleaned.png]]

Press on “Details…” to see the key’s fingerprint and confirm that it is correct.

[[File:Image 3.cleaned.png]]

After verifying that the fingerprint is correct, press on “Close” and press on “Import” to import the key.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;verify-the-signature-of-the-binary-you-downloaded&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Verify the signature of the binary you downloaded ===

With the &lt;code&gt;install-file.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;signature-file.exe.asc&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory, double-click on the &lt;code&gt;.exe.asc&lt;/code&gt; file.

You should see a Kleopatra window pop up with a green progress bar that says “Verified .exe with .exe.asc”. The program will continue to say “The data could not be verified” in bold but you can disregard that message.

This means the installer file we downloaded is intact and as intended. You can proceed to install Bisq by double-clicking the .exe file.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;mac-and-linux&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Mac and Linux ==

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;import-alejandro-garcías-key-1&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Import Alejandro García’s key ===

To import Alejandro García’s open a terminal and run:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --receive-keys 0xF806F422E222AA02&lt;/pre&gt;
Next you need to verify key’s fingerprint and tell GPG to trust the key. First run:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --edit-key 0xF806F422E222AA02&lt;/pre&gt;
Then type:

&lt;pre&gt;fpr&lt;/pre&gt;
Now ensure that you see the same output as here:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg&amp;amp;gt; fpr
pub   rsa4096/0xF806F422E222AA02 2022-09-28 Alejandro García &amp;amp;lt;alejandro.garcia@disroot.org&amp;amp;gt;
 Primary key fingerprint: B493 3191 06CC 3D1F 252E  19CB F806 F422 E222 AA02&lt;/pre&gt;
If the fingerprint matches you can trust the key. To trust the key type:

&lt;pre&gt;trust&lt;/pre&gt;
Now you’ll see following output:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg&amp;amp;gt; trust
pub  rsa4096/0xF806F422E222AA02
     created: 2022-09-28  expires: 2026-10-03  usage: SC  
     trust: unknown       validity: unknown
sub  rsa4096/0xE7F08D07C72561D0
     created: 2022-09-28  expires: 2026-10-03  usage: E   
[ unknown] (1). Alejandro García &amp;amp;lt;alejandro.garcia@disroot.org&amp;amp;gt;

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users&amp;#x27; keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don&amp;#x27;t know or won&amp;#x27;t say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision?&lt;/pre&gt;
Type &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; to trust to the key and you’ll see following output:

&lt;pre&gt;Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) &lt;/pre&gt;
Now type &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to confirm. Now you can quit by typing &lt;code&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;span id=&amp;quot;verify-the-signature-of-the-binary-you-downloaded-1&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Verify the signature of the binary you downloaded ===

With the installer file and installer signature file in the same directory, run:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg --verify INSTALLER.asc INSTALLER&lt;/pre&gt;
Where &lt;code&gt;INSTALLER.asc&lt;/code&gt; is the filename of the &lt;code&gt;.asc&lt;/code&gt; file you just downloaded.

You should see an output similar to this:

&lt;pre&gt;gpg: Signature made Fri 22 Nov 2024 07:42:50 PM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key B493319106CC3D1F252E19CBF806F422E222AA02

== Build from source ==

[https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/build.md Building Bisq from source] requires only a single command once you have the correct JDK installed on your machine. 

Finding and installing the correct JDK can sometimes be frustrating, so Bisq&amp;#x27;s developers have written scripts to make it easier:
* [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/scripts/install_java.sh For Linux and macOS]
* [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/scripts/install_java.bat For Windows]

== OS-specific install notes ==

=== macOS ===

Starting with version v1.9.6, we remove notarization from our build pipeline because of of the risk of Apple certification revocation (see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions/6341). Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS.

You will receive an error popup saying that Bisq &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;is damaged and can&amp;#x27;t be opened. You should move it to the Trash&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Please follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

If you are running already macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to do following to be able to start Bisq:
* enter following command in Apple Terminal &lt;code&gt;sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq.app&lt;/code&gt;
* hit enter and you will be prompted to enter your password to be able to execute the command as super user

After running this successfully you should be able to start Bisq as always.

If this procedure still does not allow you to install Bisq, a last resort workaround is to install Bisq in a Linux Virtual Machine running on your system.

=== Windows ===

Starting with version v1.9.6, we remove the developer code signing because of the same reason as with Apple.

For Windows you just have to ignore the warning after you have verified the installation file yourself and proceed with the installation.

=== Linux (General) ===

Bisq works with a number of Linux distros, but not all desktop environments are supported. 

These are all known compatible desktop environments. This is a growing list. If you find another compatible desktop, please inform us so it can be added.

* GNOME
* Mate
* Xfce
* KDE Plasma
* Cinnamon

Bisq might not work properly if you switch from the original desktop environment of your Linux distribution to a different one.

Note: users with discrete GPUs may encounter issues launching Bisq in some desktop environments.

=== Arch Linux ===

The Bisq [https://bisq.network/downloads/ downloads page] includes a link to the Arch User Repository (AUR) page for the [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bisq/ bisq package].

# From the command line, clone the repository from AUR. 
# Then from the cloned directory, run &lt;code&gt;makepkg -si&lt;/code&gt;. This will read the PKGBUILD file to download, verify, build, and install the various tools necessary to install Bisq.

If the version found on AUR is not up to date, you can read [[Fix_Arch_release]].

Please be advised: when you&amp;#x27;re using AUR, you&amp;#x27;re responsible for your own safety. Be sure to verify the PKGBUILD file.

=== Gentoo ===

Use &lt;code&gt;eselect repository enable booboo&lt;/code&gt; to use the &amp;#x27;booboo&amp;#x27; overlay which carries the binaries, and then emerge &lt;code&gt;bisq&lt;/code&gt;

=== Tails ===

Please see [[Running Bisq on Tails]] for details on downloading, installing, and configuring Bisq on Tails.

=== Qubes ===

Please see [[Running Bisq on Qubes]] for a detailed Qubes setup guide.

== Update Bisq ==

Installing a new Bisq version will update Bisq. More details at [[Updating Bisq]].

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Participating in a DAO voting cycle&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is something any stakeholder can do—Bisq trader, contributor, or anyone else who wants to help the project succeed.

This article covers how to make a proposal and vote on other proposals, as well as how the BSQ token enables this process to be handled in a decentralized and trustless but meritocratic way.

For a brief overview of how the Bisq DAO works at a high level, see the [[Introduction to the DAO|DAO introduction article]].

__TOC__

== Background ==

As covered in the [[Introduction to the DAO]] article, the Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s governance model helps achieve several functions for the Bisq project.

This governance model is composed of voting cycles: periods of 4,679 blocks (approximately 1 month) made of 4 phases:
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Proposal phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which stakeholders submit compensation requests and other proposals requesting reimbursements for trading fees, changes in trading parameters, or changes in some other aspect of the Bisq project. After the proposal phase is over, there is a break of 150 blocks (about 1 day) to review and discuss proposals before voting begins.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Blind voting phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which stakeholders cast their votes on submitted proposals. Votes are encrypted in this phase to prevent later voters from being influenced by earlier voters. Following the end of the blind voting phase, there is a break of 10 blocks to protect against reorgs.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Vote reveal phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which each stakeholder sends the decryption key for their vote. Again, for protection against reorgs, there is a break of 10 blocks after this phase is over.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Vote result phase&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, in which vote results are calculated and BSQ is issued accordingly.

You can see approximate start and end dates for the current voting cycle at &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Dashboard&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Show-dao-blocks.png|700px|thumb|left|DAO blocks and estimated calendar times.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Acquire BSQ ==

In order to participate in DAO voting, you will need BSQ. See how to acquire BSQ [[Paying_trading_fees_with_BSQ#Acquire_BSQ|in this article]].

As of this writing, making a proposal costs 2 BSQ and casting a ballot (voting) costs 2 BSQ. You&amp;#x27;ll also need some plain BTC for transaction fees (each DAO action is a bitcoin transaction which requires mining fees to be paid), and if you will be [[Making_a_compensation_request|asking for compensation]] or reimbursement, you&amp;#x27;ll need to include some plain BTC to be colored into BTC (precise amount is 100 satoshis × [requested BSQ amount]).

Keep this in mind when buying BSQ to get started for the first time, and make sure you have a BTC balance in your Bisq wallet that&amp;#x27;s sufficient for what you want to do.

== Make a proposal ==

{{Admonition_Note|Proposals can only be made during the proposal phase. If the voting cycle is in any other phase, you’ll need to wait for the proposal phase of the next voting cycle to make your proposal.}}
{{Admonition_Note|The process for making a compensation request is largely the same as the process outlined here, but see [[Making a compensation request|this article]] for additional considerations.}}

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please read [[Proposals|this article on proposals]] before submitting a proposal for voting.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq proposals tend to be for significant items, and proposals submitted to the DAO are typically for [[Proposals#Submit_to_the_DAO_.28if_needed.29|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;controversial&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; significant items]].

In &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll find the form to make a new proposal. Pick the type of proposal you want to make from the dropdown, fill the form, and hit &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;.
* Make sure the GitHub handle you put in Bisq matches the GitHub handle on the issue. 
* Also make sure to replace &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; with the GitHub proposal number. For example, if submitting proposal #999 with URL https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/999, the DAO proposal URL should be https://bisq.network/dao-proposals/999.

{{Admonition_Warn|Beware that proposals cannot be edited after being submitted. If you need to make a change, you can delete the proposal and make a new one while the proposal phase is still active, but you’ll need to pay the proposal fee again. Once the proposal phase is over, proposals cannot be added or removed until the next proposal phase. }}

Here&amp;#x27;s how making a generic proposal can look:

[[File:Submit-generic-proposal.png|700px|thumb|left|Submit a generic proposal for DAO voting.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Vote on proposals ==

Once the proposal phase is over, after a short break, the voting phase starts.

You can see all proposals in the current voting cycle in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Browse Open Proposals&lt;/code&gt;.

Click through each proposal to see more details, and then vote—it’s strongly recommended that you only accept or reject proposals you know well and have a strong opinion about.

[[File:Vote-proposal.png|400px|thumb|left|Cast votes for proposals during the blind voting phase.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Submit votes ==

When you’re done selecting your votes, you will need to submit your votes.

[[File:Vote-submit.png|400px|thumb|left|Select voting weight and submit all votes.]]

All votes are submitted in a single ballot. Casting a ballot currently costs 2 BSQ + mining fees.

In addition, to submit your votes, you need to specify a BSQ amount to use for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;voting stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The more BSQ you stake for your vote, the more weight it will carry. This staked BSQ cannot be traded or otherwise transferred until your vote reveal transaction is published.

The software has checks to prevent such BSQ from being spent, but if BSQ staked for voting is somehow spent, the corresponding vote will be rendered invalid.

This is why, as you see in the screenshot to the left, it&amp;#x27;s advisable to use most (but not all) of your BSQ for the voting stake—we left some BSQ available for spending in case we need it for other purposes during the remainder of the voting cycle.

&lt;code&gt;Vote weight from earned BSQ&lt;/code&gt; is BSQ earned from contributing to Bisq: this BSQ is treated slightly differently from BSQ bought on the open market when determining a stakeholder’s voting weight.

{{Admonition_Note|For more details on how voting weight is determined, see the [[DAO_user_reference#Voting_Stake|DAO user reference]].}}

Once you’ve entered a voting stake, go ahead and click &lt;code&gt;Vote on all proposals&lt;/code&gt;.

== Reveal your vote == 

After the blind voting phase is over, you must make sure Bisq goes back online at some point during the vote reveal phase to publish your vote reveal transaction.

Bisq will publish the transaction automatically when it’s online, so you don’t have to actually do anything, and you’ll see a pop-up when the transaction is published.

This transaction includes the key to decrypt your vote from the blind voting phase. It also includes a representation of all votes you’ve received from the network, which is used to determine a consensus of all votes cast on the network. See more details [[DAO_user_reference#Vote_Reveal_Phase|here]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Don’t forget this step! If your vote reveal transaction is not published, your vote cannot be decrypted, and so it cannot be counted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

== Get vote results ==

Once the vote reveal phase is over, results are calculated and the next voting cycle starts.

You can see results of the last voting cycle in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Vote Results&lt;/code&gt;.

== See DAO transactions on a block explorer ==

Since DAO transactions are bitcoin transactions, you can see them on any bitcoin block explorer. But because transactions use BSQ (bitcoin colored in a way that only Bisq understands), ordinary bitcoin block explorers can’t recognize which bitcoin transactions are also BSQ transactions.

Hence [https://explorer.bisq.network BSQ block explorers]. Whenever you do a Bisq DAO transaction, including paying trading fees with BSQ, you can see it on a BSQ block explorer.

Here’s a screenshot of the past few BSQ transactions that took place at the end of Cycle 23:

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Backing up&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; your Bisq data is crucial to ensure you can retain control over trades, disputes, payment accounts, and funds in case of issues with your machine (e.g., drive failure) or Bisq itself (e.g., critical bugs).

All Bisq data is stored right on your computer—it&amp;#x27;s never stored (or even sent) to a central server, so backing it up is your job.

To see how to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;restore&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; data to Bisq, see [[Restoring application data]].

__TOC__

= Back up the entire Bisq data directory =

The safest, quickest, easiest, and most comprehensive thing you can do to safeguard your data is to back up the whole data directory at regular intervals. See the various elements of the data directory detailed [[Data_directory#Data_Directory_Structure|here]].

In addition, to make restoring payment accounts easier, you may want to back up an [[#Back_up_payment_accounts|export of your payment accounts]].

== While Bisq is running ==

Go to &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Backup&lt;/code&gt; and put in a location for your backup to be exported to (note that this section is titled &amp;quot;Backup wallet&amp;quot; in the software but it actually exports the entire data directory).

[[File:Backup-while-running.png|600px|thumb|left|Data directory backup screen.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== While Bisq is closed  ==

When Bisq is closed, you can simply copy the entire data directory and paste it somewhere safe. Find the location of your data directory by clicking on the &lt;code&gt;Open Directory&lt;/code&gt; button (see screenshot above) or see [[Data_directory#Default_Locations|data directory locations here]].

== Encrypt your backup ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Backup files are not encrypted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you’ve set a wallet password, your wallet files will be encrypted, but all your other data will &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; be encrypted. 

We recommend encrypting the whole backup folder with something like gpg, 7-Zip, Cryptomator, etc.

= Back up payment accounts =

If you just want to back up your payment accounts, export them from &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;.

Be advised: exporting your accounts this way only exports metadata. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Aging and signing status are not included&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. To include [[Account_limits|account aging and signing status]], you also need to save the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key&lt;/code&gt; file from your [[Data_directory|data directory]].

Because of the way [[Restoring_application_data#Restore_payment_accounts|restoring payment accounts]] works, it&amp;#x27;s best for most users to back up the whole data directory &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; back up a payment account export.

[[File:Export-payment-accounts.png|600px|thumb|left|Export fiat payment accounts here. You can export altcoin accounts from the Altcoin Accounts tab.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

= Back up your wallet seed =

Please be sure to [[Backing_up_your_wallet_seed|properly back up your wallet seed]].

= Export Tor state =

If you want to carry over a particular onion address (and keep your local reputation), you can replace the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservice&lt;/code&gt; folder in your data directory with the one from your backup.

= Export trade history =

In &lt;code&gt;Portfolio&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;History&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;#x27;ll find an &lt;code&gt;Export to CSV&lt;/code&gt; button to export your trade history.

There&amp;#x27;s no way to import this data back into Bisq, but it can be useful to have a copy of this data for yourself for record-keeping, analysis, etc.

= Export transaction history =

In &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Transactions&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;#x27;ll find an &lt;code&gt;Export to CSV&lt;/code&gt; button to export your trade history.

There&amp;#x27;s no way to import this data back into Bisq, but it can be useful to have a copy of this data for yourself for record-keeping, analysis, etc.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Updating bisq popup.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>541</id><revision><id>2952</id><timestamp>2022-03-16T13:07:38Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Local reputation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a count of how many trades you&amp;#x27;ve done with a peer at a particular onion address. 

The idea is that if a trade with a peer went well, it&amp;#x27;s reasonable to expect your next trade with that peer to go well too, creating a sort of rudimentary reputation indicator while maintaining anonymity.

As you trade on Bisq, you will see a count appear on the avatars of users you&amp;#x27;ve traded with.

[[File:Local-reputation-closeup.png|100px|thumb|left|Local reputation on the offer book.]]

You can reset your local reputation by deleting the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservice&lt;/code&gt; folder in your [[Data directory|data directory]]. Bisq will then generate a new onion address the next time it starts, causing you to look like a new trader to all peers on the network. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do not delete this directory if you have any open offers, trades, or disputes—or you will become unreachable and unable to respond.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Switching to a new data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can help you start with Bisq anew: fresh wallet, new onion address, new keys, etc. It&amp;#x27;s a sort of &amp;quot;factory reset&amp;quot; that makes it like you&amp;#x27;re starting Bisq for the first time.

Upon creating a new data directory, you can restore various parts of a previous data directory (e.g., aged and signed payment accounts).

If you instead wish to only obtain a new wallet, while preserving every other element of your data directory, you can [[Create_a_new_wallet_for_your_data_directory|create a fresh wallet in the same data directory]].

__TOC__

= Why switch to a new data directory? =

It&amp;#x27;s a good idea to switch to a new data directory every so often. 
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Performance&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Bisq uses bitcoinj, an SPV library that is not built for high performance, so wallets get increasingly large with every transaction. Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Stability&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Privacy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see [[local reputation]]).

In addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around [[Troubleshooting_wallet_issues|unusual wallet corruption issues]].

= Make sure you&amp;#x27;re ready to switch =

=== Ensure your existing data directory is backed up ===

[[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_the_entire_Bisq_data_directory|See how here]]. Be sure to also do a [[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_payment_accounts|payment account export]] to make importing payment accounts easier.

=== Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes ===

This is paramount because &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you don&amp;#x27;t want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.

= Send funds =

You will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow. 

There are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.

# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Send Funds&lt;/code&gt;, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you&amp;#x27;ve created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt;).
#* Variation: Use the [[Emergency_wallet|Emergency Wallet Tool]] (&lt;code&gt;Cmd/Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn&amp;#x27;t working.
# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you&amp;#x27;ve created it. This method is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See [[Restoring_your_wallet_from_seed#Restoring_to_a_non-Bisq_wallet|derivation path and other details here]].
# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).
## Start Bisq. 
## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the &lt;code&gt;appName&lt;/code&gt; option. See [[Running_from_the_command_line|how to run Bisq from the command line here]].
##* macOS example command: &lt;code&gt;/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new&lt;/code&gt;
##* Name of the new directory doesn&amp;#x27;t matter. &lt;code&gt;Bisq-new&lt;/code&gt; was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it&amp;#x27;s just a temporary placeholder. You&amp;#x27;ll be changing it back to &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; anyway.
## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.
## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.

= Create new data directory =

If you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:
# Close Bisq.
# Delete (or rename) the &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; data directory (see [[Data_directory#Operating_system_defaults|default locations for your operating system here]]).
# Start Bisq again. Bisq will create a new data directory with a new wallet, new Tor state, etc.
# Send funds from external wallet into Bisq.

If you used method 3 in the previous step: 
# Make sure &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq instances are closed.
# Delete (or rename) the original &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; data directory.
# Rename the newer data directory to &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;.
# Start Bisq normally. Your balance should reflect the BTC you sent to it previously.

= Migrate data from backup =

If you&amp;#x27;d like to restore payment accounts and/or your onion address (e.g., [[local reputation]]), [[Restoring_application_data|see how in this article]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Running from the command line</title><ns>0</ns><id>316</id><revision><id>1454</id><timestamp>2020-06-17T19:34:08Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

You can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;run Bisq from the command line&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; with the following commands. There are several options you can specify—[[Command_line_options|see a rundown here]].

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&lt;languages/&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:1--&gt;
Bisq offers several &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;payment methods&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

&lt;!--T:2--&gt;
Every offer on Bisq designates a payment method for traders to settle payments. The Bisq software does not actually integrate with any payment methods—&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;all non-bitcoin fund transfers are made outside of Bisq software&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

&lt;!--T:3--&gt;
Unlike cryptocurrency transfers, many fiat payment transfers are riddled with flaws and limitations that require Bisq to employ special measures to encourage fair and honest trades. One of these measures is lower per-trade limits, which are covered below. Another key measure is [[Account_limits#Account_signing|account signing]].

&lt;!--T:7--&gt;
__TOC__

== Fiat payment methods == &lt;!--T:8--&gt;

&lt;!--T:9--&gt;
The payment methods vary in chargeback risk, regional availability, transaction size, fees, privacy, verifiability, and other characteristics.
The top consideration for maintaining payment methods is chargeback risk. PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App are not supported on Bisq because chargebacks for payments made with those services are relatively easy.

&lt;!--T:10--&gt;
We welcome suggestions for new payment methods on Bisq, especially for those that enable new markets. Documentation on the criteria and process for adding new payment methods is found [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=re%3Apayment-method&amp;amp;template=add_payment_method.md&amp;amp;title= here]. Please also feel free to make suggestions by reaching out on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] in the #payment-methods channel.

&lt;!--T:11--&gt;
Below is a list of fiat payment methods Bisq currently supports.

&lt;!--T:12--&gt;
&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Note: The maximum trade sizes listed below are not available for most newly-created payment accounts. Please refer to [https://bisq.wiki/Account_signing Account signing] for details on how to enable larger trade sizes for your payment accounts. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Bisq also supports a [https://bisq.network/markets/ variety] of cryptocurrencies for buying and selling bitcoin, like [[XMR]], [[ETH]], [[ZEC]], [[L-BTC]] or [[LTC]].

&lt;!--T:20--&gt;
Because altcoin transfers are irreversible and relatively quick, altcoin trades can be up to 0.5 BTC in size right away (no need to wait for account aging or account signing).

== Penalties ==  
Bisq has [[Trading_rules|Rules]] in place to make the trading process as safe and convenient as possible for all parties involved, and it is important those rules are followed by users.

Penalties are a percentage of the trade amount, deducted from the offending peer&amp;#x27;s security deposit (and when needed, also from trade amount itself) and offered as a compensation to the other peer during the [[Dispute_resolution#Level_2:_Mediation|Dispute resolution process]]
The actual penalty will be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;up to&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the values detailed below, depending on security deposit % and mediator&amp;#x27;s discretion.

100% penalties are for serious violations and will always imply losing the whole amount (trade + deposit).

If two or more penalties are caused by the buyer or seller the penalty amount will be greater of the amounts. Penalties are not cumulative.

Ideally, if good communication is established, peers can use trader chat to agree on a penalty amount to relay to their mediator.

Regardless of any penalty amount proposed the mediation proposal will always leave a peer with at least 5% of trade amount. This is to incentivize the peer to accept the mediation proposal rather than take the trade to arbitration where they will likely lose all of their deposit.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BTC Buyer or Seller issues:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

|-
| 15% || Payment is 48-72 hours late 
|-

|-
| 10% || Wrong payment amount: buyer has the option to correct the amount within the trade window, seller is allowed to cancel the trade with no penalty
|-
| 10% || Using unagreed payment reference. Any unagreed payment reference (also the trade ID) shares the same penalty. &amp;quot;Flowers&amp;quot; could be as bad as &amp;quot;services rendered&amp;quot; depending on every single case
|-
| 10% || Late payment because of low fee for altcoin tx; penalty can be reduced during mediation if buyer uses RBF or similar
|-
| 5% || Payment is up to 24 hours late
|}

&lt;!--
- Release times can&amp;#x27;t be enforced, because at mediation, the last trader to accept the suggestion is the one who decides when the payout is submitted.
- Cannot accept SEPA instant is replaced by buyer or seller&amp;#x27;s penalty &amp;quot;Suggest different payment method - account without mediator&amp;#x27;s acknowledgement.&amp;quot;. This way, an instant SEPA trade could continue as normal SEPA
- All reasons to  cancel a trade are merged, because traders will tend to give the reason that penalizes them less
- I keep the explanation because penalizing a user because their bank asks for info is a controversial matter. I might agree with note 3 but this has been working so far.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;ACH Transfer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, or Automated Clearing House Trasnfer, is a payment method introduced in Bisq v1.8.0. It is primarily used for domestic, low-value payments between participating financial institutions. ACH transfers are one of the two main bank transfer payment methods in the United States, the other being [[Domestic_Wire_Transfer|domestic Wire transfers]].

== What countries offer ACH Transfer? ==

ACH is only available in the United States.  

== What currencies are available for ACH Transfer? ==

ACH only supports transfers of USD.

== What is the maximum trading duration for ACH Transfer? ==

The maximum trade time is 5 days, but most are completed within 2 business days. Financial institutions send ACH transfers in batches. Depending on when the transfer is initiated, it will be received the next business day, by the end of the current day, or in real time.

== What is the maximum BTC limit for ACH Transfer? ==

{{MaxTradeSizeBisq1}}.

== Is ACH Transfer a payment method that can be signed? ==

No, ACH accounts do not require signing.

== How do I set up a ACH Transfer account? ==

Please note that not all banks offer ACH transfers to third parties. It&amp;#x27;s crucial to verify if your bank supports this service. Most banks allow ACH transfers to accounts you own at other institutions. However, they may ask you to confirm two micro-deposits they initiate. This process is not the same as a third-party transfer and Bisq sellers usually won&amp;#x27;t confirm these micro-deposits. Confirming micro-deposits enables your bank to send and receive money from that account, but this isn&amp;#x27;t a third-party transfer. If your bank fully supports third-party ACH transfers, they won&amp;#x27;t ask for micro-deposit verification. ACH transfers are typically provided at a low cost, so be sure to check with your bank about any fees.

== How do I add ACH Transfer as a payment method in Bisq? ==

To add your ACH account to Bisq:

# Head to the top menu and select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
# Then, choose &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;National Currency Accounts&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
# Click on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Add new account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
# Select &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;ACH&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
# Fill in the necessary details.
# If you&amp;#x27;d like, choose to use a custom account name. This can help you manage multiple payment methods in Bisq. It will be visible only to you, like &amp;quot;ACH - Chase Bank - USD - Jane Doe&amp;quot;.
# Once done, click save new account.
# If you have more than one ACH account you wish to add to Bisq you can create different accounts for each.

Ensure all the details are accurate when you add them. Sellers can only confirm payment if the name associated with the incoming ACH transfer matches the account name listed in Bisq.

== How do I buy BTC with my ACH Transfer account? ==

You can buy BTC with ACH on Bisq in 2 ways:

# Make an offer to buy BTC on the USD market.
# Take an offer to buy BTC on the USD market.

When the offer is confirmed, Bisq will provide you with the BTC seller&amp;#x27;s ACH details for you to complete the payment. You should send the payment immediately and confirm you have done so in Bisq by clicking &amp;#x27;payment started&amp;#x27;.

If you have the option to include a payment reference, please leave it blank. If your bank requires one, please just use your name that matches your bank account.

Once the BTC seller receives your payment, they will confirm in Bisq, and your security deposit and your purchased trade amount will be available in your wallet.

== How do I sell BTC with my ACH Transfer account? ==

You can sell BTC with ACH on Bisq in 2 waysː

# Make an offer on the USD market to sell your BTC.
# Take an existing offer on the USD market to sell your BTC.

After the offer is confirmed, Bisq will provide the BTC Buyer with your ACH details. The Buyer should send the payment at their earliest convenience and confirm it in Bisq by clicking &amp;#x27;Payment Started&amp;#x27;.

== Are there any limits for me to be aware of when sending an ACH transfer ==

Your bank may impose limits on the amounts you can send or receive. You should check if your bank has any such limits.

== Are there any fees for me to be aware of when sending an ACH transfer? == 

Fees charged by your bank for sending an ACH transfer can vary and it&amp;#x27;s best to check with them. Fees can also be different depending on the speed of the transfer as some banks offer expedited processing. 

Generally, banks will not charge for receiving ACH transfers, but again, it&amp;#x27;s best to check with your bank since some do charge.

== How does dispute resolution work with ACH transfers? ==

If a dispute occurs, the mediator may ask the buyer to send them information showing that they made the payment of the correct amount to the BTC Seller within the correct time frame. The mediator may also ask the seller to send them information to prove their account details are correct, or in the case of the BTC Buyer making a payment late, or of the wrong amount.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Cash by mail&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (CBM) is one of the most private payment methods on Bisq. 

This payment method has special requirements you should be aware of, so please read this article carefully before doing any cash by mail trades.

__TOC__

= Setting up a CBM account in Bisq =

When setting up cash-by-mail payment account in Bisq, you will be asked to enter the following information:

* Name or nym the package should be addressed to
* Postal address 
* Currency 
* Additional information 

If selling BTC, the name/nym and address fields should be the name you would like to buyer to address the package to. If buying BTC, the name/nym and address fields should be the name the seller or postal service to return the package to in case of any issues.

You can only select one currency for a single cash-by-mail account. If you would like to trade with more than one currency, please create separate accounts for each currency.

Define any special terms, conditions, or details you would like to be displayed with your offers in the &amp;#x27;Additional Information&amp;#x27; field. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Users can see this field &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;before&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; taking the offer by clicking the info icon of the offer.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; 

{{Admonition_Note|Consider setting up separate cash-by-mail accounts for buying and selling so you can specify special instructions for each.}}

{{Admonition_Note|You might want to use a PO Box and a name which is not your real one, instead of registering an account to your own house under your real identity.}}

= Making a CBM offer =

Make sure to state any special terms or conditions in the &amp;#x27;Additional Information&amp;#x27; field of the payment account before making an offer. The person taking the offer will be accepting these terms and conditions by taking the offer.

Please note it is against Bisq rules to use the &amp;#x27;Additional Information&amp;#x27; field to include advertising offers with a way to contact you prior to the trade (e.g. website, phone, email, or Matrix/Keybase/Telegram user name). Doing this can result in a penalty, should someone take your offer and request for you to be penalized.

= Taking a CBM offer =

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Make sure to check the offer maker&amp;#x27;s terms and conditions before taking a CBM offer.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you cannot fulfill the terms, do not take the the offer. If you have specific terms you would prefer, consider making your own offer instead.

= Sending cash in the mail =

Please see the Bisq trade protocol for [[Trading_rules|general trading rules]].

In addition, buyers should:

* Package cash in a tamper-evident cash bag. You can get one at [https://shop.fulmo.org/product/tamper-proof-courier-bags/ the FULMO shop] (the Bisq project gains nothing for providing this link. Fulmo is a friendly member of the Bisq community).
* Place tamper-evident cash bag inside a parcel. AVOID using an envelope where a postal worker would be able to feel a wad of cash as this can lead to stolen cash.
* Address the package to the name and address in the seller&amp;#x27;s cash-by-mail payment account.
* Put a return address in case the package cannot be delivered.
* Use inner and outer packaging addressed the same in case the outer one gets ripped open or damaged by water.
* Seal all packages well, with tape.
* Follow any special requirements and conditions set by the seller.
* Film or take high-resolution photos of the cash packaging process with the address and tracking number already affixed to packaging.
* Send the cash package to the BTC seller with a courier service that requires receipt of delivery to be confirmed by the seller.
* If it&amp;#x27;s available, consider using a courier service that has appropriate insurance in place for any issues with delivery (i.e. USPS Registered Mail, insuring packages up to $50,000).
* Communicate with courier service as required.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please make sure you have all the necessary items arranged &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;before&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; taking an offer (tamper-evident cash bags, other packaging, courier and insurance picked out, etc).&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

= Receiving cash in the mail =

When receiving cash in the mail, you should:

* Film the opening of the package, making sure that the tracking number provided by the sender is visible in the video.
* Follow any special requirements and conditions set by the buyer.
* Communicate with buyer&amp;#x27;s courier service as required.

= Dispute resolution =

Cash-by-mail trades are less verifiable than other fiat trades. This makes handling disputes much harder, so the onus to act honestly is squarely on both peers.

It is highly recommended for peers to make use of Bisq&amp;#x27;s trader chat to communicate directly with one another. This is the most promising way to resolve any issues that may arise during the trade.

Regarding dispute resolution, please note:

* Mediators can consider your case and make a suggestion, but they are NOT guaranteed to help.
* If a mediator is engaged, and if either peer rejects the mediator&amp;#x27;s suggestion, both peers&amp;#x27; funds will be sent to a [https://bisq.wiki/Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction Bisq &amp;#x27;donation&amp;#x27; address], and the trade will effectively be completed.
* If a trader rejects a mediation suggestion and opens arbitration, it could lead to lose both trading and deposit funds.
* Arbitrators will make a decision based on the evidence provided to them. Therefore, please follow and document the above processes to have evidence in case of dispute. For cash-by-mail trades, arbitrator decisions are final, meaning reimbursement requests to the Bisq DAO for any funds lost in cash-by-mail trades will NOT be considered.</text></revision></page><page><title>Making a reimbursement request</title><ns>0</ns><id>266</id><revision><id>3690</id><timestamp>2024-08-25T16:08:04Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

You might need to make a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;reimbursement request&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to the Bisq DAO if a disputed trade cannot be resolved through mediation. This article outlines the steps to make such a request.

{{Admonition_Warn|If you have lost mining fees or trade fees as result of a failed trade please see: [[Failed Trades - Reimbursement of Trade Fees and Miner Fees]]}}

__TOC__

== To be eligible for reimbursement you must make you request within 3 months of the trade ==

Reimbursement requests for trade can only considered by the Fee Reimbursement Agent if the user has opened a reimbursement request within 3 months of which ever is the latest; trade completing, trade failing, mediation summary proposed, arbitration summary received.

If a user would like to submit a reimbursement past this date they must do so through submitting a reimbursement request directly from the DAO and include a reason why they have waited &gt;3 months before submitting their reimbursement request. They would also be expected to do all the work required to put forward their case independently rather than have the Fee Reimbursement Agent / Support Team complete the necessary work on their behalf.

== Ensure no further action can be taken to resolve the dispute ==

Making a reimbursement request to the DAO should be a last resort. 

First make sure to:

* Contact your trade&amp;#x27;s counterparty through the chat in the Bisq program. Traders are not required to respond, but many do, so it&amp;#x27;s worth a try.
* Request mediation in the Bisq program. Mediators typically respond quickly, but they can take up to 2 days to respond. If you don&amp;#x27;t hear back within 2 days, feel free to reach out to your mediator on Matrix. Bisq assigns mediators to trades randomly. To find out which mediator is assigned to your trade, see [[Finding your mediator|this article]].

Your mediator will likely let you know if/when no further action can be taken on the dispute.

== Escalate your case ==

In order to make a reimbursement request, you need to publish the [[Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction|time-locked payout transaction]] signed at the start of your trade. This transaction sends &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;all&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; trade funds (yours and those of the counterparty) to arbitration.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;The only way to do this is to reject your mediator&amp;#x27;s suggestion in Bisq.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; 

To access your mediator&amp;#x27;s suggestion, click the &lt;code&gt;View Proposed Resolution&lt;/code&gt; button:

[[File:View-mediator-suggestion.png|thumb|600px|left|Button to view mediator&amp;#x27;s suggested payout, so that you can reject it and enable arbitration.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Obtain the transaction ID of your published time-locked transaction ==

This transaction proves that your funds are no longer in the multisignature wallet, so it will be important to include this TXID in your reimbursement request (for others to verify).

You&amp;#x27;ll find the transaction details in &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Transactions&lt;/code&gt;, and it will be titled &amp;quot;Refund collateral&amp;quot;:

[[File:Time-locked-payout-tx.png|thumb|600px|left|Where to find the time-locked payout TXID.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Create an issue on GitHub ==

Bisq DAO requests have 2 parts: (1) a GitHub issue with all proposal details and (2) a proposal in the Bisq DAO itself pointing to a GitHub issue.

The GitHub issue needs to be made in Bisq&amp;#x27;s support repository. Voters cannot see the conversations you may have had with your counterparty and with your mediator, so your issue should include the circumstances of your dispute and all relevant details.

* Any other details that would help to convince Bisq stakeholders that your request is legitimate

It&amp;#x27;s important that you tag your mediator so they are alerted of your request and can corroborate your claims. If your mediator doesn&amp;#x27;t reply to your issue within a couple of days, ping them on Matrix to make sure they saw it. Their explicit sign-off will be crucial for DAO voters to approve your request.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Please make sure not to include any sensitive information (e.g., payment account details) of &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;either&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; trade party.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

== Submit your reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO ==

Once you&amp;#x27;ve created the issue, you&amp;#x27;ll need to make the corresponding proposal in the Bisq DAO so stakeholders can vote on it in the next voting phase.

To make the proposal, simply go to &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;, pick &amp;quot;Reimbursement request&amp;quot; in the drop-down, and fill in the details.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Triple-check before hitting &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Bisq DAO proposals are bitcoin transactions, so they cannot be reversed. You can delete a request and make a new one, if you really need to, but you will not get proposal fees back and you must delete before the end of the proposal phase in which the proposal was made.

New proposals can only be made during the proposal phase of a DAO cycle. If the Bisq DAO is not in the proposal phase, you&amp;#x27;ll need to wait for the next proposal phase to begin in order to make your reimbursement request. You&amp;#x27;ll see when the next proposal phase will begin in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;. 

[[File:Make-reimbursement-request-in-bisq-dao.png|600px|thumb|left|Creating reimbursement request proposal in the Bisq DAO.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Sell your newly-issued BSQ for BTC ==

Once the voting phases of the cycle are over, if your request was approved, you&amp;#x27;ll see your newly-issued BSQ in &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;BSQ Wallet&lt;/code&gt;.

If you&amp;#x27;d like to exchange the BSQ for BTC this can be done on the BSQ/BTC market in the Bisq application.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Paxum.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>511</id><revision><id>2647</id><timestamp>2021-11-22T00:11:07Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;L-BTC&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, or Liquid Bitcoin, is a Confidential Asset, fully verifiable, and 1:1 backed BTC token created by [https://liquid.net/ Liquid], a federated sidechain pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain. Liquid is implemented by Elements, an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform based on the Bitcoin codebase created by Blockstream.

A sidechain is a mechanism that allows tokens from one blockchain to be used securely in an independent blockchain which runs in parallel and uses a different set of rules, performance requirements, and security mechanisms. On a sidechain, one can move tokens back to the original chain through a two-way peg. Sidechains enable new functionality that may have security trade-offs or as a way to test new features that may not be ready to use on the parent blockchain. 

These are some new functionalities that Liquid enables:

* Confidential Transactions: hides the amount from the information displayed at the blockchain -- the most important feature for most Bisq users
* Issued Assets: allows issuing tokenized fiat, securities, altcoins or digital collectibles
* Federated consensus mechanism: allows 2- or 3-minute settlement times in normal conditions
* In development: Schnorr signatures, which will improve network privacy and capacity

All addresses in Liquid are blinded by default using Confidential Transactions. The asset and amount of a transaction is hidden to those watching the Liquid sidechain. Bisq users can mix their coins with all of Liquid federation BTC holdings just trading both assets.

== Selling L-BTC ==

Selling L-BTC is like selling any other [[altcoin]]. It just requires an [[Creating_a_payment_account#Creating_an_altcoin_account|L-BTC payment account]] in Bisq.

== Buying L-BTC ==

The trader &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;receiving&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; L-BTC (L-BTC buyer) must be able to generate proof of payment in case of a dispute. Otherwise, Confidential Transactions make it impossible for a third party to verify if a payment was made—so L-BTC buyers must be able to generate a transaction&amp;#x27;s blinding key for mediators or arbitrators in case of disputes.

{{Admonition_Warn|Failing to provide the blinding key to a dispute agent will likely result in losing the dispute case.}}

=== Generate blinding key ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Green Wallet and other custodial wallets can&amp;#x27;t generate blinding keys, so you must use Elements Core to receive L-BTC for Bisq trades.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;  

Install the [https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements Elements Core full node software] (note that this does &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; require running a Bitcoin Core full node) and follow these steps:
# Get the receiving L-BTC address
# Open the GUI console window of your Elements Core full node, or use &lt;code&gt;elements-cli&lt;/code&gt;
# Type the command &lt;code&gt;dumpblindingkey &lt;address&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;address&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the receiving L-BTC address from step 1

The Elements console will return the [https://elementsproject.org/elements-code-tutorial/confidential-transactions#blindingkey blinding key] in hex. This blinding key is what dispute agents will ask for in case an L-BTC trade ends up in dispute.

== FAQ ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How is the price of L-BTC determined?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

L-BTC is a 1:1 BTC pegged token to Bitcoin, so high volatility is not expected. Buyers and sellers make their fixed price orders close to parity. There&amp;#x27;s no price feed with market % based prices for this market.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Why not just use the peg-in and peg-out mechanism to exchange L-BTC and BTC?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

A peg-in transaction (BTC to L-BTC) requires 102 confirmations on the Bitcoin network (17 hours) before funds can be claimed on the Liquid Network. Peg-out requires approval from two-thirds 2/3 Liquid functionaries approval and it takes about 17-35 minutes to complete. Bisq offers private, easy and secure L-BTC on and off-ramp.

== Guidance for dispute agents ==

In order to verify L-BTC trades, install the Elements Core software on your computer from https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/releases, and then:
* Set &lt;code&gt;txindex=1&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;elements.conf&lt;/code&gt; (neither L-BTC sender nor receiver need this setting)
* Wait until Elements fully syncs to the Liquid blockchain

=== Verifying a transaction ===

Obtain information from trading peers:
# Obtain the TXID for the L-BTC transaction (either trading peer can provide this information)
# Obtain the Blinding Key for the receiving L-BTC address from the L-BTC buyer/receiver
# Verify that both the L-BTC address and TXID are visible on https://blockstream.info/liquid

Verify the transaction:
# Open the GUI console window of your Elements Core full node, or use &lt;code&gt;elements-cli&lt;/code&gt;
# Type &lt;code&gt;importaddress &lt;address&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;address&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the L-BTC address of the L-BTC buyer/receiver. This will add the address to your wallet as “watch only” and rescan the entire Liquid blockchain. It might take an hour or longer to complete depending on your computer&amp;#x27;s power.
# After scanning is complete, get details for the L-BTC transaction with &lt;code&gt;gettransaction &lt;TXID&gt; true&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;TXID&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the L-BTC transaction ID. You should see a transaction object, but &amp;quot;details&amp;quot; will be empty since the blinding key is needed to reveal that information.
# Import the blinding key with &lt;code&gt;importblindingkey &lt;address&gt; &lt;blinding key&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# Request transaction details again, and this time they should be visible: &lt;code&gt;gettransaction &lt;TXID&gt; true&lt;/code&gt;</text></revision></page><page><title>Trading BSQ</title><ns>0</ns><id>309</id><revision><id>3605</id><timestamp>2024-06-16T10:57:58Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

== How to obtain BSQ ==

The faster, cheaper, easier, and trustless way to obtain BSQ is through [[BSQ_swaps|BSQ swaps]], available in the Bisq application as the default method when creating an offer to sell BTC for BSQ.

What follows is the previous trading protocol for obtaining BSQ, which has been deprecated in favor of swaps, as it offers no advantages over the former.

= Old trading protocol =


&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Trading BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is very similar to trading any other [[payment_methods#altcoin-payment-methods | altcoin]], but instead of using an external wallet to send and receive funds, you use the [[BSQ#BSQ_Wallet | BSQ wallet]] built in to your Bisq application.

== Why buy or sell BSQ? ==

For traders, using BSQ colored bitcoin to pay trading fees can be a lot cheaper than using plain BTC to pay trading fees. The [[Trading_fees|target discount rate is 50%]], fluctuates with market prices, and is [[Updating_BSQ_trading_fees|re-calibrated on a monthly basis]].

For contributors, BSQ is required to make proposals and cast votes. Contributors are also compensated with BSQ, which can be sold on Bisq for BTC.

== Get your BSQ address ==

In order to create a payment account for trading BSQ, you&amp;#x27;ll first need a BSQ address.

Go to &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;BSQ wallet&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Receive&lt;/code&gt; and click the copy icon in the right corner to copy the BSQ address to receive the BSQ payment.

[[File:Get-bsq-address.png|600px|thumb|left|Get BSQ address.]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Create a payment account ==

Once you&amp;#x27;ve found your BSQ address, create a BSQ payment account at &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Altcoin Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. 

Click &lt;code&gt;Add New Account&lt;/code&gt;, pick &lt;code&gt;BSQ&lt;/code&gt; in the dropdown, and paste your BSQ address.

== Buy or sell  BSQ ==

To trade BSQ you can either make an offer or take an existing offer just as you would with any other payment method.

Since v1.8.0, Bisq offers [[BSQ_swaps|atomic swaps for BSQ/BTC trades]], which means you can buy and sell BSQ for BTC with only a single on-chain transaction. This means mining fees are greatly reduced, and trades are virtually instant (!).

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Monero (XMR)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is one of the most active markets on Bisq. This article covers some things you should know when trading it.

= Instant payment accounts =

By default, all altcoins trades on Bisq have trade periods of 1 day. But you can set up an [[Creating_a_payment_account#Instant_accounts|Altcoins Instant account]] on Bisq for 1-hour trade periods.

= Proving payments =

Some details of XMR transactions are not publicly available on the blockchain. In order for a mediator or arbitrator to handle disputes, the XMR seller must make sure they send XMR using a wallet that provides the following 3 items to prove the payment was made:
# transaction key (Tx Key, Tx Secret Key, or Tx Private Key)
# transaction ID (Tx ID or Tx Hash)
# recipient&amp;#x27;s address

This information can be found in the following wallets: official Monero GUI and CLI wallets, MyMonero, Exodus (desktop), Cake Wallet, and Monerujo (mobile):

* Monero GUI: on the Transactions tab.
* Monero CLI: use the command &lt;code&gt;get_tx_key &lt;TXID&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The flag &lt;code&gt;store-tx-info&lt;/code&gt; must be enabled (it&amp;#x27;s enabled by default in new versions).
* Other wallets: go to transaction history and look for transaction key (sometimes called &amp;quot;tx key&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;secret key&amp;quot;) and destination address in a sent transaction. For Cake Wallet, the &amp;quot;Save recipient address&amp;quot; option must be enabled in settings.

If you are using another wallet not mentioned above, be sure you can still access the 3 items mentioned above.

Since transaction keys and destination addresses are stored in Monero wallet software and not available anywhere else, be careful not to delete or restore your Monero wallet before a Bisq trade is complete. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Failure to provide the required transaction data will result in losing disputes.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

= Verifying payments =

To verify that a certain sum of Monero was sent to a specific address:
* Monero GUI: change wallet to Advanced mode and go to &lt;code&gt;Advanced&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Prove/check&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Check Transaction&lt;/code&gt;
* Monero CLI: use the command &lt;code&gt;check_tx_key &lt;TXID&gt; &lt;TXKEY ADDRESS&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

* [https://monero.com/explorer Monero.com explorer] - working checked 17.10.23
* [https://p2pool.io/explorer/ P2pool explorer] - working checked 17.10.23
* [https://xmrchain.net/ XMR Chain] - working checked 17.10.23
* [https://www.exploremonero.com/receipt Explore Monero website] - working checked 26.11.23
* [https://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html XMR Check Transaction tool] - not working checked 17.10.23

If you still have questions, see [https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html this guide on the Monero home page] or ask a question on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/monerosupport/ Monero support subreddit].

= Auto-confirming trades =

Auto-confirming trades verify receipt of XMR payment automatically. Typically, XMR buyers must check their wallet and manually mark a payment as received in Bisq. Auto-confirming trades do this automatically, making trades quicker and more efficient for both traders.

This feature is currently available for XMR trades where:
* the XMR seller provides a valid transaction key or viewkey
* the XMR buyer has auto-confirming trades turned on in Bisq settings

Auto confirming works very well most of the time. However on some occasions users might be manually required to confirm payment, for example then the incorrect data is supplied by the BTC buyer.

By default auto-confirming trades is turned on in the Bisq app, if you wist to turn if off it can be done in Settings &gt; Preferences:

[[File:XMR auto confirm.png|frame|left|XMR auto confirm]]


















== How it works ==

=== XMR Seller ===

The XMR seller will get a pop-up upon clicking &lt;code&gt;Payment Sent&lt;/code&gt; asking for the XMR tx ID and XMR tx key. 

[[File:Autoconfirm-xmrseller-input.png|600px|thumb|left|The XMR seller can choose to enter this information, or not.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The trader can choose to enter this information, or not. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;It is not mandatory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. If the trader chooses not to, they&amp;#x27;ll be informed that their trading peer will not be able to use auto-confirm.

=== XMR Buyer ===

The XMR buyer must have auto-confirm turned on in Bisq settings. 

[[File:Auto-confirm-status.png|500px|thumb|left|Auto-confirm status on the trade screen. In this particular instance, the XMR seller didn&amp;#x27;t specify the information needed for auto-confirm to work.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Explorer nodes are queried every 90 seconds for 12 hours. If 12 hours pass without success, auto-confirm fails for the trade. If Bisq receives just 1 failure of any kind (related to transaction, network issues, etc), auto-confirm is considered failed. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;This does not mean the XMR transaction was invalid.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; It just means the user should check the transaction manually.

The user can mark the transaction as received any time by clicking &lt;code&gt;Confirm Payment Receipt&lt;/code&gt; themselves, and auto-confirm will stop running for that trade and the trade will be completed normally.

{{Admonition_Note|If mediation or arbitration is open for a trade, auto-confirm will not confirm the trade.}}

== Settings ==

On the Bisq settings screen, you can set:
* Maximum amount of BTC that can be confirmed per trade (default: 1 BTC)
* Monero Explorer node address (default: nodes run by Bisq contributors; see [[#Set_up_your_own_node|below]] for how to run your own)
* Number of required confirmations (default: 5)

Please note that changes to these settings are applied immediately only for trades for which payment hasn&amp;#x27;t been started yet. Restart Bisq for updated settings to apply to all trades.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Changing the required number of confirmations is an exception: it takes effect immediately for all trades.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Disabling the auto-confirm feature altogether also takes effect immediately. But re-enabling the feature will only take effect on trades for which payment hasn&amp;#x27;t been started yet; restart Bisq for the auto-update feature to apply to all trades.

[[File:Screenshot from 2020-09-03 12-41-19-touched.png|600px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Monero Explorer nodes ==

By default, the Bisq auto-confirm feature relies on [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/107 a few Monero Explorers operated by Bisq contributors], but we highly recommend you to run your own Monero Explorer node at home. Don&amp;#x27;t trust, verify!

=== Set up your own node ===

For maximum privacy and security, users are recommended to run their own Monero Explorer node for verifying receipt of funds.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ swaps&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; allow [[BSQ]] colored bitcoin and BTC to be traded atomically: instantly, risklessly, with less fees, and with no special Bisq account setup required.

__TOC__

== Process ==

With the BSQ swap protocol, BSQ and BTC can be traded in a single transaction without much of the baggage of the conventional trade protocol.

From a user&amp;#x27;s perspective, the process is rather seamless. No special payment accounts need to be created. The offer maker creates the offer (BSQ is default trade currency).

[[File:Create-bsq-swap-offer.png|600px|thumb|left|Creating a BSQ swap offer.]]

As long as the offer maker has enough of what they want to trade in their wallet (either BTC or BSQ), the offer will be live and visible on the network. If the relevant wallet balance ever goes below the amount required to complete the swap, the swap offer automatically deactivates.
* if a user creates a swap offer to sell 1000 BSQ, the offer will remain live as long as their BSQ wallet has more than 1000 BSQ
* if a user creates a swap offer to buy 0.5 BTC, the offer will remain live as long as their Bisq BTC wallet has more than 0.5 BTC

Offers can still be activated or deactivated manually in &lt;code&gt;Portfolio&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;My Open Offers&lt;/code&gt; as usual.

Taken offers show in a new &lt;code&gt;BSQ Swap Trades&lt;/code&gt; tab on the &lt;code&gt;Portfolio&lt;/code&gt; screen.

Of course, this trade protocol can only work while both users are online, but Bisq offers can only be taken when both maker and taker are online anyway, and these trades can be settled almost instantly so there is no further expectation that users be online for any particular amount of time (e.g. for 1 hour with [[Payment_methods#Altcoin_payment_methods|instant altcoins offers]]).

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear:both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Troubleshooting ==

Since the protocol is trustless, BSQ swaps do not require Bisq&amp;#x27;s conventional [[dispute resolution]]. 

Rarely, an invalid transaction could be committed to your wallet. In such a case, you will need to [[Resyncing SPV file|resync your SPV file]] to get rid of it.

== Background ==

=== Transaction structure ===

Here we cover the basic mechanics of BSQ swaps.

BTC buyers and sellers need to pay BTC mining fees and BSQ trading fees, but the BSQ swap protocol simplifies the transaction by only having BTC inputs for BTC sellers and BSQ inputs for BSQ sellers. The appropriate deductions are made from the outputs (e.g. the BTC buyer/BSQ seller gets BTC with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted; similarly, the BTC seller/BSQ buyer gets BSQ with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted).

Now let us examine an example trade to see the structure of such a transaction.

This is how a transaction for a 1 BTC/50,000 BSQ swap with a 0.5 BSQ maker fee and 1.5 BSQ taker fee would look. We estimate the buyer&amp;#x27;s share of the mining fee to be 2000 sats and the seller&amp;#x27;s share of the mining fee to be 2500 sats.

Assuming Alice makes an offer to buy BTC (sell BSQ) and Bob takes her offer (making him BTC seller/BSQ buyer):

* Alice&amp;#x27;s BSQ input(s): min. 50,000 BSQ + 0.5 BSQ trade fee
* Bob&amp;#x27;s BTC input(s): min. 1 BTC + 2500 sat - 150 sat (his BSQ trade fee will be used for mining fee, so he needs a bit less of a mining fee)
* Bob&amp;#x27;s BSQ payout output: 50,000 BSQ - 1.5 BSQ trade fee
* Alice&amp;#x27;s BSQ change output: xxx BSQ - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact
* Alice&amp;#x27;s BTC payout output: 1 BTC - 2000 sat miner fee + 50 sat from BSQ fee
* Bob&amp;#x27;s BTC change output: yyy BTC - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact

=== Spam prevention ===

With the conventional Bisq trade protocol, the maker fee transaction acts as a spam prevention measure: you cannot create an offer without spending bitcoin.

The BSQ swap protocol has no such transaction, so instead, a proof-of-work (POW) mechanism is used. The difficulty level (number of leading zeros) is set in the filter. When creating an offer, the maker does the required POW and attaches the resulting data to their offer. Each node verifies the POW and only shows offers with valid POW.

If POW difficulty is increased, offer makers must re-do their POW in the background and republish their offers. Old offers are removed from the network and new offers with new POW are added.

Each offer has a counter appended to its offer ID (after the version number, in the full offer ID) each time a new POW is completed. This enables each re-published offer with new POW to have a new offer ID that looks the same to users (since the short offer ID doesn&amp;#x27;t change).

At first, POW difficulty will be set to a very low value so users do not notice anything (low milliseconds on modern laptop hardware), but will be increased as needed.</text></revision></page><page><title>Restoring your wallet from seed</title><ns>0</ns><id>100</id><revision><id>1525</id><timestamp>2020-06-19T01:55:30Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

You can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;restore your wallet from seed&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to recover your funds in unusual circumstances when nothing else is working (e.g., if a data directory &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; its backups become corrupted).

Note that such a recovery only restores funds (BTC and BSQ) but does not restore any other Bisq data such as payment accounts, open disputes, etc. This data is stored in the Bisq data directory. Furthermore, restoring from seed does not restore [https://docs.bisq.network/dao-user-reference.html#voting-stake reputation value] earned from contributing to Bisq.

__TOC__

== Restoring to a Bisq wallet ==

Before restoring from seed, please try [[Troubleshooting_wallet_issues#Restore_a_wallet_backup|restoring your wallet from a backup]] first.

To restore a wallet using seed words, go to &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Wallet Seed&lt;/code&gt;, enter the seed words and date in the &amp;quot;Restore wallet from seed words&amp;quot; section, and then click &lt;code&gt;Restore Wallets&lt;/code&gt;.

: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;{{Wallet_date_explainer}}&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Bisq will then restart and start to rebuild your wallet state. If you see a zero balance for BTC and/or BSQ after restoring from seed, wait until the program is done syncing with the Bitcoin network. You&amp;#x27;ll know syncing is done when the green bar on the bottom right labeled &amp;quot;Synchronizing With Bitcoin Mainnet (using Tor) / Synchronizing DAO&amp;quot;  goes away.

[[File:Restore-from-seed.png|600px|thumb|left|Go here to restore a Bisq wallet from seed.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Things to know:

* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;You should only restore from seed into a new Bisq wallet.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;
* If your goal is merely to transfer BTC or BSQ to another Bisq instance, it&amp;#x27;s best to simply send the funds to the new instance with a transaction.
* You can restore BTC funds to an external wallet like Electrum, but restoring BSQ on a non-Bisq wallet is highly discouraged and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; supported. The rules to form valid BSQ transactions are rather complex, and even the slightest error can result in invalid BSQ.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

This &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;DAO user reference&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; covers practical details on the workings of the Bisq DAO for traders and contributors.

Some basic DAO functions like paying trading fees, making proposals, and voting may not seem complex, but implementing these functions on peer-to-peer networks (Bitcoin and Bisq’s own P2P network) adds extensive technical complexity.

Immense technical challenges aside, the practical constraints of the Bisq DAO are not trivial. One requirement is complete decentralization of decision-making (no persons with special powers) and funding (no central wallets or accounts to store and distribute funds). Another is that incentives must be so well-aligned that stakeholders are naturally motivated to grow and support the DAO merely by acting rationally—there are no managers to promote you (or fire you).

And perhaps most critically, the DAO needs to be secure: safe from hackers and scammers trying to take advantage of the DAO and its users.

__TOC__

== BSQ Token ==

Contributors earn BSQ for working on Bisq, and traders spend BSQ to trade on Bisq. This basic dynamic is covered in [[Introduction_to_the_DAO|the DAO introduction article]] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvOZlIDYEQ&amp;amp;list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e in this video series].

But what actually &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;is&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; BSQ, and where does it come from?

A single BSQ token is denominated as 100 satoshis (i.e., it&amp;#x27;s represented on the Bitcoin blockchain as 0.00000100 BTC). This bitcoin is &amp;#x27;colored&amp;#x27; with additional properties that causes Bisq software to recognize it as BSQ.

BSQ can only be created in one of two ways:

# through the genesis distribution (detailed below)
# through an issuance transaction (compensation request or reimbursement request)

=== BSQ Genesis Distribution ===

The Bisq DAO did not launch with a supply of zero BSQ tokens. An initial supply of BSQ tokens was created to account for all the contributions to the Bisq project before the mainnet launch of the Bisq DAO.

These contributions can be divided into 2 segments.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;1. Before October 2017&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In the early days of the project, before Bisq tracked compensation requests and voting results, Bisq collected donations. In October 2017, as part of the implementation of the Phase Zero plan, it was decided that 2.5 BTC of all donations would be distributed back to these patrons as BSQ where each person would receive an amount proportional to their prior contributions.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;2. After October 2017&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In October 2017, the plan outlined in the Phase Zero plan went into effect. Subsequent contributions to Bisq were [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues documented on GitHub] and stakeholders voted to approve those contributions [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlXDswj3251BPCOcII-UyWlX7o7jMkfYBE-IZ5te5Ck on this spreadsheet].

The genesis BSQ distribution issued the sum of both these segments of past contributions.

Ultimately, the genesis transaction issued [https://mempool.space/bisq/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 3,657,480 BSQ to over 200 past contributors]. You can see [https://mempool.space/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 the corresponding Bitcoin transaction here].

Addresses were confirmed over email, Slack, Twitter, and on these two GitHub threads: [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/260 one], [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/263 two].

== Bisq DAO ==

=== Technical Overview ===

There are 2 key points to note about how the Bisq DAO works.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;1. Every DAO action is an on-chain Bitcoin transaction.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; 

Every DAO action requires BSQ, and since BSQ is bitcoin, every DAO action is also recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. As noted above, this does NOT mean you should try to form your own BSQ transactions. But it does mean that every action you take on the Bisq DAO is immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain, publicly verifiable, and virtually impossible to reverse.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;2. Bitcoin provides transaction integrity, and Bisq&amp;#x27;s own P2P network provides storage.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

DAO actions such as making proposals and voting include extra data such as text and links that don&amp;#x27;t belong on the Bitcoin blockchain. This extra data is stored on Bisq&amp;#x27;s own P2P network (literally, Bisq users&amp;#x27; hard drives). A hash of that extra data is included in the &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; output of the corresponding Bitcoin transaction. Then, the Bitcoin transaction ID is added to the extra data and broadcast to peers on the Bisq network.

You can visualize it like this:

[[File:Bisq-dao-data-model.png|thumb|left|600px|How Bisq DAO data is stored]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Storing a hash of the extra data on the Bitcoin blockchain ensures any attempts to manipulate it will fail, since the hash of the manipulated data will change and then not match the hash recorded in the corresponding Bitcoin transaction.

{{Admonition_Note|There&amp;#x27;s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here, since the Bitcoin transaction ID can only be known after the Bitcoin transaction is made, and the hash of a data object can only be made once the Bitcoin transaction ID is known. 

To get around this, the data object is hashed with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; in place of the Bitcoin transaction ID, and the Bitcoin transaction ID is added afterward. Later, when the integrity of the data object needs to be validated, the Bitcoin transaction ID is replaced with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; before the data object is hashed.}}

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;For a more thorough treatment of the technical workings of the Bisq DAO, see the [[DAO_technical_overview|technical overview article]].&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=== Voting Cycle ===

Voting cycles are timed to last about 1 month. Duration is measured in blocks, so actual calendar/clock times may vary.

==== Proposal Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;3600 blocks, about 24 days&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

During this time, Bisq stakeholders (contributors and traders) can make proposals. It is not possible to edit a proposal, but it is possible to remove a proposal and submit a corrected one (only during this phase).

There is a small fee to make proposals to discourage spam. Fees for proposals that are removed are not reimbursed.

Proposals requesting the issuance of new BSQ will also require a small amount of BTC to be included in the proposal transaction so there is BTC to &amp;#x27;color&amp;#x27; into BSQ. The spec requires 100 satoshis per BSQ token, so a request for 1000 BSQ will require 1000 × 100 = 100,000 satoshis.

Keep in mind that the actual BSQ you end up with will be net the proposal fee: if your request for 1000 BSQ is approved, and if the proposal fee is 2 BSQ, you will end up with 998 BSQ in your wallet.

For compensation requests, please make sure you follow [[Compensation#Contributor|established conventions and recommendations]].

If the proposal phase ends before you can make your proposal, simply wait and make your proposal in the next proposal phase.

===== Other Details =====

As illustrated in the image above, proposal transactions are published on the Bitcoin network and proposal data objects are broadcast on the Bisq P2P network. The Bitcoin transaction includes a hash of the proposal data object.

After the proposal phase is over, there is a break of 150 blocks (about 1 day) to review and discuss proposals before voting begins.

==== Blind Voting Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;450 blocks, about 3 days&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

You may approve, reject, or abstain from casting a vote on proposals. It is highly recommended that you only approve or reject proposals for which you can make a well-informed decision.

It is not necessary to have made a proposal to be able to vote—any stakeholder (anyone with BSQ) can participate in voting.

Once you have made your selections, you must specify a stake and publish your votes.

Votes cannot be changed once they are published.

===== Voting Stake =====

Your voting weight is determined by 2 factors: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;reputation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (how much BSQ you&amp;#x27;ve earned), and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (how much of your owned BSQ you allot to your vote) that you specify in your vote transaction.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Reputation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is the amount of BSQ earned by doing work for the Bisq network, independent of the amount of BSQ spent or sold. So if Alice earns 10,000 BSQ by working on Bisq, and she sells 8,000 BSQ for BTC to pay her bills, her reputation value remains 10,000 BSQ. Caveat: reputation decays over time. BSQ earned decays linearly over a period of 2 years as soon as it&amp;#x27;s earned. So the reputation value of Alice&amp;#x27;s 10,000 BSQ is 5,000 BSQ one year after she earns it, and zero two years later.

Reputation cannot be specified when making a vote transaction—it&amp;#x27;s automatically calculated for the user from their past contributions.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is the literal amount of BSQ specified for the vote transaction. This is BSQ you own that you would like to devote to your vote. The more BSQ you allot, the more weight your vote will hold. BSQ specified for stake is unspendable for the duration of the voting cycle.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Total voting weight is the sum of reputation value and specified stake.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

BSQ earned is worth more than BSQ bought. The idea is that there is no better measure of good-will and dedication to the project than actually working on the project. The arrangement still allows people who buy into the project considerable influence, while hopefully minimizing the potential of whales with bad intentions from buying their way in and sabotaging the project.

===== Other Details =====

Votes are published on the Bitcoin network and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;encrypted&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; vote data objects are broadcast on the Bisq P2P network (hence the term &amp;#x27;blind&amp;#x27; vote). The Bitcoin transaction includes a hash of the vote data object. BSQ specified for voting stake is also specified in this transaction, and cannot be spent until the vote reveal transaction is published.

Following the end of the blind voting phase, there is a break of 10 blocks to protect against reorgs.

==== Vote Reveal Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;450 blocks, about 3 days&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

No action is required of the user during this phase aside from having the Bisq software online at some point during the vote reveal phase so it can publish the vote reveal transaction.

You will see a pop-up in the UI when the transaction has been published.

===== Other Details =====

Only a Bitcoin transaction is made in this phase—no additional data is broadcast to the Bisq P2P network.

This transaction includes 2 items:

# the key to decrypt the votes cast in the blind voting phase
# a hash of the list of voting data objects received by the Bisq node making the transaction (ordered by transaction ID; details [[#Determining_Consensus|below]]

One of the inputs to this transaction is the BSQ reserved for stake, so once this transaction is published, that BSQ becomes spendable again.

If a user fails to make their vote reveal transaction, their vote is rendered invalid.

Again, for protection against reorgs, there is a break of 10 blocks after this phase is over.

==== Vote Result Phase ====

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;10 blocks, about 100 minutes&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

This phase is more of a trigger, so allotting 10 blocks is more for consistency than a hard requirement.

In this phase, Bisq nodes calculate vote results from proposals, voting stake, and votes (which can now be decrypted from the vote reveal transactions).

===== Determining Consensus =====

We can trust that all Bisq nodes will get the same data from the Bitcoin blockchain. However, we cannot be sure that all Bisq nodes have obtained all corresponding data from the Bisq P2P network. It is critical that any potential inconsistencies be handled before determining vote results, otherwise, vote results may differ.

This is why each Bisq node includes a hash of the list of the voting data objects it has received in its vote reveal transaction. While a hash of vote data objects is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain for integrity, it&amp;#x27;s not guaranteed that every &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;voting data object itself&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is actually delivered to every Bisq node.

So, when calculating vote results, the majority hash from the vote reveal transactions (majority by voting stake) is considered to be the authoritative representation of votes for the whole network. Vote result calculations are based on this uniform determination, ensuring consensus across the network.

{{Admonition_Note|&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;This majority hash must have at least 80% of the vote stake&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;—otherwise the whole voting cycle is invalidated and all proposals are rejected. Such inconsistencies should be exceptional, as they would indicate a significant problem with P2P network stability. 

This 80% threshold is also a security measure, as only an attacker with at least 80% of the total stake in a voting cycle could succeed.}}

This threshold was tested in Cycle 20. The majority hash lacked the requisite 80% voting stake consensus because of Tor network issues, so results were invalidated, and there was zero issuance. See [https://bisq.network/blog/cycle-20-results/ more details here].

== Note on Unexpected Situations ==

Great care has been taken to make sure that there are no opportunities for the Bisq DAO to be exploited by scammers, hackers, or others with bad intentions.

Much expertise and theory went into the Bisq DAO&amp;#x27;s conception, implementation was careful, and testing was thorough. The resulting software is the best expression of the intention of these collective efforts, but it may not be infallible.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;We say this to establish that Bisq DAO code is not law.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; It has clear intentions, and every effort will be made to fix unintended results.

While we hope nothing will be catastrophic enough to require it, hard forks, confiscation, and new issuances are options to deal with extreme scenarios. BSQ trading and DAO operations can be halted through an alert message from the lead developer. Such messages may be ignored by users if they think the measure is being abused, but ignoring such messages in a situation where the measure &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;is&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; justified may exclude the user from reimbursement in case of losses.</text></revision></page><page><title>DAO technical overview</title><ns>0</ns><id>225</id><revision><id>2140</id><timestamp>2021-04-09T13:37:39Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

In this &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;technical overview&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, you will see:
* what BSQ tokens actually are, how they’re created, and how they’re destroyed
* the various functions of the Bisq DAO and how BSQ enables them

Several example transactions are included so you can explicitly see the processes.

== BSQ token ==

BSQ is a colored coin based on Bitcoin. One BSQ is represented by 100 bitcoin satoshis.

The colored coin concept does not require OpReturn data but uses the transaction graph to determine if a tx output originates in either the genesis tx or an issuance transaction.

BSQ inherits all the transaction rules from Bitcoin and adds some additional rules. Even though BSQ transactions do not require &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt;, it will be used for certain specialized transactions (voting, compensation requests, etc). Aside from the ancestry to the genesis or an issuance transaction, there is another important rule: the outputs are parsed in a way that the first outputs are interpreted as BSQ as long there is sufficient BSQ value available from the inputs. So the order of BSQ and BTC outputs is essential! For inputs the order is irrelevant. Any violation of those rules would make BSQ invalid. There are many more details which are not currently covered in this document.

We use the Bisq P2P network as a carrier for content-rich data like that of proposals or voting. The blockchain is used for timestamping that data. Both the P2P network data and the tx are linked together and are used for creating network consensus.

BSQ is a result of blockchain-related data and P2P network data.

== Infrastructure ==

The Bisq DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data as well as on data from the Bisq P2P network. Each Bisq application verifies the rules of the DAO. The degree of trust to data delivered from other nodes can be determined by the user. Running a full DAO node requires running bitcoind with RPC enabled. The DAO state can be rebuilt from the genesis transaction. The only remaining trusted entity are then the seed nodes which deliver past P2P network data. As seed node operators are bonded, risk for abuse is very limited. There are (at the moment) 8 seed nodes and all need to be in consensus on P2P network data. The user can see the consensus in the application (Network Monitor tab).

=== Nodes ===

A user can decide to run the application as lite node or full node. By default it runs as lite node as that does not require any additional setup.

==== Full nodes ====

A fully-validating BSQ node requires a Bitcoin Core node to verify blockchain data. RPC is used for communication. Setup details are in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dao-setup.md source code documentation].

Full nodes receive a notification from Bitcoin Core at each new block, scan the block for BSQ transactions and broadcast those to the Bisq P2P network. Every transaction with any BSQ input or output (issuance) is considered a BSQ transaction. The full node also listens to network messages from lite nodes which request BSQ blocks from a certain block height. The full node sends back the list of all blocks since the requested height. The bandwidth requirements for this will depend on the number of BSQ transactions, but rough estimations suggest that there will be no considerable issues. Bisq seed nodes are used as full nodes since those are the first nodes to which a user gets connected and we can use the existing connection to transmit the additional data early in the startup process.

==== Lite nodes ====

Most users will likely operate in lite node mode. They have to trust the seed node operators that they are not all colluding and holding data back. If at least one operator is honest the lite node can detect a conflict and would re-validate each block from the last snapshot or even from the genesis block. The UI will notify the user about conflicting data from seed nodes.

At startup, a lite node requests the missing BSQ blocks from the seed node and then validates those blocks to achieve a local state of valid and unspent BSQ outputs. In case of chain splits it can be that one of the seed nodes is on another chain and conflicting blocks get propagated. This would trigger a re-validation of all blocks from the latest snapshot for the lite node. The last received block would be considered the current state but the user will see a message saying there are conflicts (and that  it is recommended to wait for more than one confirmation before considering a BSQ transaction as valid). Only after all full nodes (seed nodes) have the same state again will the lite node exit the &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot; state. If the user waits for a sufficiently high number of confirmations (4-6) he will not risk that his validation was based on an orphaned chain and that he could become victim of a double spend.

=== Seed nodes ===

Seed nodes act as providers for P2P network data and filtered blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain for lite nodes. When a node starts, it requests all P2P network data from several seed nodes.

=== External DAO monitor ===

Monitoring of DAO-related data and infrastructure will be added to [https://monitor.bisq.network/ Bisq monitoring]. This should help us spot any potential consensus or network conflict early.

This is not deployed at the moment, but will be integrated soon.

=== BSQ block explorer ===

[https://explorer.bisq.network/ BSQ block explorers] show all BSQ transactions with some metadata (transaction type, etc). It gives also some statistical data about the network. It is a very basic version at the moment, but we are working on a more sophisticated version. Any BSQ transaction can be looked up in a normal Bitcoin block explorer as well, but of course those explorers will not show any DAO-related context. If looking up a BSQ address on a normal Bitcoin block explorer, a user needs to remove the &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; prefix so the address is considered a valid BTC address.

== BSQ integration in Bisq ==

The Bisq DAO and BSQ are fully integrated into the Bisq UI. It comes with a BSQ wallet and UI for creating proposals, participating in voting, and taking part in other DAO functions.

=== Wallet ===

The Bisq application provides an integrated BSQ wallet with basic features for receiving and sending BSQ, as well as a transaction history screen. The wallet is based on [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki BIP 44] and uses [https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md registered coin type 142]. This provides extra protection against the risk of accidentally using the BSQ wallet as a BTC wallet (e.g., when restoring from seed words). To avoid users from needing to backup 2 different sets of seed words, we use the same seed for both the BSQ and the BTC wallets, even though they are stored in different files. To further avoid mixing BSQ with normal Bitcoin, we use a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; as address prefix for BSQ addresses in the user interface. Internally that prefix does not exist, as a BSQ address is a normal BTC address, and BSQ transactions are normal BTC transactions.

BSQ token transactions and balances are represented inside the application but there is also a web-based [https://explorer.bisq.network/ BSQ block explorer].

A BSQ transaction is valid only after a blockchain confirmation. However, for better usability, we allow users to spend their own change outputs. This involves no risk, as a user would render all follow-up transactions invalid if he tries to double-spend. Unconfirmed BSQ received from others is not spendable.

=== Application internal DAO monitor ===

Inside the application we maintain a hash chain of states and P2P network data. The overall DAO state gets hashed at each new block which contains the previous hash, thus forming a chain of hashes. If the last hash is correct, all the previous must be correct as well. Each node receives the last 10 hashes from seed nodes and compares it with its local hash. If there is any conflict, it shows a warning and requests to rebuild the DAO state. At each new block, each peer broadcasts its local hash to its neighbors. That way, the node also receives hashes from normal peers.

Similar to DAO states, we also maintain a hash chain for proposal data and blind vote data. These hashes are created only once per voting cycle at an appropriate block height (i.e., when it is expected that the whole network has received all data).

There are valid cases when consensus could be temporarily broken. In case of a chain split, nodes can have different DAO states, as the Bitcoin block hash is part of the data, and if 2 nodes are on a different chain they will have different block hashes.

In case some P2P network data was not distributed well in the network, there may be temporary conflicts of the relevant hash chains. An application restart should usually resolve such issues. If not, rebuilding the DAO state forces all P2P network data to be reloaded.

=== Snapshots ===

To avoid reevaluating all history at each startup, we use a snapshot mechanism.

Every 20 blocks a snapshot mechanism is triggered. The current state is cloned and kept in memory, and if a previous clone exists, it is persisted. At the next snapshot trigger event, the last clone is persisted and a new clone is cached. In this way, the snapshot is always at least 20 blocks old.

The lite node requests the blocks since the latest snapshot only, so that will usually be 20-40 blocks (maximum). The only exception to this is on first startup after a new install, when a lite node only has the snapshot shipped with the binary—in this case, requested blocks might consume a bit more bandwidth.

If we maintain a monthly release schedule, there can be about 4500 blocks in a month, but even with that we expect not more than 1-5 MB of bandwidth to receive the initial blockchain data.

=== Snapshots shipped in releases ===

Each application release is updated with a recent snapshot version of the DAO state. This data will be used for new users who have not created their own snapshot yet. This saves new users from needing to download all historical data and rebuilding DAO state from genesis.

The user still can rebuild from genesis if he does not want to trust that developers have shipped a correct snapshot. Any discrepancy would be easily detected.

== Blockchain-related data ==

One part of the DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data. We only use the blockchain for timestamping. Transactions do not carry content-rich data—this data is stored on the Bisq P2P network.

List of possible BSQ transaction types:

* Genesis tx
* Transfer BSQ tx
* Trade fee tx
* Proposal tx
* Compensation request tx
* Reimbursement request tx
* Blind vote tx
* Vote reveal tx
* Lockup tx
* Unlock tx
* Asset listing fee tx
* Proof of burn tx

In addition, a transaction can be unverified, invalid or irregular.

Unverified is the default state for all unconfirmed BSQ transactions. Validation is done once a tx is confirmed.

Invalid transactions are transactions which have violated validation rules. BSQ are destroyed in such transactions.

Irregular transactions are transactions which are invalid with their intended use but have not destroyed their BSQ. An example is a proposal tx which got confirmed too late (not in proposal phase) and therefore is invalid as a proposal tx, but the BSQ is still valid to be spent.

=== Genesis tx ===

BTC from the donation address was used to fund the input for the genesis tx. The genesis tx issued 3,657,480 BSQ, which is equivalent to 3.65748 BTC. The amount of 3,657,480 BSQ is the sum of the 2,500,000 BSQ which was distributed as symbolic [https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/2f194230e23459a9211322c4b1c182cf3f367086e8059aca2f8f44e20dac527a testnet BSQ] to past contributors back in July 2017 and 1,157,480 BSQ contributors have earned since starting [https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html Phase Zero] in October 2017.

The outputs are the BSQ addresses of all contributors who have contributed to Bisq before we start the DAO on mainnet. All outputs are by definition valid BSQ. The genesis tx is funded with the exact amount, including the miner fee, so there is no change output.

=== Transfer BSQ tx ===

Sending BSQ to another address is a simple transaction without OpReturn. It requires a BSQ input for the transferred BSQ as well as a BTC input to cover the miner fee. The outputs are the receiver&amp;#x27;s BSQ address, an optional BSQ change output, and an optional BTC change output.

A transaction to send 10 BSQ could look like this:

* Input 1: 30.00 BSQ (BSQ sender)
* Input 2: 0.01 BTC (required BTC for mining fee)
* Output 1: 10.00 BSQ (BSQ receiver)
* Output 1: 20.00 BSQ (BSQ change output back to sender)
* Output 2: 0.0095 BTC (BTC change output)
* Mining fee: 0.0005

=== Trade fee tx ===

We invalidate a small amount of BSQ for the trade fee payment. Since the burned amount is used as miner fee and not
as a regular tx output, we are not restricted by the dust limit of 546 satoshis, and can spend fees as little as 0.01 BSQ (equivalent to 1 BTC satoshi). The fee is the difference of the BSQ input and the BSQ output.

A BSQ trade fee payment tx could look like this (for a fee with 0.5 BSQ):

* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 9.50 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.09950050 BTC change output
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049950 BTC + 0.00000050 BTC or 0.50 BSQ)

In this case, we only used 9.50 BSQ of the 10.00 BSQ from the input. Since the second output is spending more than the remaining 0.50 BSQ, it is an invalid BSQ output so we consider it a BTC output. The remaining 0.50 BSQ which was not used in the first output will be used for the mining fee, thus reducing the mining fee which is paid from the BTC input (input 2).

=== Proposal tx ===

A proposal transaction contains an OpReturn output which indicates the type and carries the hash of the
proposal payload data.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x10
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of proposal payload

The hash is created from the bytes of the proposal payload with tx ID set to null using protobuffer serialization.
It is first hashed with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160 to get a 20 byte hash.

Example with a 2 BSQ fee:

* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 8 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.09950200 BTC change output
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Compensation request tx/Reimbursement request tx ===

Compensation request tx and reimbursement request txs are technically the same and inherit the properties of a
proposal tx but have some additional requirements. They add a BTC output which will be interpreted as a BSQ output at the vote result phase in case the request is accepted by voting.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs BSQ issuance and miner fee
* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)
* Outputs [1]: Issuance candidate output; before voted ok it is BTC afterwards newly issued BSQ
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Outputs [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: Compensation request tx: 0x11 / Reimbursement request: 0x12
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of request payload

Example with a 2 BSQ fee and requested issuance amount of 5000 BSQ:

* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 8 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.00500000 BTC (5000 BSQ after positive voting)
* Output 3: 0.09950200 BTC change output
* Output 4: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Blind vote tx ===

The blind vote tx contains the hash of the blind vote payload and uses the vote stake as input. The stake is blocked from spending during this phase and is only unlocked by the vote reveal tx. If another transaction spends the stake, the blind vote becomes invalid. The blind vote requires a fee in BSQ.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee + stake
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output of stake
* Output [0-1] Optional BSQ change output
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x13
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of encrypted votes

To create the encrypted votes we use following data:

* Secret key: 128 bit AES key.
* List of a tuple of proposal Tx IDs + vote, sorted by tx ID. Only valid proposals of current cycle are included.

We use protobuffer serialisation for the bytes which will be encrypted with the secret key.

Example with a 2 BSQ fee and 7000 BSQ vote stake:

* Input 1: 8000.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 7000 BSQ / 0.00700000 BTC
* Output 2: 998 BSQ change output
* Output 3: 0.09950200 BTC change output
* Output 4: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Vote reveal tx ===

The vote reveal tx consumes the stake output from the blind vote tx as the only BSQ input. It does not require a BSQ fee.

In the OpReturn data we add the secret key for decrypting our blind vote and a hash of the blind vote list to ensure consensus of the P2P network data used in voting. This hash will be used in the vote result phase to determine a majority in case different users get a different list of blind votes, which would lead to different vote results, and therefore cause consensus failures.

* Input [1]: BSQ input -&gt; stake output of blind vote tx
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: BSQ output (unlocked stake)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x14
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of blind vote list
* 16 bytes secretKey

The hash of the blind vote list is made using all blind vote payload data received in the cycle and sorted by blind vote tx ID.
The secretKey is the encoded byte representation of the secret key.

Example with 7000 BSQ stake:

* Input 1: 7000 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 7000 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Lockup tx ===

The lock tx can be use for locking up funds for a bonded role or for bonded reputation: a certain amount of BSQ is locked for a defined lock time (in blocks). Only an unlock tx can unlock locked funds. Once the unlock tx is confirmed, the lock time will be used to determine when the funds can be used in a normal transaction again. While funds are locked, they cannot be moved, or they are invalidated. While funds are locked, or are in an unlocking state, funds can be confiscated by voting.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: Locked up BSQ
* Outputs [0-1]: BSQ change output
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x15
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 1 byte for lockup reason (bonded role 0x01, reputation 0x02)
* 2 bytes for lock time (see: bisq.common.util.Utilities.integerToByteArray for encoding)
* 20 bytes for hash

The hash in case of a bonded role is created from immutable data of the bonded role. Currently we use hashCode but that should be changed to a cryptographic hash.
The hash for a reputation is derived from a salt. The salt is by default a random string as hex or can be any string defined by the user.

Example with locking up 4000 BSQ:

* Input 1: 6000 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 4000 BSQ lockup
* Output 1: 2000 BSQ change output
* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Unlock tx ===

The unlock tx takes the lockup tx output and use the lock time encoded in the OpReturn to determine the unlock time.
The BSQ output cannot be used in another tx until the lock time is over. During that time it is in the unlocking state.
Afterwards it is in the unlocked state and can be spent like any normal BSQ output.

* Input [1]: BSQ input from lockup tx lockup output (output index 0)
* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [1]: BSQ unlock output
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee

Example with unlocking 4000 BSQ:

* Input 1: 4000 BSQ (from lockup tx output)
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 4000 BSQ unlocking/unlocked state
* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Asset listing fee tx ===

The asset listing fee tx is used for paying listing fees for an asset. The ticker symbol of the asset is specified in the OpReturn data to bind the tx to a specific asset.
If the BSQ fee is more than the required mining fee, we do not use a BTC input, and add the remaining BTC to the BTC output.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for listing fee
* Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - fee)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x16
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of ticker symbol

We take the bytes of the ticker symbol as UTF-8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.

Example with a BSQ fee of 20 BSQ:

* Input 1: 100.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 80 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.0997 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)

=== Proof of burn tx ===

A user can put the hash of an arbitrary string (pre-image) into a proof of burn tx and burn a specified amount of
BSQ. He can later use the pre-image to prove to any party that he has created that hash. He can also sign any challenge
message and the challenger can verify that he is the key holder of the first input used in that tx.

* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for burned amount
* Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
* Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - burned amount)
* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
* Output [1]: &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; with OpReturnData and amount 0
* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

* 1 byte for tx type: 0x16
* 1 byte for version: 0x01
* 20 bytes for hash of pre image

We take the bytes of the pre-image as UTF-8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.

Example with 20 BSQ burned:

* Input 1: 100.00 BSQ
* Input 2: 0.1 BTC
* Output 1: 80 BSQ
* Output 2: 0.0997 BTC
* Output 3: OpReturn data
* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)

== P2P network payloads ==

Proposals and blind vote data are published over the Bisq P2P network. They must be published in the correct phase and cycle, otherwise they are considered invalid. Each node listens for these messages and persists the data locally. At startup, each node receives missing data from seed nodes. The corresponding tx ID is part of the data and is used to map the data to the transaction. The hash of the P2P network data is part of the OpReturn data in the transactions. In this way, we can verify that the mapping of a tx to the data is correct in both directions.

=== Temporary proposal payload ===

During the proposal phase the user can add and remove proposals. For removing we use the public key which was added when publishing a proposal and verify with a signature if the remove attempt is coming from the same owner. This is the same model as we use in other P2P network data like offer payloads. The data has a time to live of 60 days, and after that, it is removed from local storage.

=== Proposal payload ===

There are several different types of proposals:

* Compensation request
* Reimbursement requests
* Proposal for changing a parameter
* Proposal for a bonded role
* Proposal for confiscating a bond
* Generic proposal
* Proposal for removing an asset

The proposal contains the tx ID of the proposal transaction. When creating the transaction we add the 20-byte hash of
the proposal data to the OpReturn data of the proposal tx. As the tx ID would be part of the proposal data and cannot be
known before the tx is created, we leave it empty and set it afterwards. That way we get a mapping in both directions and
can verify later that a proposal payload has a valid tx and that the tx data matches the proposal data.

During the break after the proposal phase, all nodes publish their proposal payload, which uses proposals from the temporary
proposal payload. This data is now immutable and will be used for voting.

=== Blind vote payload ===

Blind vote data are published when the user makes his blind vote tx and are managed in the same way as proposal payloads (append-only data).

== Governance ==

Governances takes place in regularly-occurring voting cycles. A cycle consists of 4 distinct phases.

=== Phases ===

Phases are defined by block height. Each phase is separated with a break to avoid issues with reorgs.

Here are the phases and the initial duration values (they can be changed by voting):

* Proposal phase (compensation requests, etc): 3600 blocks, about 25 days
* Break: 150 blocks
* Blind vote phase (approve/decline proposals): 450 blocks, about 3 days
* Break: 10 blocks
* Vote reveal phase: 450 blocks, about 3 days
* Break: 10 blocks
* Result phase: 10 blocks

The full cycle will last 4680 blocks which is about one month if one block takes an average of 10 minutes.

==== Proposal phase ====

Any BSQ stakeholder can publish a temporary proposal payload during the proposal phase, as well as remove their own proposals.

==== Blind Vote phase ====

A BSQ stakeholder can vote on any proposal with 3 options: accept, decline or ignore. Not voting on a proposal is the same as ignoring it.

The user defines how much _stake_ they want to put into their vote. The higher the stake, the higher the vote weight compared to other voters. In addition to the stake, _merit_ is added if the user has earned BSQ in previous cycles through accepted compensation requests. The merit value of each issuance ages linearly over time: it reaches 0 after 100 000 blocks (about 2 years). Aged accumulated merit is automatically added to the stake, and the sum of both is the vote weight.

When creating the blind vote tx, the user also publishes the blind vote payload. We use the same linking of tx ID and payload hash to map them together.

==== Vote reveal phase ====

Upon entering the vote reveal phase, each voter automatically publishes their vote reveal tx. There is no fee required for this transaction beside the miner fee. No P2P network data is published.

==== Vote result phase ====

In the vote result phase, all nodes calculate the vote result on all proposals and apply the result to the overall BSQ state.

This process uses the hash of the blind vote list from the vote reveal tx to determine the winning majority, in case users had different P2P network payloads of blind votes. The majority is calculated by stake (not merit) of the voters. Only if at least 80% of the network has the same hash is the cycle is valid, otherwise, all proposals and requests are considered rejected.

A proposal is considered accepted if the required quorum and threshold are reached. Quorum is the minimum amount of accumulated vote weight in BSQ which is required. Threshold is the relationship of accepted votes to total votes. Each proposal type has different quorum and threshold parameters which can be changed by voting, but threshold can never be below 50.01%.

In case a proposal&amp;#x27;s data is not available, it is rejected. In case there are 2 accepted change parameter proposals for changing the same parameter to 2 different values, we reject both as it shows there is a social consensus issue in the DAO.

=== DAO Parameters ===

There are many different parameters which can be changed by voting.
Trading fees, voting parameters (threshold and quorum), durations of the phases, and many more.

See the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/3854907c14357680038661c8153095a157efbc5d/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/governance/param/Param.java Param class] for a complete list.

=== Bonded roles ===

All roles in the Bisq DAO which can potentially create severe damage are handled as bonded roles. To become a role owner one need to make a request for a bonded role, and once accepted by voting, the person needs to lock up the defined bond. The role only is only considered active when the bond is locked up.

The required amount for the bond is defined in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/497e202420940372fa1a344f64d375eac710d299/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/state/model/governance/BondedRoleType.java BondedRoleType enum]. The unlock time is 110 days for all roles.

In severe cases, BSQ stakeholders can make a proposal to confiscate a bond. This will require a very high threshold in voting and is considered an exceptional case which hopefully never happens.

Most bonded roles are connected to environments which cannot interact with the Bisq DAO directly. For example, the Github Admin role cannot be revoked by confiscating the role owner as the Bisq DAO has no power over GitHub. The only exceptions are mediators and arbitrators, since people can be verified as valid bonded role owners before they are used for dispute resolution. This is not implemented yet and will be part of the new trade protocol update in the next few months.

=== Bonded reputation ===

Similar to bonded roles, a user can lock up a bond to prove reputation. There is no concrete use case for this in Bisq at the moment, but we might use it in the future for new forms of trade protocols which are based on bonded reputation.

=== Asset listing fee ===

Assets added to Bisq need to gain enough traders to reach a minimum trade volume over a certain time period. These parameters are DAO parameters and can be changed by voting. If an asset does not satisfy these parameters, such as trading volume thresholds, it will be removed from the list of assets when creating an altcoin payment account or selecting the preferred currencies in the software preferences.

Anyone can pay a fee in BSQ to gain access to a trial period where requirements to reach trade volume thresholds are lifted. Usually the coin issuers do this, but it can be done by anyone interested in trading a particular asset. The fee is initially 1 BSQ per day for a trial period, with a minimum of 30 days. The fee can be changed by voting.

If an asset gets removed by a &lt;code&gt;Remove Asset Proposal&lt;/code&gt;, it can no longer be reactivated by the listing fee. Listing fees already paid are lost in this case.

=== Proof of burn ===

This advanced feature does not have a concrete use at the moment, but might be used in the future. Burning BSQ can be used as a form of reputation. If one is willing to burn some money, and can use that proof for other activities (e.g. securing a trade), they might be interested that this form of reputation by burning BSQ will not become pointless in case he was publicly proven as scammer. The user can prove that he was the originator of the transaction by providing the pre-image to a hash, which gets added to the OpReturn data and he can sign any challenge message to prove he had funded the transaction. We use the EC key from the first input for the signature.

== Disclaimer ==

This document does not cover all details and cannot be used as basis for implementation of BSQ features or for
creating self-crafted transactions. The source code is the only real specification. It is NOT recommended to create custom BSQ transactions, as tiny mistakes can lead to destroyed BSQ. Bisq developers will not be concerned with transactions which might be valid with the current rule set but which have not been created by the Bisq application. In the future, updated rules might become more strict and might break such externally-created transactions. Requirements for backward compatibility will only consider use cases and tx structures created by the Bisq application.

Please note that currently it is not recommended to send BSQ to a hardware wallet. Handling the miner fee might cause invalidation of the BSQ funds or cause losses if precious BSQ is used to pay the miner fee. We will publish some instructions how to do this in a safe way soon.</text></revision></page><page><title>Buy BSQ</title><ns>0</ns><id>446</id><revision><id>2097</id><timestamp>2021-04-06T20:18:43Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Updating BSQ fees&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; takes place every cycle to keep the BSQ [[trading fees]] at a 50% discount to BTC trading fees.

The [[Compensation Maintainer]] takes the following steps to update BSQ trading fees.

__TOC__

== Determine new BSQ fees ==

Three days before the end of proposal phase, the [[Compensation Maintainer]] shall:

* Calculate BSQ trading fee discount [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-hISy7F0NSqPnRxDOoi1k7df1qLJHfQTxhrVLt6NbX4/edit#gid=0 on this spreadsheet] using the 30-day weighted average USD/BSQ price and live USD/BTC price at the time.
** If existing BSQ discount is under 40% or over 60%, calculate new BSQ trading fees to restore a 50% discount. 
** Update spreadsheet with new proposed fees. If there is no need for an update, leave the &amp;quot;New Fees&amp;quot; section blank.

== Submit DAO parameter proposals ==

Upon calculating the new BSQ fees, the [[Compensation Maintainer]] shall:

* Create a new post on [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/ github proposals] with the title &lt;code&gt;BSQ trading fee update for Cycle X&lt;/code&gt; indicating the new proposed trading fees and close the old post (or indicate in a comment at the already opened post if there will be no changes).
* Submit DAO change parameter proposals for new BSQ trading fees and comment the corresponding TXIDs (if necessary).

== Communicate changes ==

Once DAO results are available, the [[Compensation Maintainer]] shall:

* Update the [[trading fees]] page with new BSQ trading fees.

== Reference ==

Proposals [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/173 #173] and [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/365 #365] led to the development of this procedure.

The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Compensation Maintainer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; handles announcements and issue triaging for compensation requests.

__TOC__

== Issue ==

== Team ==
[https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/compensation-maintainers @bisq-network/compensation-maintainers]

== Duties ==

=== Announce BSQ-USD exchange rate ===

Compensation requests use a [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/313 30-day volume-weighted average] to determine a BSQ/USD rate that discounts outliers. 
At the beginning of the cycle, the Compensation Maintainer should create a pinned issue with the title &amp;quot;BSQ rate for Cycle X is Y.YY USD per 1 BSQ&amp;quot;.
&lt;!-- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/782 --&gt;

=== Announce request submission deadline ===

To allow time for team leads to discuss and review compensation requests, requests need to be ready for review 1 week before the end of current cycle&amp;#x27;s proposal phase. 

[[File:Compensation_board.png|400px|right|thumb|Compensation board]]

Dates and reminders will be announced on a pinned issue at github [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues compensation repository], the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/projects/20/ compensation board], and the [[events calendar]].

=== Triage incoming requests ===

The Compensation Maintainer watches the [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues compensation repository] and proceeds to triage:

Incoming issues are categorized as &lt;code&gt;In Progress&lt;/code&gt; if they have &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of the title or as &lt;code&gt;In Review&lt;/code&gt; if they don&amp;#x27;t. The Compensation Maintainer assigns &lt;code&gt;In Review&lt;/code&gt; issues to the appropriate team leads (or determine which team leads are responsible if it isn&amp;#x27;t obvious).

As requests are submitted to the DAO (with txid posted in corresponding issues), the Compensation Maintainer should classify requests as &lt;code&gt;Proposal Submitted&lt;/code&gt;.

This triage can be controlled from the Compensation board by:
* using the &amp;quot;Add cards&amp;quot; button on the board to triage new issues
* dragging and dropping existing issues to categories
* using the &amp;quot;Projects&amp;quot; section in the right sidebar of an issue&amp;#x27;s page

=== Archive previous cycle requests at the end of the proposal phase ===

Once a cycle&amp;#x27;s proposal phase is over, the Compensation Maintainer should [https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/archiving-cards-on-a-project-board archive] all issues in the &lt;code&gt;Done&lt;/code&gt; column from the previous phase.

The reason for waiting to archive these issues is so that contributors can easily see how many requests were made in the last cycle, quickly find their own request, and easily review which ones were accepted and rejected. Requests are archived in order to keep the board clean and make room for requests in the next cycle.

=== Close current cycle requests after the vote reveal phase ===

When the reveal vote phase is complete, the Compensation Maintainer should take the following steps:

# Label each compensation request issue as &lt;code&gt;was:accepted&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;was:rejected&lt;/code&gt; according to the vote result
# Close the issue with a comment indicating the request&amp;#x27;s outcome (e.g., &amp;quot;Closing as accepted&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Closing as rejected&amp;quot;)

Once closed, the issues will automatically move to the &lt;code&gt;Done&lt;/code&gt; column of the board, where they remain for reference until they are archived at the end of the next cycle&amp;#x27;s proposal phase (see above).

This article is a stub pending the adaptation of the current [[Mediator#Duties]] section here.


[[Mediation]] is a tool used to resolve a dispute between traders. It opens automatically after the trade period is over and the trade has not been completed. It can also be opened manually beforehand if needed by either one of the traders. Before opening a support ticket, traders should remember that they can contact the other party directly by using the Chat provided when the trade opens.


== Trader&amp;#x27;s Instructions ==
* Respond to the Mediator on the support ticket explaining why the ticket was opened. 48 hr response limit.
* Provide proof of payment via a screenshot or PDF if required by the [[Mediator]].
* In case of banking issues, keep detailed information of what happened (i.e. when was your account closed) attaching screenshots.

== Mediator&amp;#x27;s Duties ==
* Contact both parties of the trade (BTC buyer and BTC seller) to find out what the problem is and why the Support ticket was opened.
* Check: Maker Fee Transaction ID, Taker Fee Transaction ID and Deposit Transaction ID to make sure the transaction was published and funds are not stuck.
* If needed, the Mediator will require the private keys from both traders to carry out a manual payout.
* In case of disagreement or unclear information, verified proof of payment may be required to either party by the Mediator.
* Be available on Matrix to help users that may not be able to reach out through the Bisq app.
* Respond within 24 hours.
* When bugs occur, create detailed issues on [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq Github] using the correct repository and notify L2 Support.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Arbitration&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; refers to the last stage of the dispute resolution process—it&amp;#x27;s what takes place in case trader chat and [[Mediation|mediation]] fail to resolve a dispute. 

This page first covers the arbitration process itself, in a practical sense, so that users can be made aware of what to expect when trading. Then it covers the process in more detail, including its motivations, how all the components work together, and how the process is expected to develop in the future.

{{Admonition_Warn|All trades placed from 1st January 2023 will use a new trade protocol ([[Burning Men|Burning Men Protocol]]) that is designed to further improve the decentralization of Bisq. The new protocol is a result of the proposal [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 Distribute Burningman role to contributors who burned BSQ] which was vote on in Bisq DAO cycle 41 with 100% approval.

The protocol change means trades placed from 1st January 2023 will have an important difference should the trade end in arbitration. This is as a result of the accepted proposal [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/386 do not pay out the security deposit of the trade peer to the arbitration case winner].

What this means in practice is IF a trade ends in arbitration the arbitrator will only payout the trade amount plus one users security deposit. Previously they paid out the trade amount plus both user&amp;#x27;s security deposits. Therefore, traders ending in arbitration will notice the following:

* The arbitration &amp;#x27;winner&amp;#x27; will not be compensated for the inconvenience caused by the trade going to arbitration.
* The arbitration &amp;#x27;loser&amp;#x27; will not be be refunded their deposit partially or in full.

This chance is necessary for the security of the new protocol. 

Remember arbitration should be seen as the last resort. All efforts should be made for trader to come to an agreement with themselves or via the mediator.}}


== Process ==

Bisq&amp;#x27;s arbitration process is a thoroughly decentralized approach to handling disputes between 2 strangers on the internet: one in which no user needs to trust a third party with authority over their funds, but one in which a user can still expect a satisfactory outcome if they have followed the Bisq [[trading rules]].

Arbitration is only available when:

* one or both traders reject a [[Mediation|mediator’s]] suggested payout
* the time-locked delayed payout transaction is published

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;time-locked delayed payout transaction&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is signed (but not published) at the beginning of the trade process. Its purpose is to allow time for traders and mediators to work out a payout using the funds in the 2-of-2 multisig escrow, and to eliminate the [[#Avoiding_Fraud|possibility of fraud]] in case they can&amp;#x27;t.

Requesting arbitration publishes this time-locked transaction, sending all funds in the multisig escrow (i.e., those of both trading peers) to the Bisq &amp;quot;donation addresses&amp;quot; (which are owned by the [[Burning Men]], Bisq contributors who burn BSQ in advance). This transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for altcoin trades) and 20 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for fiat trades), which means arbitration is only available after this time has passed.

[[Burning Men]] burn BSQ after estimating how many BTC from trading fees and delayed payouts will be during a cycle, and a filter controlled by the DAO distributes the BTC in proportion to how many BSQ have been burned. This keeps BSQ supply balanced, allowing for a corresponding amount of new BSQ to be issued to account for the BTC payouts made to traders as part of arbitration. As a result, BSQ supply is largely unaffected.

This dynamic essentially enables a sort of mutually assured destruction to drive dispute resolution on Bisq without trusted third parties.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;In plain language, here&amp;#x27;s how the process works for traders:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# If you’re dissatisfied with the mediator’s suggestion and think you are entitled to a better outcome, request arbitration when it&amp;#x27;s available (doing so publishes the time-locked transaction and sends funds to the donation addresses owned by the Burning Men).
# Collaborate with an arbitrator to clarify the details of your case.
# If the arbitrator agrees you are owed BTC, they will pay it to you.
# The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO so they are not out of pocket.

Takeaway: if you are owed BTC after a dispute, you&amp;#x27;ll get it from an arbitrator who will refund you with their own funds. The arbitrator then requests reimbursement from the Bisq DAO usually once per DAO cycle and asks for the BSQ amount as a reimbursement for the BTC they have refunded Bisq traders. .

== Process, In Detail ==

To better understand arbitration, we need to first understand the new trade protocol, and how it improves upon the old trade protocol.

=== Pre v1.2 Trade Protocol ===

The previous model with 2-of-3 multisig deposit transactions (where an arbitrator was the 3rd key holder, and makes the payout to one of the traders in dispute cases) carried a significant risk: if the arbitrator was malicious (or was hacked), he could have taken all offers with a sockpuppet trader and made the payouts right back to his own sockpuppet. 

This risk made it impossible to scale dispute resolution and find more arbitrators—we were limited to filling the role with a tiny number of Bisq contributors who could be 100% trusted to not be malicious and who had a good enough background in computer security to make getting hacked highly unlikely. 

This element was the single most problematic element in Bisq’s old trade protocol, but since there weren’t any better solutions, we used it for as long as we had to.

=== Post 1.2 Trade Protocol ===

The new trade protocol, launched in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.0 Bisq v1.2], eliminates the risks described above to a large extent by separating functions and involving the DAO. It significantly improves censorship-resistance, security, and scalability of dispute resolution on Bisq.

[[File:Ntp-v12.png|thumb|right|Dispute resolution for trade protocol (v1.2+).]]

The basic change is that it uses a 2-of-2 multisig in the deposit transaction with only the traders’ keys. 

On the happy path, the traders each sign the payout tx once the fiat or altcoin is transferred. 

If anything goes wrong, there are 3 stages to resolve the issue:

# The traders can have a direct chat where they can try to find a solution to their problem.
# If that does not succeed either trader can open a mediation ticket and request help from a mediator. Mediators play a role similar to that of arbitrators in the old model, except they don’t have a 3rd key. They only can make a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;suggestion&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; for the payout distribution, which either trader is free to accept or reject. If both traders accept, they create and sign the payout tx and the trade is completed. If either trader rejects, the dispute goes to stage 3. This escalation can only take place after a certain time period has passed. For altcoins, this period is 10 days, and for fiat it’s 20 days.
# An arbitrator will investigate the case, just like a mediator would, and decide how a payout should be distributed. The arbitrator role currently has 2 parts: supreme mediator and refund agent (this is where the term &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;refund agent&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; comes from, but &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;arbitrator&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a better term for the role, as we will soon see). The supreme mediator part of the role is similar in function to that of a regular mediator (i.e., investigate a dispute). The refund agent reimburses traders BTC for disputed trades without requiring them to undergo the complex and time-consuming process of making a reimbursement request in the DAO. The ultimate goal, however, is to make such extreme dispute cases so &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;rare&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that requiring users to request reimbursement from the DAO on their own becomes feasible (e.g., by reducing bugs, UX improvements, increasing security deposits, etc). But we’re not there yet, so for now, an arbitrator simply decides on a payout &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; funds this payout from their own pocket, and later makes a reimbursement request to the DAO to be reimbursed for their reimbursement to the user. To avoid [[#Avoiding_Fraud|potential fraud]], and to keep the DAO from losing money in each arbitration case, we use the [[#Donation_Address|donation address]] to receive the funds from the trade via the time-locked delayed payout payout tx.

=== Time-Locked Delayed Payout Payout Transaction ===
Since [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.8 v1.9.8], traders create a time-locked delayed payout payout tx where all the locked up funds (trade amount + both [[security deposit|security deposits]]) are sent to Bisq donation address owners, also known as burningmen. These addresses are defined in the DAO. The burningmen are Bisq contributors who burn their BSQ in order to get a portion of time-locked delayed payouts and trading fees paid in BTC.
From v1.2 to v1.9.8, this address was controlled by a single burning man who exchanged BTC for BSQ to burn them afterwards. That supposed a risk for the DAO as, although the burningman had to place a BSQ bond, the amount of the bond was lower than the amount of expected BTC to collect. Distributing the role into multiple burningman and requiring them to burn BSQ in advance, this risk has significantly decreased.  

If a trade is not completed in 10 days (for altcoins) or 20 days (for fiat), either of the 2 traders have a chance (after mediation) to publish the time-locked payout tx where all deposit funds are sent to the donation address, requiring the aggrieved trader to request arbitration so they can receive a payout. With the preliminary solution we use now, the trader gets a payout from an arbitrator directly, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;but the eventual goal is that the arbitrator makes a suggestion which the DAO uses as a basis for voting on the reimbursement request made by the trader(s)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

=== Avoiding Fraud ===

The time-locked delayed payout payout tx is essential to avoid fraud. A trader could make a self-trade and then claim that his “peer” has not paid. Without the time-locked payout tx, he could go through the dispute process, make a reimbursement request, and receive BSQ for the equivalent “lost” funds in BTC. After that he could make the payout to himself from the trade, since he controls both “traders”—thereby scamming the DAO with the trade amount. 

To avoid this fraud, we require that locked up funds in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx are spent before opening an arbitration ticket. Thus it is not possible for a trader to defraud the DAO in the way described above.

=== Donation Address Owners (burningmen) ===

Burningmen are current and past contributors who earned BSQ by contributing to Bisq who opt to to burn their BSQ to get BTC from time-locked delayed payout transactions and trading fees paid in BTC. A DAO filter distributes the BTC in proportion to their relative amount of BSQ burned. The amount of BSQ to be burned is limited  for each contributor, to prevent that a single burningman could create self trades and take advantage from being refunded at arbitration and receiving BTC from the DAO filter as well. In order to keep this system safe, it is required that refund agent does not reimburse a security deposit from deposit transaction.
The amount of BSQ to be burned (burn target) is estimated from accumulated reimbursement requests, trade fees paid in BTC and burned BSQ from burningmen in the last 12 months.
The BSQ burned and BTC sent to burningmen should balance over time. Each one of the burningmen, according to their prefferences, could try to &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; a discount rate for the risk assumed advancing their BSQ to the DAO by burning less than the burning target, or they could try to &amp;quot;pay&amp;quot; to avoid  selling big volumes of BSQ to a low liquid market by overburning (up to 100.000 BSQ over the burning target). They could also under or overestimate the amount of BTC to be received over the next year, which is the period that burned amounts decay linearly: the burn target is an estimation with data from the past.
DAO contributors have another way to turn BSQ into BTC while contributing to remove the legacy burningman, which was a central point of failure for the Bisq DAO and created distorsion as a big BSQ buyer. Some burningmen will require to buy BSQ to be burned eventually. The impact for the market will be reduced as there will be multiple interested parties. 


Let’s make a simple example to clarify:

* Two traders are engaged in a 1 BTC trade, with 0.15 BTC each locked in a security deposit
* 1.3 BTC is locked in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx (ignoring miner fees)
* Assume BSQ/BTC is trading at 0.0001 (for easy calculations)

After the required time passes, and the mediation process is closed, one of the traders opens an arbitration case. By doing so, the 1.3 BTC is sent to donation addresses (controlled by the burning men). This transaction was signed by both traders at the time the offer was taken, but was time-locked so it was invalid until the required time had passed. The arbitrator investigates the case and makes a 1.15 BTC payout to the winning trader. He pays this sum from his personal wallet (pre-financing).

We assume that burningmen know there will be only one delayed payout during a cycle: burningmen burned 12,000 BSQ and received the 1.3 BTC into different addresses (which generates a 0.1 BTC profit), each one receiving a % based on the amount they&amp;#x27;ve burned. 
The arbitrator then makes a reimbursement request of 11,500 BSQ to settle his pre-financing. When approved, the DAO issues 11,500 BSQ to the arbitrator. The 0.1 BTC profit for burningmen was subsidized with the 0.15 BTC from the unpaid security deposit. The DAO keeps the other 0.5 BTC in form of reduction in BSQ supply of 0.05 BTC.
Arbitrator will have to burn or sell the BSQ the reimbursed BSQ to get BTC for new payments and reduce volatility risk, which is taking a high risk as they pre-finance the reimbursement. Bisq tries to make arbitration rare as reimbursing traders has a big cost.

=== Why We Cannot Merge the Arbitrator and Burning Man Roles ===

The separation of these roles is essential to keep the system flexible, censorship-resistant, and scalable. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Keep in mind that the current dual role of arbitrators (i.e., supreme mediator and refund agent) is not the ultimate goal&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The refund agent part of the role should be delegated to traders once the trade process is improved to a level where such cases rarely happen. How to keep the burden for traders low, and how to compensate them for this extra work—these items are still up for discussion (e.g. the trader could get a slight bonus if he does the reimbursement himself). A preferred option is to keep trader-submitted reimbursement requests optional and still offer arbitrator-funded reimbursements for a fee. The role could even be split, such that a market of refund agents develops where each agent offers their pre-financing services at different prices. But before getting into any of these discussions, we need to reduce bugs and improve UX.

The role of the burning man has been distributed between different contributors and  a part of their earnings come directly as BTC, but it could also disappear when we have very few dispute cases, and once trade fees in BTC do not add up to a large amount. We could use the donation address to support critical infrastructure we use like Tor. Or we could use it to fund Bisq projects like the mobile wallet.  There are many possibilities for how we could use these funds—but if we merged the burning man role with the arbitrator role, we would lose this flexibility.

The risks of the 2 roles are very different. An arbitrator does not present any severe risk to the DAO, actually, he &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;takes on&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; a lot of risk. A single burning man, on the other hand, is a trusted role and there is an open problem that a malicious burning man could make many trades, go to the arbitrator, get payouts, and then run away with the funds he received from the donation address. The high bond is a partial protection, but ultimately, this is a trusted role and only highly trusted Bisq contributors can take it on. This problem has been mitigated by distributing the role between different contributors with a cap on how much BTC they can get. So scalability is a small issue with the distributed burningmen, but we cannot say the same about the arbitrator. With more traders, there will be more cases, and we might need more arbitrators. Furthermore, with more regional expansion, we will need arbitrators with particular language skills. When arbitrators and burningmen are not combined into one role, we can add arbitrators to support this growth without posing high risk to the Bisq network. If we merged both roles, we would not be able to do this. There is a risk arbitrators expose to the DAO: they could fake their reporting, but this is likely solvable (traders can provide evidence).

Another important aspect is that arbitrator reimbursement is not automated. DAO stakeholders have ultimate power. Sure, they would probably lose an arbitrator if they don’t reimburse him fairly, and it might be hard to find new arbitrators after unfair behaviour from DAO stakeholders. But it is highly important that stakeholders be able to exercise absolute power.

Another consideration: if the process to reimburse arbitrators were automated, the result would probably involve legal risks that we want to avoid. The role would then adopt elements of a custodial function, and that would likely trigger regulatory issues.

=== FAQ ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;What are the conditions that lead to a payout, for example, a dispute between Bob and Alice that is not resolved by normal mediation and gets escalated to arbitration?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

After the time-lock period (10 days for altcoins and 20 days for fiat), and after mediation is completed, either trader can open an arbitration ticket. Doing so publishes the time-locked delayed payout transaction.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How are Bob and Alice&amp;#x27;s BTC funds paid out to the Bisq donation addresses?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

The time-locked payout transaction is created and signed in the take-offer process and stored by both traders. The trade protocol requires this transaction to be in place before a trade is started.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How is the arbitrator responsible for deciding what the payout distribution should be? Are facts and circumstances of the case taken into account? And how is this similar to legacy arbitration?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In terms of determining what a payout should be, an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s role is the same as that of a mediator. They&amp;#x27;ll ask you for any additional information they need to determine the facts and circumstances of the case. The only practical difference between arbitration and legacy arbitration is that arbitrators use their own funds to pay trader(s) instead of funds from the trading escrow.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How, upon deciding a payout, does an arbitrator pay the BTC to Bob and Alice?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Arbitrators need to have enough BTC to cover potential payouts (up to 0.5 BTC per trade) — it&amp;#x27;s a requirement for anyone seeking to hold the role. An arbitration case can only be closed once an arbitrator makes a payout. Then, at the end of the DAO cycle, they&amp;#x27;ll get reimbursed with BSQ (which they can then sell for BTC).

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Are there any trades the arbitrator will not pay out? &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Arbitrators will only reimburse trades in which the multisig deposit has been sent to the Bisq donation addresses. For trades requiring large reimbursements (above 0.5 BTC) they should be aware the arbitrators will only [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/296 partially reimburse traders up to 0.5 BTC]. Should a trader require a reimbursement over 0.5 BTC they can make a reimbursement request directly to the DAO on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support support repository]. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does the arbitrator issue a reimbursement request for an amount of BSQ equivalent to the amount of BTC paid out-of-pocket to settle disputes?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

This process is a work in progress. Currently we try to reduce volatility and exposure risk by converting pre-financed BTC to BSQ as fast as possible. Once it is BSQ there is no longer any volatility risk, and the arbitrator simply sums up all pre-financed BSQ and requests reimbursement. The public result of an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s work is a reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does the DAO issue this BSQ to reimburse arbitrators?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

A reimbursement request is technically the same as a compensation request. DAO stakeholders vote on an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s request. The arbitrator needs to provide solid reporting to make their request transparent to the DAO. Currently there is some trust involved, since it cannot be proven that the arbitrator is not adding fake cases. This may be solvable by collecting data from traders, but this requires more thought.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Doesn&amp;#x27;t this dispute resolution mechanism incentivize Bisq to have more trades go to arbitration, since disputed BTC funds are sent to the burningmen, and thereby benefit BSQ holders and themselves?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

It&amp;#x27;s the traders who open arbitration, the DAO can&amp;#x27;t start arbitration, although it could generate bugs and be unresponsive at mediation. In this case, traders will be fully reimbursed (which will generate a loss for the DAO, as arbitrator charges for every arbitration case) if they have done enough reporting the issue and trying to get [[User_support|support]] through Matrix or Github. 
Bugs and requiring arbitration is a bad user experience, so the DAO is also incentivized to keep arbitration and mediation cases at the minimum.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does an arbitrator spends their newly-issued BSQ?

The arbitrator sells BSQ for BTC from the market and burns BSQ as soon as reimbursement request is paid.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does the burningman burn the BSQ they earn or buy?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Burning is done inside the Bisq software on &lt;code&gt;DAO / Burning / Burningmen&lt;/code&gt;.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Why not simply combine the burning man and arbitrator roles?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

[[#Why_We_Cannot_Merge_These_Roles|See longer explanation above]]. In short: to stay flexible, to be able to implement the target vision (reimbursement done by traders themselves), to avoid legal risks, to keep the arbitrator role scalable, and to address the trust/security issue with the current burning man model.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 1 content --&gt;

An &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;arbitrator&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; resolves disputes that could not be resolved by traders on their own or with a [[Mediator|mediator]]&amp;#x27;s help. 

Arbitrators investigate disputes, just like mediators. But unlike mediators, whose suggestions encourage traders to make payouts from their own escrowed funds, an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s findings lead to a payout from the arbitrator themselves. 

__TOC__

{{Admonition_Warn|All trades placed from 1st January 2023 will use a new trade protocol that is designed to further improve the decentralization of Bisq. The new protocol is a result of the proposal [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 Distribute Burningman role to contributors who burned BSQ] which was vote on in Bisq DAO cycle 41 with 100% approval.

The protocol change means trades placed from 1st January 2023 will have an important difference should the trade end in arbitration. This is as a result of the accepted proposal [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/386 do not pay out the security deposit of the trade peer to the arbitration case winner].

What this means in practice is IF a trade ends in arbitration the arbitrator will only payout the trade amount plus one users security deposit. Previously they paid out the trade amount plus both user&amp;#x27;s security deposits. Therefore, traders ending in arbitration will notice the following:

* The arbitration &amp;#x27;winner&amp;#x27; will not be compensated for the inconvenience caused by the trade going to arbitration.
* The arbitration &amp;#x27;loser&amp;#x27; will not be be refunded their deposit partially or in full.

This chance is necessary for the security of the new protocol. 

Remember arbitration should be seen as the last resort. All efforts should be made for trader to come to an agreement with themselves or via the mediator.}}

== Role Notes ==

=== Arbitrator&amp;#x27;s Role in Dispute Resolution ===

Currently, the arbitrator makes BTC payouts to aggrieved traders out of their own pocket and gets refunded by the Bisq DAO (hence the term &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;refund agent&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; used sometimes). But this arrangement is intended as a convenience so that traders can avoid making a reimbursement request to the DAO on their own. 

The arbitrator role is one element of Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralized dispute resolution process. Please see more details at [[Arbitration|arbitration]].

=== Arbitrator versus Legacy Arbitrator ===

Although arbitrators have been a component of dispute resolution on Bisq since its early days, the v1.2 update wholly changed the nature of the role.

Before the update, trade funds were secured in a 2-of-3 multisig escrow, in which arbitrators held the third key. They would evaluate disputes and then sign funds to traders as they saw fit. Since these arbitrators (which we now refer to as &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;legacy arbitrators&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;) had some element of control over users&amp;#x27; funds, those who filled the role had to be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;very&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; highly trusted.

The v1.2 update enabled trade funds to be secured in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow, in which arbitrators have &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;no involvement&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Mediators handle most disputes, but if an arbitrator does get involved, payouts either come from the arbitrator&amp;#x27;s own pocket or from the Bisq DAO. Arbitrators are still trusted to conduct their role with integrity and consistency, but this is a wholly different kind of trust, one that is unrelated to the handling of users&amp;#x27; funds, and thus one that doesn&amp;#x27;t even require a bond.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

== Penalties ==  
Bisq has [[Trading_rules|Rules]] in place to make the trading process as safe and convenient as possible for all parties involved, and it is important those rules are followed by users.

Penalties are a percentage of the trade amount, deducted from the offending peer&amp;#x27;s security deposit (and when needed, also from trade amount itself) and offered as a compensation to the other peer during the [[Dispute_resolution#Level_2:_Mediation|Dispute resolution process]]
The actual penalty will be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;up to&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the values detailed below, depending on security deposit % and mediator&amp;#x27;s discretion.

100% penalties are for serious violations and will always imply losing the whole amount (trade + deposit).

If two or more penalties are caused by the buyer or seller the penalty amount will be greater of the amounts. Penalties are not cumulative.

Ideally, if good communication is established, peers can use trader chat to agree on a penalty amount to relay to their mediator.

Regardless of any penalty amount proposed the mediation proposal will always leave a peer with at least 5% of trade amount. This is to incentivize the peer to accept the mediation proposal rather than take the trade to arbitration where they will likely lose all of their deposit.

&lt;!--
- Release times can&amp;#x27;t be enforced, because at mediation, the last trader to accept the suggestion is the one who decides when the payout is submitted.
- Cannot accept SEPA instant is replaced by buyer or seller&amp;#x27;s penalty &amp;quot;Suggest different payment method - account without mediator&amp;#x27;s acknowledgement.&amp;quot;. This way, an instant SEPA trade could continue as normal SEPA
- All reasons to  cancel a trade are merged, because traders will tend to give the reason that penalizes them less
- I keep the explanation because penalizing a user because their bank asks for info is a controversial matter. I might agree with note 3 but this has been working so far.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Both Bisq traders must follow these &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;trading rules&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to ensure smooth and successful trades.

To trade on Bisq, you assume one of two roles, no matter what national currency or cryptocurrency you’re trading: you either &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buy bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;sell bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

The rules below are &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;default&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; rules for every transaction. Offer makers sometimes specify their own additional terms for handling payments. For example, a seller using cash deposits might require a picture of a receipt torn in half with &amp;quot;NO REFUND&amp;quot; written on it. Face-to-face traders often specify terms about where and how to meet. 

Make sure you’re okay with an offer-maker’s terms &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;before&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; you accept an offer!

Trade rules also help with the following:

* Promoting good behavior from traders
* Penalizing bad behavior from traders
* Promoting good payment accounts of traders
* Penalizing bad payment accounts of traders
* Put the &amp;#x27;wrong doer&amp;#x27; in a worse position and the person &amp;#x27;not at fault&amp;#x27; in a better position

= Common rules =

=== No requirement to reply in trader chat ===

While using the available trade chat can be helpful to resolve issues directly among traders without the overhead of mediation, and being communicative is a good way to ease the process for new traders, there is no obligation to reply to a peer&amp;#x27;s messages.

=== Do not communicate with your peer away from Bisq ===

Using email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is strongly discouraged. The trader chat feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader’s chat messages indicate they broke a rule). This includes advertising offers to sell BTC with a way to contact you, for example a website, Telegram user name, or email.

In any case, it is forbidden to contact the peer using contacts obtained from their payment details, without their prior consent, or missing a compelling reason to do so.

=== Be responsive during a dispute ===

Traders are expected to reply within 48hrs to either mediators or arbitrators, and could lose the dispute based on unresponsiveness.

Mediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.

=== Do not change payment details once trade is in progress ===

Once the deposit transaction is published, the trade is in progress, and its terms cannot be changed. Traders agreed to use the payment details specified in the trade contract.

In the event of an unexpected circumstance (e.g. hitting a bank-imposed transfer limit, or a payment institution interfering with the transaction), traders can propose alternatives through trader chat or mediation, but the peer is not required to comply. It is each trader&amp;#x27;s responsibility to ensure that the payment account in their offer will work before an offer is taken.

= Rules for bitcoin sellers =

Whether making or taking an offer, bitcoin sellers put all the bitcoin they’re selling in the multisig escrow, so there’s less for them to do and fewer rules they need to follow.

=== Click &lt;code&gt;Confirm payment&lt;/code&gt; after receiving payment ===

Sellers have until the end of the maximum trade period to do so.

[[Account_limits#Account_signing|Account signing]], introduced in Bisq v1.2, enables a seller with a signed payment account to sign a buyer’s payment account when they successfully receive a payment. For such trades, it is recommended that the seller take as long as possible (i.e., wait until close to the end of the trade period) to confirm receipt of payment to reduce the chance of a chargeback.

=== Do not confirm payments with mismatching details ===

Payer name, account numbers, payment method, institution, and other details of a payment should match the details in the trade contract. If there are any concerns that buyer&amp;#x27;s payment details do not match (e.g. wrong name, account number etc) payment should not be accepted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

{{Admonition_Warn|This is especially relevant for trades in which a signed seller trades with an unsigned buyer, because confirmation of payment receipt signs the buyer’s payment account. In case of such an issue, a dispute should be opened.}}

= Rules for bitcoin buyers =

{{Admonition_Warn|To avoid unexpected issues, make sure you can actually carry out a payment with the payment method you’ve set up in Bisq. Examples: Wells Fargo doesn’t allow cash deposits into bank accounts not owned by the depositor, and Zelle has weekly and monthly transfer maximums that are easy to overlook. The software will warn you about known issues, but cannot possibly keep up with all the newest banking and money transfer rules.}}

=== Make payment reasonably early within trade period ===

Buyer should complete at a time such that the seller has enough time to acknowledge receipt of the payment before the trade period is over. Waiting until the very end of the trade period to make a payment is not advised, as then the seller cannot reasonably act in time to acknowledge receipt (also, it’s annoying). The lengths of trade periods vary based on [[Payment methods|payment method]].

This is especially important for buyers with unsigned payment accounts trading with sellers with signed payment accounts. A seller will not want to confirm receipt of a payment made at the last minute from an untrusted account, so if you’re a buyer looking to get your payment account signed, you should make the payment &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;as soon as possible&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Some payment methods include an option to cancel a payment after you have sent it eg Revolut and Interac e-Transfer. If you cancel payment without agreement with the seller or mediator you might end up being penalized for cancelling the trade.

=== Click Payment started after sending payment ===

Seller cannot mark payment as received until buyer confirms that they have sent it. 

Don’t forget to do this!

=== Leave the &amp;quot;reason for payment&amp;quot; field empty ===

{{Admonition_Warn|Before 1.5.5, it was required to put the trade ID in the &amp;#x27;reason for payment&amp;#x27; field of a payment. As of 1.5.5, reason for payment should be left BLANK.}}

Some payments offer a way to specify a reason for payment (some payment methods call it &amp;quot;Message&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Information for recipient&amp;quot; or similar). &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Leave this field BLANK.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Do not put the trade ID, any mentions of &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Bitcoin&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;crypto&amp;quot;, or any other text whatsoever.

If you are required to fill in a reason, use your account name eg &amp;quot;Joe Bloggs&amp;quot; alternatively enter something non-descriptive like a dash &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;. If you would prefer to use other text please agree this with your peer in trader chat. Please remember your peer is not obligated to agree anything and may not want to agree to anything other than leaving the description blank, your name or a dash. 

Violating this rule will likely result in a [[Table of penalties|trade penalty]]. 

Many banks don’t like anything related to Bitcoin, and may take draconian measures if they sense such a transaction.

Many users trade from personal accounts and may object to using anything that looks like it could be a commercial transaction.

=== Pay any transaction fees ===

Any fees incurred to make the payment via the agreed payment method (e.g., bank fees for bank transfer, money-order fees for money orders, etc) are the buyer’s responsibility to pay.

The seller should receive the exact amount of the trade. The only exception to this rule is if the receiving institution imposes a fee on incoming payments—these fees are borne by the seller.

= What happens when things go wrong? =

Sometimes trades do not go to plan for whatever reason. 

It is prudent for all traders to know when entering into the trade what will happen when things go wrong. Traders would be wise to make themselves aware of the [[dispute resolution]] process to ensure there are no surprises.</text></revision></page><page><title>Table of penalties</title><ns>0</ns><id>445</id><revision><id>3794</id><timestamp>2024-11-27T07:56:12Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

== Penalties ==  
Bisq has [[Trading_rules|Rules]] in place to make the trading process as safe and convenient as possible for all parties involved, and it is important those rules are followed by users.

Penalties are a percentage of the trade amount, deducted from the offending peer&amp;#x27;s security deposit (and when needed, also from trade amount itself) and offered as a compensation to the other peer during the [[Dispute_resolution#Level_2:_Mediation|Dispute resolution process]]
The actual penalty will be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;up to&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the values detailed below, depending on security deposit % and mediator&amp;#x27;s discretion.

100% penalties are for serious violations and will always imply losing the whole amount (trade + deposit).

If two or more penalties are caused by the buyer or seller the penalty amount will be greater of the amounts. Penalties are not cumulative.

Ideally, if good communication is established, peers can use trader chat to agree on a penalty amount to relay to their mediator.

Regardless of any penalty amount proposed the mediation proposal will always leave a peer with at least 5% of trade amount. This is to incentivize the peer to accept the mediation proposal rather than take the trade to arbitration where they will likely lose all of their deposit.

|-
| 10% || Using unagreed payment reference. Any unagreed payment reference (also the trade ID) shares the same penalty. &amp;quot;Flowers&amp;quot; could be as bad as &amp;quot;services rendered&amp;quot; depending on every single case
|-
| 10% || Late payment because of low fee for altcoin tx; penalty can be reduced during mediation if buyer uses RBF or similar
|-

|}

&lt;!--
- Release times can&amp;#x27;t be enforced, because at mediation, the last trader to accept the suggestion is the one who decides when the payout is submitted.
- Cannot accept SEPA instant is replaced by buyer or seller&amp;#x27;s penalty &amp;quot;Suggest different payment method - account without mediator&amp;#x27;s acknowledgement.&amp;quot;. This way, an instant SEPA trade could continue as normal SEPA
- All reasons to  cancel a trade are merged, because traders will tend to give the reason that penalizes them less
- I keep the explanation because penalizing a user because their bank asks for info is a controversial matter. I might agree with note 3 but this has been working so far.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Both Bisq traders must follow these &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;trading rules&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to ensure smooth and successful trades.

To trade on Bisq, you assume one of two roles, no matter what national currency or cryptocurrency you’re trading: you either &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buy bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;sell bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

The rules below are &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;default&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; rules for every transaction. Offer makers sometimes specify their own additional terms for handling payments. For example, a seller using cash deposits might require a picture of a receipt torn in half with &amp;quot;NO REFUND&amp;quot; written on it. Face-to-face traders often specify terms about where and how to meet. 

Make sure you’re okay with an offer-maker’s terms &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;before&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; you accept an offer!

Trade rules also help with the following:

* Promoting good behavior from traders
* Penalizing bad behavior from traders
* Promoting good payment accounts of traders
* Penalizing bad payment accounts of traders
* Put the &amp;#x27;wrong doer&amp;#x27; in a worse position and the person &amp;#x27;not at fault&amp;#x27; in a better position

= Common rules =

=== No requirement to reply in trader chat ===

While using the available trade chat can be helpful to resolve issues directly among traders without the overhead of mediation, and being communicative is a good way to ease the process for new traders, there is no obligation to reply to a peer&amp;#x27;s messages.

=== Do not communicate with your peer away from Bisq ===

Using email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is strongly discouraged. The trader chat feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader’s chat messages indicate they broke a rule). This includes advertising offers to sell BTC with a way to contact you, for example a website, Telegram user name, or email.

In any case, it is forbidden to contact the peer using contacts obtained from their payment details, without their prior consent, or missing a compelling reason to do so.

=== Be responsive during a dispute ===

Traders are expected to reply within 48hrs to either mediators or arbitrators, and could lose the dispute based on unresponsiveness.

Mediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.

=== Do not change payment details once trade is in progress ===

Once the deposit transaction is published, the trade is in progress, and its terms cannot be changed. Traders agreed to use the payment details specified in the trade contract.

In the event of an unexpected circumstance (e.g. hitting a bank-imposed transfer limit, or a payment institution interfering with the transaction), traders can propose alternatives through trader chat or mediation, but the peer is not required to comply. It is each trader&amp;#x27;s responsibility to ensure that the payment account in their offer will work before an offer is taken.

= Rules for bitcoin sellers =

Whether making or taking an offer, bitcoin sellers put all the bitcoin they’re selling in the multisig escrow, so there’s less for them to do and fewer rules they need to follow.

=== Click &lt;code&gt;Confirm payment&lt;/code&gt; after receiving payment ===

Sellers have until the end of the maximum trade period to do so.

[[Account_limits#Account_signing|Account signing]], introduced in Bisq v1.2, enables a seller with a signed payment account to sign a buyer’s payment account when they successfully receive a payment. For such trades, it is recommended that the seller take as long as possible (i.e., wait until close to the end of the trade period) to confirm receipt of payment to reduce the chance of a chargeback.

=== Do not confirm payments with mismatching details ===

Payer name, account numbers, payment method, institution, and other details of a payment should match the details in the trade contract. If there are any concerns that buyer&amp;#x27;s payment details do not match (e.g. wrong name, account number etc) payment should not be accepted.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

{{Admonition_Warn|This is especially relevant for trades in which a signed seller trades with an unsigned buyer, because confirmation of payment receipt signs the buyer’s payment account. In case of such an issue, a dispute should be opened.}}

= Rules for bitcoin buyers =

{{Admonition_Warn|To avoid unexpected issues, make sure you can actually carry out a payment with the payment method you’ve set up in Bisq. Examples: Wells Fargo doesn’t allow cash deposits into bank accounts not owned by the depositor, and Zelle has weekly and monthly transfer maximums that are easy to overlook. The software will warn you about known issues, but cannot possibly keep up with all the newest banking and money transfer rules.}}

=== Make payment reasonably early within trade period ===

Buyer should complete at a time such that the seller has enough time to acknowledge receipt of the payment before the trade period is over. Waiting until the very end of the trade period to make a payment is not advised, as then the seller cannot reasonably act in time to acknowledge receipt (also, it’s annoying). The lengths of trade periods vary based on [[Payment methods|payment method]].

This is especially important for buyers with unsigned payment accounts trading with sellers with signed payment accounts. A seller will not want to confirm receipt of a payment made at the last minute from an untrusted account, so if you’re a buyer looking to get your payment account signed, you should make the payment &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;as soon as possible&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Some payment methods include an option to cancel a payment after you have sent it eg Revolut and Interac e-Transfer. If you cancel payment without agreement with the seller or mediator you might end up being penalized for cancelling the trade.

=== Click Payment started after sending payment ===

Seller cannot mark payment as received until buyer confirms that they have sent it. 

Don’t forget to do this!

=== Leave the &amp;quot;reason for payment&amp;quot; field empty ===

{{Admonition_Warn|Before 1.5.5, it was required to put the trade ID in the &amp;#x27;reason for payment&amp;#x27; field of a payment. As of 1.5.5, reason for payment should be left BLANK.}}

Some payments offer a way to specify a reason for payment (some payment methods call it &amp;quot;Message&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Information for recipient&amp;quot; or similar). &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Leave this field BLANK.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Do not put the trade ID, any mentions of &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Bitcoin&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;crypto&amp;quot;, or any other text whatsoever.

If you are required to fill in a reason, use your account name eg &amp;quot;Joe Bloggs&amp;quot; alternatively enter something non-descriptive like a dash &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;. If you would prefer to use other text please agree this with your peer in trader chat. Please remember your peer is not obligated to agree anything and may not want to agree to anything other than leaving the description blank, your name or a dash. 

Violating this rule will likely result in a [[Table of penalties|trade penalty]]. 

Many banks don’t like anything related to Bitcoin, and may take draconian measures if they sense such a transaction.

Many users trade from personal accounts and may object to using anything that looks like it could be a commercial transaction.

=== Pay any transaction fees ===

Any fees incurred to make the payment via the agreed payment method (e.g., bank fees for bank transfer, money-order fees for money orders, etc) are the buyer’s responsibility to pay.

The seller should receive the exact amount of the trade. The only exception to this rule is if the receiving institution imposes a fee on incoming payments—these fees are borne by the seller.

This article is a stub pending the adaptation of the current [[Mediator#Duties]] section here.


[[Mediation]] is a tool used to resolve a dispute between traders. It opens automatically after the trade period is over and the trade has not been completed. It can also be opened manually beforehand if needed by either one of the traders. Before opening a support ticket, traders should remember that they can contact the other party directly by using the Chat provided when the trade opens.


== Trader&amp;#x27;s Instructions ==
* Respond to the Mediator on the support ticket explaining why the ticket was opened. 48 hr response limit.
* Provide proof of payment via a screenshot or PDF if required by the [[Mediator]].
* In case of banking issues, keep detailed information of what happened (i.e. when was your account closed) attaching screenshots.

== Mediator&amp;#x27;s Duties ==
* Contact both parties of the trade (BTC buyer and BTC seller) to find out what the problem is and why the Support ticket was opened.
* Check: Maker Fee Transaction ID, Taker Fee Transaction ID and Deposit Transaction ID to make sure the transaction was published and funds are not stuck.
* If needed, the Mediator will require the private keys from both traders to carry out a manual payout.
* In case of disagreement or unclear information, verified proof of payment may be required to either party by the Mediator.
* Be available on Matrix to help users that may not be able to reach out through the Bisq app.
* Respond within 24 hours.
* When bugs occur, create detailed issues on [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq Github] using the correct repository and notify L2 Support.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Matrix is a messaging platform used by Bisq for discussions of all things related to Bisq. It is also the place for Bisq users to access support agents with any questions they might have.

Matrix replaced Keybase as the main Bisq messaging platform around January 2022. If you are still using Keybase it is recommended to move over to Matrix by visiting [https://bisq.chat/ bisq.chat].

== Matrix ==

[http://www.matrix.org Matrix.org] is a secure, decentralized, real-time communication tool [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/355 replacing Keybase], the tool previously used by Bisq prior to 2022. 
Bisq self-hosts [https://bisq.chat/ bisq.chat], a Matrix team server, which takes a step further on the grade of censorship-resistance and privacy.

== Using Matrix ==

=== Web interface ===

Matrix can be used as a web based app. That&amp;#x27;s a big advantage, specially for users only requiring occasional support and who don&amp;#x27;t need to keep on the day to day conversations.
To start using [bisq.chat] just click the link and you&amp;#x27;ll see a page like this:

[[File:Matrix 1.png|400px|thumb|left]] 

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;continue&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and many Matrix clients will be displayed. Select Element, which is one of the most popular and can be used without installing software. Click the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;continue in your browser&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; button and the [https://app.element.io/#/room/#bisq:bitcoin.kyoto web app Element] will load.
Click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;join&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;create account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, as we suppose you don&amp;#x27;t have a matrix account yet. Next image shows fields needed to host the account at matrix.org. There are other hosts requiring different data to join.

[[File:Matrix create account.png|500px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Joining channels ====

Once the matrix.org hosting account has been created, you&amp;#x27;ll see the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.general:bitcoin.kyoto General] and [[User_support|Support]] channel. &lt;/br&gt;
Click on the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;+&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; sign on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and then &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Explore rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to join other channels, for example [[getting your first BTC|Get your first BTC]].

[[File:Matrix web main screen.png|500px|thumb|left]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Alternatively, after selecting Bisq space icon in the leftmost column, click on the Bisq dropdown and choose &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Explore rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Explore all.jpg|500px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Installing Element ===

To install Element on your desktop, go to [https://element.io/get-started#download], select your OS and follow the instructions. Check other clients and platforms [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/ here]. &lt;/br&gt;
You can also download and install Element on Android or iOS through their app stores.</text></revision></page><page><title>Finding your mediator</title><ns>0</ns><id>153</id><revision><id>3906</id><timestamp>2025-02-06T16:20:58Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Arbitration&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; refers to the last stage of the dispute resolution process—it&amp;#x27;s what takes place in case trader chat and [[Mediation|mediation]] fail to resolve a dispute. 

This page first covers the arbitration process itself, in a practical sense, so that users can be made aware of what to expect when trading. Then it covers the process in more detail, including its motivations, how all the components work together, and how the process is expected to develop in the future.

{{Admonition_Warn|All trades placed from 1st January 2023 will use a new trade protocol ([[Burning Men|Burning Men Protocol]]) that is designed to further improve the decentralization of Bisq.

What this means in practice is IF a trade ends in arbitration the arbitrator will only payout the trade amount plus one users security deposit. Previously they paid out the trade amount plus both user&amp;#x27;s security deposits. Therefore, traders ending in arbitration will notice the following:

* The arbitration &amp;#x27;winner&amp;#x27; will not be compensated for the inconvenience caused by the trade going to arbitration.
* The arbitration &amp;#x27;loser&amp;#x27; will not be be refunded their deposit partially or in full.

Remember arbitration should be seen as the last resort. All efforts should be made for trader to come to an agreement with themselves or via the mediator.}}


== Process ==

Bisq&amp;#x27;s arbitration process is a thoroughly decentralized approach to handling disputes between 2 strangers on the internet: one in which no user needs to trust a third party with authority over their funds, but one in which a user can still expect a satisfactory outcome if they have followed the Bisq [[trading rules]].

Arbitration is only available when:

* one or both traders reject a [[Mediation|mediator’s]] suggested payout
* the time-locked delayed payout transaction is published

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;time-locked delayed payout transaction&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is signed (but not published) at the beginning of the trade process. Its purpose is to allow time for traders and mediators to work out a payout using the funds in the 2-of-2 multisig escrow, and to eliminate the [[#Avoiding_Fraud|possibility of fraud]] in case they can&amp;#x27;t.

Requesting arbitration publishes this time-locked transaction, sending all funds in the multisig escrow (i.e., those of both trading peers) to the Bisq &amp;quot;donation addresses&amp;quot; (which are owned by the [[Burning Men]], Bisq contributors who burn BSQ in advance). This transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for altcoin trades) and 20 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for fiat trades), which means arbitration is only available after this time has passed.

[[Burning Men]] burn BSQ after estimating how many BTC from trading fees and delayed payouts will be during a cycle, and a filter controlled by the DAO distributes the BTC in proportion to how many BSQ have been burned. This keeps BSQ supply balanced, allowing for a corresponding amount of new BSQ to be issued to account for the BTC payouts made to traders as part of arbitration. As a result, BSQ supply is largely unaffected.

This dynamic essentially enables a sort of mutually assured destruction to drive dispute resolution on Bisq without trusted third parties.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;In plain language, here&amp;#x27;s how the process works for traders:&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

# If you’re dissatisfied with the mediator’s suggestion and think you are entitled to a better outcome, request arbitration when it&amp;#x27;s available (doing so publishes the time-locked transaction and sends funds to the donation addresses owned by the Burning Men).
# Collaborate with an arbitrator to clarify the details of your case.
# If the arbitrator agrees you are owed BTC, they will pay it to you.
# The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO so they are not out of pocket.

Takeaway: if you are owed BTC after a dispute, you&amp;#x27;ll get it from an arbitrator who will refund you with their own funds. The arbitrator then requests reimbursement from the Bisq DAO usually once per DAO cycle and asks for the BSQ amount as a reimbursement for the BTC they have refunded Bisq traders. .

== Process, In Detail ==

To better understand arbitration, we need to first understand the new trade protocol, and how it improves upon the old trade protocol.

=== Pre v1.2 Trade Protocol ===

The previous model with 2-of-3 multisig deposit transactions (where an arbitrator was the 3rd key holder, and makes the payout to one of the traders in dispute cases) carried a significant risk: if the arbitrator was malicious (or was hacked), he could have taken all offers with a sockpuppet trader and made the payouts right back to his own sockpuppet. 

This risk made it impossible to scale dispute resolution and find more arbitrators—we were limited to filling the role with a tiny number of Bisq contributors who could be 100% trusted to not be malicious and who had a good enough background in computer security to make getting hacked highly unlikely. 

This element was the single most problematic element in Bisq’s old trade protocol, but since there weren’t any better solutions, we used it for as long as we had to.

=== Post 1.2 Trade Protocol ===

The new trade protocol, launched in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.0 Bisq v1.2], eliminates the risks described above to a large extent by separating functions and involving the DAO. It significantly improves censorship-resistance, security, and scalability of dispute resolution on Bisq.

[[File:Ntp-v12.png|thumb|right|Dispute resolution for trade protocol (v1.2+).]]

The basic change is that it uses a 2-of-2 multisig in the deposit transaction with only the traders’ keys. 

On the happy path, the traders each sign the payout tx once the fiat or altcoin is transferred. 

If anything goes wrong, there are 3 stages to resolve the issue:

# The traders can have a direct chat where they can try to find a solution to their problem.
# If that does not succeed either trader can open a mediation ticket and request help from a mediator. Mediators play a role similar to that of arbitrators in the old model, except they don’t have a 3rd key. They only can make a &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;suggestion&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; for the payout distribution, which either trader is free to accept or reject. If both traders accept, they create and sign the payout tx and the trade is completed. If either trader rejects, the dispute goes to stage 3. This escalation can only take place after a certain time period has passed. For altcoins, this period is 10 days, and for fiat it’s 20 days.
# An arbitrator will investigate the case, just like a mediator would, and decide how a payout should be distributed. The arbitrator role currently has 2 parts: supreme mediator and refund agent (this is where the term &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;refund agent&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; comes from, but &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;arbitrator&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a better term for the role, as we will soon see). The supreme mediator part of the role is similar in function to that of a regular mediator (i.e., investigate a dispute). The refund agent reimburses traders BTC for disputed trades without requiring them to undergo the complex and time-consuming process of making a reimbursement request in the DAO. The ultimate goal, however, is to make such extreme dispute cases so &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;rare&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that requiring users to request reimbursement from the DAO on their own becomes feasible (e.g., by reducing bugs, UX improvements, increasing security deposits, etc). But we’re not there yet, so for now, an arbitrator simply decides on a payout &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; funds this payout from their own pocket, and later makes a reimbursement request to the DAO to be reimbursed for their reimbursement to the user. To avoid [[#Avoiding_Fraud|potential fraud]], and to keep the DAO from losing money in each arbitration case, we use the [[#Donation_Address|donation address]] to receive the funds from the trade via the time-locked delayed payout payout tx.

=== Time-Locked Delayed Payout Payout Transaction ===
Since [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.8 v1.9.8], traders create a time-locked delayed payout payout tx where all the locked up funds (trade amount + both [[security deposit|security deposits]]) are sent to Bisq donation address owners, also known as burningmen. These addresses are defined in the DAO. The burningmen are Bisq contributors who burn their BSQ in order to get a portion of time-locked delayed payouts and trading fees paid in BTC.
From v1.2 to v1.9.8, this address was controlled by a single burning man who exchanged BTC for BSQ to burn them afterwards. That supposed a risk for the DAO as, although the burningman had to place a BSQ bond, the amount of the bond was lower than the amount of expected BTC to collect. Distributing the role into multiple burningman and requiring them to burn BSQ in advance, this risk has significantly decreased.  

If a trade is not completed in 10 days (for altcoins) or 20 days (for fiat), either of the 2 traders have a chance (after mediation) to publish the time-locked payout tx where all deposit funds are sent to the donation address, requiring the aggrieved trader to request arbitration so they can receive a payout. With the preliminary solution we use now, the trader gets a payout from an arbitrator directly, &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;but the eventual goal is that the arbitrator makes a suggestion which the DAO uses as a basis for voting on the reimbursement request made by the trader(s)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

=== Avoiding Fraud ===

The time-locked delayed payout payout tx is essential to avoid fraud. A trader could make a self-trade and then claim that his “peer” has not paid. Without the time-locked payout tx, he could go through the dispute process, make a reimbursement request, and receive BSQ for the equivalent “lost” funds in BTC. After that he could make the payout to himself from the trade, since he controls both “traders”—thereby scamming the DAO with the trade amount. 

To avoid this fraud, we require that locked up funds in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx are spent before opening an arbitration ticket. Thus it is not possible for a trader to defraud the DAO in the way described above.

=== Donation Address Owners (burningmen) ===

Burningmen are current and past contributors who earned BSQ by contributing to Bisq who opt to to burn their BSQ to get BTC from time-locked delayed payout transactions and trading fees paid in BTC. A DAO filter distributes the BTC in proportion to their relative amount of BSQ burned. The amount of BSQ to be burned is limited  for each contributor, to prevent that a single burningman could create self trades and take advantage from being refunded at arbitration and receiving BTC from the DAO filter as well. In order to keep this system safe, it is required that refund agent does not reimburse a security deposit from deposit transaction.
The amount of BSQ to be burned (burn target) is estimated from accumulated reimbursement requests, trade fees paid in BTC and burned BSQ from burningmen in the last 12 months.
The BSQ burned and BTC sent to burningmen should balance over time. Each one of the burningmen, according to their prefferences, could try to &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; a discount rate for the risk assumed advancing their BSQ to the DAO by burning less than the burning target, or they could try to &amp;quot;pay&amp;quot; to avoid  selling big volumes of BSQ to a low liquid market by overburning (up to 100.000 BSQ over the burning target). They could also under or overestimate the amount of BTC to be received over the next year, which is the period that burned amounts decay linearly: the burn target is an estimation with data from the past.
DAO contributors have another way to turn BSQ into BTC while contributing to remove the legacy burningman, which was a central point of failure for the Bisq DAO and created distorsion as a big BSQ buyer. Some burningmen will require to buy BSQ to be burned eventually. The impact for the market will be reduced as there will be multiple interested parties. 


Let’s make a simple example to clarify:

* Two traders are engaged in a 1 BTC trade, with 0.15 BTC each locked in a security deposit
* 1.3 BTC is locked in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx (ignoring miner fees)
* Assume BSQ/BTC is trading at 0.0001 (for easy calculations)

After the required time passes, and the mediation process is closed, one of the traders opens an arbitration case. By doing so, the 1.3 BTC is sent to donation addresses (controlled by the burning men). This transaction was signed by both traders at the time the offer was taken, but was time-locked so it was invalid until the required time had passed. The arbitrator investigates the case and makes a 1.15 BTC payout to the winning trader. He pays this sum from his personal wallet (pre-financing).

We assume that burningmen know there will be only one delayed payout during a cycle: burningmen burned 12,000 BSQ and received the 1.3 BTC into different addresses (which generates a 0.1 BTC profit), each one receiving a % based on the amount they&amp;#x27;ve burned. 
The arbitrator then makes a reimbursement request of 11,500 BSQ to settle his pre-financing. When approved, the DAO issues 11,500 BSQ to the arbitrator. The 0.1 BTC profit for burningmen was subsidized with the 0.15 BTC from the unpaid security deposit. The DAO keeps the other 0.5 BTC in form of reduction in BSQ supply of 0.05 BTC.
Arbitrator will have to burn or sell the BSQ the reimbursed BSQ to get BTC for new payments and reduce volatility risk, which is taking a high risk as they pre-finance the reimbursement. Bisq tries to make arbitration rare as reimbursing traders has a big cost.

=== Why We Cannot Merge the Arbitrator and Burning Man Roles ===

The separation of these roles is essential to keep the system flexible, censorship-resistant, and scalable. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Keep in mind that the current dual role of arbitrators (i.e., supreme mediator and refund agent) is not the ultimate goal&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The refund agent part of the role should be delegated to traders once the trade process is improved to a level where such cases rarely happen. How to keep the burden for traders low, and how to compensate them for this extra work—these items are still up for discussion (e.g. the trader could get a slight bonus if he does the reimbursement himself). A preferred option is to keep trader-submitted reimbursement requests optional and still offer arbitrator-funded reimbursements for a fee. The role could even be split, such that a market of refund agents develops where each agent offers their pre-financing services at different prices. But before getting into any of these discussions, we need to reduce bugs and improve UX.

The role of the burning man has been distributed between different contributors and  a part of their earnings come directly as BTC, but it could also disappear when we have very few dispute cases, and once trade fees in BTC do not add up to a large amount. We could use the donation address to support critical infrastructure we use like Tor. Or we could use it to fund Bisq projects like the mobile wallet.  There are many possibilities for how we could use these funds—but if we merged the burning man role with the arbitrator role, we would lose this flexibility.

The risks of the 2 roles are very different. An arbitrator does not present any severe risk to the DAO, actually, he &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;takes on&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; a lot of risk. A single burning man, on the other hand, is a trusted role and there is an open problem that a malicious burning man could make many trades, go to the arbitrator, get payouts, and then run away with the funds he received from the donation address. The high bond is a partial protection, but ultimately, this is a trusted role and only highly trusted Bisq contributors can take it on. This problem has been mitigated by distributing the role between different contributors with a cap on how much BTC they can get. So scalability is a small issue with the distributed burningmen, but we cannot say the same about the arbitrator. With more traders, there will be more cases, and we might need more arbitrators. Furthermore, with more regional expansion, we will need arbitrators with particular language skills. When arbitrators and burningmen are not combined into one role, we can add arbitrators to support this growth without posing high risk to the Bisq network. If we merged both roles, we would not be able to do this. There is a risk arbitrators expose to the DAO: they could fake their reporting, but this is likely solvable (traders can provide evidence).

Another important aspect is that arbitrator reimbursement is not automated. DAO stakeholders have ultimate power. Sure, they would probably lose an arbitrator if they don’t reimburse him fairly, and it might be hard to find new arbitrators after unfair behaviour from DAO stakeholders. But it is highly important that stakeholders be able to exercise absolute power.

Another consideration: if the process to reimburse arbitrators were automated, the result would probably involve legal risks that we want to avoid. The role would then adopt elements of a custodial function, and that would likely trigger regulatory issues.

=== FAQ ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;What are the conditions that lead to a payout, for example, a dispute between Bob and Alice that is not resolved by normal mediation and gets escalated to arbitration?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

After the time-lock period (10 days for altcoins and 20 days for fiat), and after mediation is completed, either trader can open an arbitration ticket. Doing so publishes the time-locked delayed payout transaction.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How are Bob and Alice&amp;#x27;s BTC funds paid out to the Bisq donation addresses?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

The time-locked payout transaction is created and signed in the take-offer process and stored by both traders. The trade protocol requires this transaction to be in place before a trade is started.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How is the arbitrator responsible for deciding what the payout distribution should be? Are facts and circumstances of the case taken into account? And how is this similar to legacy arbitration?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

In terms of determining what a payout should be, an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s role is the same as that of a mediator. They&amp;#x27;ll ask you for any additional information they need to determine the facts and circumstances of the case. The only practical difference between arbitration and legacy arbitration is that arbitrators use their own funds to pay trader(s) instead of funds from the trading escrow.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How, upon deciding a payout, does an arbitrator pay the BTC to Bob and Alice?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Arbitrators need to have enough BTC to cover potential payouts (up to 0.5 BTC per trade) — it&amp;#x27;s a requirement for anyone seeking to hold the role. An arbitration case can only be closed once an arbitrator makes a payout. Then, at the end of the DAO cycle, they&amp;#x27;ll get reimbursed with BSQ (which they can then sell for BTC).

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Are there any trades the arbitrator will not pay out? &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Arbitrators will only reimburse trades in which the multisig deposit has been sent to the Bisq donation addresses. For trades requiring large reimbursements (above 0.5 BTC) they should be aware the arbitrators will only [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/296 partially reimburse traders up to 0.5 BTC]. Should a trader require a reimbursement over 0.5 BTC they can make a reimbursement request directly to the DAO on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support support repository]. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does the arbitrator issue a reimbursement request for an amount of BSQ equivalent to the amount of BTC paid out-of-pocket to settle disputes?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

This process is a work in progress. Currently we try to reduce volatility and exposure risk by converting pre-financed BTC to BSQ as fast as possible. Once it is BSQ there is no longer any volatility risk, and the arbitrator simply sums up all pre-financed BSQ and requests reimbursement. The public result of an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s work is a reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does the DAO issue this BSQ to reimburse arbitrators?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

A reimbursement request is technically the same as a compensation request. DAO stakeholders vote on an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s request. The arbitrator needs to provide solid reporting to make their request transparent to the DAO. Currently there is some trust involved, since it cannot be proven that the arbitrator is not adding fake cases. This may be solvable by collecting data from traders, but this requires more thought.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Doesn&amp;#x27;t this dispute resolution mechanism incentivize Bisq to have more trades go to arbitration, since disputed BTC funds are sent to the burningmen, and thereby benefit BSQ holders and themselves?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

It&amp;#x27;s the traders who open arbitration, the DAO can&amp;#x27;t start arbitration, although it could generate bugs and be unresponsive at mediation. In this case, traders will be fully reimbursed (which will generate a loss for the DAO, as arbitrator charges for every arbitration case) if they have done enough reporting the issue and trying to get [[User_support|support]] through Matrix or Github. 
Bugs and requiring arbitration is a bad user experience, so the DAO is also incentivized to keep arbitration and mediation cases at the minimum.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does an arbitrator spends their newly-issued BSQ?

The arbitrator sells BSQ for BTC from the market and burns BSQ as soon as reimbursement request is paid.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;How does the burningman burn the BSQ they earn or buy?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Burning is done inside the Bisq software on &lt;code&gt;DAO / Burning / Burningmen&lt;/code&gt;.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Why not simply combine the burning man and arbitrator roles?&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

[[#Why_We_Cannot_Merge_These_Roles|See longer explanation above]]. In short: to stay flexible, to be able to implement the target vision (reimbursement done by traders themselves), to avoid legal risks, to keep the arbitrator role scalable, and to address the trust/security issue with the current burning man model.

Arbitrators investigate disputes, just like mediators. But unlike mediators, whose suggestions encourage traders to make payouts from their own escrowed funds, an arbitrator&amp;#x27;s findings lead to a payout from the arbitrator themselves.

== Role Notes ==

=== Arbitrator&amp;#x27;s Role in Dispute Resolution ===

Currently, the arbitrator makes BTC payouts to aggrieved traders out of their own pocket and gets refunded by the Bisq DAO (hence the term &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;refund agent&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; used sometimes). But this arrangement is intended as a convenience so that traders can avoid making a reimbursement request to the DAO on their own. 

The arbitrator role is one element of Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralized dispute resolution process. Please see more details at [[Arbitration|arbitration]].

=== Arbitrator versus Legacy Arbitrator ===

Although arbitrators have been a component of dispute resolution on Bisq since its early days, the v1.2 update wholly changed the nature of the role.

Before the update, trade funds were secured in a 2-of-3 multisig escrow, in which arbitrators held the third key. They would evaluate disputes and then sign funds to traders as they saw fit. Since these arbitrators (which we now refer to as &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;legacy arbitrators&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;) had some element of control over users&amp;#x27; funds, those who filled the role had to be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;very&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; highly trusted.

The v1.2 update enabled trade funds to be secured in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow, in which arbitrators have &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;no involvement&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Mediators handle most disputes, but if an arbitrator does get involved, payouts either come from the arbitrator&amp;#x27;s own pocket or from the Bisq DAO. Arbitrators are still trusted to conduct their role with integrity and consistency, but this is a wholly different kind of trust, one that is unrelated to the handling of users&amp;#x27; funds, and thus one that doesn&amp;#x27;t even require a bond.

Below is a compilation of &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;frequently-asked questions (FAQ)&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; about Bisq, how to use it, and how to help the project. 

Feel free to ask further questions on any of Bisq&amp;#x27;s many outreach channels. 

== About ==

==== How is Bisq different from other decentralized exchanges? ====

Bisq is a peer-to-peer trading network, not a website or &amp;quot;app&amp;quot; or other centralized service. It&amp;#x27;s software you run on your own hardware, which connects to other people running the Bisq software to facilitate trades. It&amp;#x27;s open-source and community-driven.

And you can trade bitcoin for fiat currencies with it!

The difference between Bisq and other so-called decentralized exchanges is as stark as the difference between owning your own home and renting someone else&amp;#x27;s—in the former case you have full control over the property, and in the latter you&amp;#x27;re always subject to the landlord&amp;#x27;s whims and demands (no matter how nice the landlord may seem to be).

With Bisq you&amp;#x27;re always the owner—not just owner of your bitcoin, but also owner of your data.

* Bisq does not hold any bitcoin. All bitcoin used for trading is held in &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;2-of-2 multisignature addresses&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; controlled solely by the trading peers themselves.
* Bisq does not hold any national currency. National currency is transferred directly from one trader to the other using traditional banking and payment services.
* All Bisq data is transferred over its own secure peer-to-peer network, which is built on top of the Tor network—no central servers. This means &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;there are no data honeypots&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, rendering large-scale hacks of customer information databases impossible.
* Bisq does not know anything about traders who use its network, and no data is stored on who trades with whom.
* Bisq does not require registration, so your privacy is protected, and you can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;begin trading instantly&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
* Bisq is code, not a company. It is an open-source project organized as a [[Decentralized_autonomous_organization|decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)]] built on top of Bitcoin.

==== Is Bisq open-source software? ====

Bisq&amp;#x27;s software is free/libre open-source licensed under Version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. 

Here&amp;#x27;s the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq source code] and [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/LICENSE license].

==== Is Bisq safe? ====

Thanks to strong incentives encouraging traders to play fairly, the vast majority of trades on Bisq go smoothly and quickly.

Bisq employs three primary mechanisms to achieve security:

* All bitcoin traded with Bisq is secured in a 2-of-2 multisignature address.
* Both traders are required to pay security deposits, which are refunded after trades are completed.
* Trade disputes are handled through a [[Dispute_resolution|3-tier mechanism]] that includes end-to-end encrypted trader chat, mediation, and arbitration.

When trading fiat currency for bitcoin, there is always some chargeback risk, as fiat transactions can often be reversed.

To mitigate this risk, Bisq:

* only supports payment methods which are known to make chargebacks difficult—this is why Bisq does not support PayPal and credit cards, for example. See more on chargeback risks.
* employs an [[Account_limits#Account_signing account|signing mechanism]] that forces 0.01 BTC buy limits until a buyer&amp;#x27;s integrity (not identity!) is verified.

== Getting started ==

==== I find Bisq very confusing. I&amp;#x27;ve tried using it but just end up getting lost! ====

Some people find Bisq&amp;#x27;s interface intuitive, but many people don&amp;#x27;t. Check out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDkzUl9wibc this tour video] to help you make sense of the interface, and then check out the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjmpAq9RUXM Bird&amp;#x27;s Eye View of a Bisq Trade] video for a high-level overview of how Bisq trading works.

Then check out the [https://bisq.network/getting-started getting-started guide] to see how to get up and running quickly.

As of April 2021, Bisq contributors have designed a whole new beautiful interface that should make Bisq significantly more intuitive, and are also in touch with a talented UI developer to turn the design into code. You can follow progress on this initiative [https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/49 here].

==== I can&amp;#x27;t use Bisq to trade because there are hardly ever any offers in my currency. What can I do? ====

While Bisq can technically support any market, only a handful of markets are consistently active on Bisq—mainly because they offer good payment methods and had strong on-the-ground support to bootstrap them in the beginning.

{{Admonition_Note|Note that a weak offer book in a particular market doesn&amp;#x27;t &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;necessarily&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; mean trades don&amp;#x27;t take place in that market. It could be that there are people lurking there that will happily take an offer if you take the initiative to make one (this is often the case in markets like CAD, AUD, and GBP, for example).

You can check trade history for your market by going to &lt;code&gt;Market&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Trades&lt;/code&gt; and picking your currency from the dropdown.}}

If your market has no recent trades, a little more work will need to be done to get it going. At a minimum, payment methods common in your market should be added ([https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new/choose suggest them here]), and some form of marketing should be done to get users and market-makers to bootstrap a market.

Bisq contributors are more than happy to help if you can help with guidance, connections to people who can help, and/or events and translations and other vehicles for reaching your target demographics.

==== I heard I need bitcoin in order to buy bitcoin on Bisq...but I don&amp;#x27;t have any bitcoin. What can I do? ====

Yes, the chicken-and-egg problem with Bisq is real. 

Here are some ways to get just enough bitcoin to do your first trade on Bisq:
* try to obtain some yourself using [https://bisq.wiki/Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin these suggestions]
* hop onto the &lt;code&gt;Get your first BTC&lt;/code&gt; room on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] and make a deal ([[Informal_Market_for_Small_BTC_Trades|see more here]])
* Try the [[Bisq Easy]] protocol on [[Bisq 2]], as no deposit is required.

== Trading ==

==== What are trading fees? ====

[[Trading fees]] are calculated as a percentage of trade size: 0.1% for makers and 0.7% for takers if paid in BTC and about half of that if paid in BSQ.

Keep in mind that you&amp;#x27;ll also need to pay [[mining fees]] for the on-chain transactions, as well as a deposit to lock into the multisig escrow. You&amp;#x27;ll get the deposit back in full after the trade completes successfully.

==== Mining fees are too high. How can I trade on Bisq cost-effectively? ====

Bisq&amp;#x27;s current trade protocol requires 4 on-chain transactions. Takers pay for 3 of these transactions and makers pay for 1 of them.

Therefore, to make trading on Bisq as cost-effective as possible, consider &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;making your own offers&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; at times &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;when mining fees are lower&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Other things you can do: 
* make offers to trade &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;larger amounts of BTC&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (bigger offers tend to get better pricing)
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;pay trade fees with BSQ&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (BSQ trade fees tend to be about half of BTC trading fees)

==== Why does Bisq require a security deposit in BTC? ====

[[Security deposit | Security deposits]] create strong incentives for buyers and sellers to follow the [[Trading rules|rules of Bisq&amp;#x27;s trading protocol]]. Deposits are locked into multisig escrow along with the bitcoin being traded, and are returned to each user when the trade is complete.

If a trade is disputed through a mediator or arbitrator, some or all of the offending party&amp;#x27;s security deposit may be awarded to the counterparty. Examples of protocol violations include a buyer failing to pay a seller, paying with a different account or with a different name, or a seller failing to acknowledge receipt of a buyer&amp;#x27;s payment.

Most Bisq trades complete without any problem thanks in part to the incentives that security deposits create.

See full [[trading rules]].

==== What are trading limits? How much bitcoin can I buy/sell at once? ====

Trading limits vary based on payment method, since some payment methods are more secure than others.

Relatively safe payment methods such as Japan&amp;#x27;s Furikomi and Australia&amp;#x27;s PayID are set to allow trades of up to 0.5 BTC, but other payment methods such as Zelle and SEPA have a cap of 0.125 BTC. See the [[Payment_methods|full list of payment methods and limits]].

Altoins are not possible to charge back, so all altcoin trades have a limit of 1 BTC.

==== Which payment methods are available? ====

See [[payment methods]].

If you&amp;#x27;d like to suggest a payment method to be added, please [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new/choose submit a new issue].

==== How does Bisq handle fiat like dollars and euros? Where does it go? ====

Bisq doesn&amp;#x27;t handle fiat at all -- it only handles BTC. Trades are settled outside of Bisq, meaning fiat payments are sent outside Bisq via traditional banking services.

Bisq merely matches peers and sets incentives (e.g. locking a BTC security deposit from both peers, as a sort of escrow) to encourage both trading peers to act in good faith. This is also why you need bitcoin to begin trading on Bisq.

==== How long does a trade take? ====

There is no automatic order matching on Bisq, and trades are settled manually by humans. As a result, trades are not completed as quickly as they would be on centralized exchanges, but can still be fairly quick. 

Some payment methods are instant (e.g., Faster Payment) while others can take a few days (e.g., SEPA).

As far as Bisq is concerned, the deposit transaction needs to be confirmed once before the buyer can send payment. Bitcoin transactions take about 10 minutes to confirm, so with quick traders and quick payment method, a Bisq trade can be completed in a matter of minutes.

Altcoin trade periods are always 1 day (or 1 hour for Altcoins Instant trades).

See the list of [[payment methods]] for complete details.

==== How does Bisq protect my privacy? ====

Bisq is standalone, open-source software that you can inspect before running on your machine, and as a result, you don&amp;#x27;t have to trust that any server is logging your personal details (as you would in the case of a website).

As for the trading process, your payment information is stored locally on your machine, and only your trading partner (and your mediator or arbitrator, in case of a dispute) can ever see it. All data exchanged between users is encrypted and signed.

To transmit data from one user to another, Bisq uses a P2P network built on top of Tor, which provides a high degree of anonymity. The user doesn&amp;#x27;t need to do any additional work for all of this to work—it is all integrated in the application.

==== Do I need to keep Bisq online for my offers to remain online? ====

Yes. There are no central servers on the Bisq network—so all peers are responsible for keeping their offers online.

If you have published an offer, your Bisq application needs to stay online so it can react when another trader wants to take your offer (the multisig deposit transaction is created in the take-offer process). Be sure you have deactivated your computer&amp;#x27;s standby mode so your Bisq application can stay online (monitor standby is not a problem).

If your Bisq application does go offline, your offer will get removed from the distributed offerbook. It will be re-published the next time you start your Bisq application.

After an offer has been taken and the trade process has started, neither trader needs to be online continuously, but each trader will need to be online periodically to check if any action is needed on their side (e.g. sending fiat/altcoin, confirming payment receipt, etc).

==== Do I have to use the Bisq wallet? ====

No, but you may find it convenient to keep a small amount of trading capital there.

When entering a new trade on Bisq, you will get the option to transfer funds from your Bisq wallet &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;or&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; send funds from an external wallet.

Likewise, when concluding a trade on Bisq, you can withdraw your funds to the Bisq wallet or to an external wallet.

==== Do I have to use the Bisq token? ====

No, using BSQ is totally optional. However, using it gets you a ~50% discount on [[trading fees]] while helping to [[Introduction_to_the_DAO#Earn_and_distribute_revenue|compensate Bisq contributors]] at the same time.

==== Will my bank know I&amp;#x27;m trading bitcoin? ====

Generally speaking, Bisq doesn&amp;#x27;t deal with banks at all. All fiat transfers take place directly between users.

But there have been reports of banks closing accounts upon suspecting bitcoin activity. As a result, Bisq requires that the &amp;quot;reason for payment&amp;quot; field always be left BLANK when making a payment (if the payment method offers such a field).

If a reason is required, it should be something trivial like a &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;payment&amp;quot;. If you want to use something else, please agree on an alternative with your peer using trader chat.
See full [[trading rules]] for more information.

== Common Technical Niggles ==

==== Bisq on macOS won&amp;#x27;t open, or it&amp;#x27;s asking for permission to record my keystrokes! ==== 

If Bisq won&amp;#x27;t open, try right-clicking the app and clicking &lt;code&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt;.

If you get the prompt asking to record your keystrokes, rest assured it&amp;#x27;s a [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373 bug] (Bisq is absolutely not recording your keystrokes). This bug should be fixed with a [[https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/44|Java LTS version update]] coming soon.

==== Bisq seems to bog down my computer. When I open it, CPU and memory usage spike. Can this be prevented? ====

Bisq has had memory usage and CPU usage issue on certain operating systems in the past, but these issues should be resolved now. You can manually set the max RAM usage by following [[Reducing_memory_usage|these instructions]].

Chances are Bisq is probably just trying to sync blockchain data. New releases of Bisq include data stores updated at release time to reduce this syncing time, but as a release gets older (i.e., beyond 3-4 weeks old), the data stores get older, and syncing takes longer. Just let it finish and your computer resources should go back down to normal again.

If the issue doesn&amp;#x27;t go away on its own, please reach out for help in the &lt;code&gt;Support&lt;/code&gt; room [https://bisq.chat on Matrix] or open an issue [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq on GitHub].

==== I&amp;#x27;m on a high-resolution monitor on Linux and everything is way too small. Help? ====

See [[Running_on_HiDPI_screen|this article]] for a tip on fixing this issue.

==== Bisq says &amp;quot;this offer cannot be taken due to counterparty trade restrictions&amp;quot;. What does that mean? ====

This happens in rare circumstances.  Bisq checks information about an account such as its age to determine if it is allowed to trade over certain limits.  The information is stored in the P2P network, and it may not yet have propagated to your node.  Try again after restarting Bisq.  The offer maker may need to restart Bisq in order for the information to propagate.

==== My SPV resync is taking all day and it keeps freezing.  What can I do to make it go faster? ====

Unfortunately this can happen sometimes if your wallet is over a year old and/or has a lot of transactions.  If the resync stalls, close and restart Bisq to continue the resync.  It will go faster if you [[Connecting_to_your_own_Bitcoin_node|connect to a local Bitcoin node]].
After your SPV resync is completed, it would be best to switch to a fresh wallet.

==== How can I get a fresh Bisq wallet and transfer my BSQ balance to it? ====

The procedure involves setting aside the existing wallet directory (by renaming) in order to get a fresh wallet.  The wallet directory is at &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/wallet&lt;/code&gt; from the [[Data_directory|main data directory location]].  You&amp;#x27;ll then be able to activate either the old or new wallet by renaming the directory before starting Bisq.  Be sure that Bisq is never running when you rename a directory.
# You have some BSQ and also some BTC balance existing in your wallet.  (You need BTC to pay mining fees for sending BSQ).  
# Close Bisq then rename your &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; directory to &lt;code&gt;oldWallet&lt;/code&gt;. 
# Start Bisq and it will create a fresh wallet.  Note down your BSQ receiving address and also your BTC receiving address.  Write down your recovery seed phrase (Under Account / Wallet Seed menu) and store it in a safe place (not online).  
# Close Bisq and rename your &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; dir to &lt;code&gt;newWallet&lt;/code&gt;, rename your old wallet dir to &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt;, then restart Bisq.  
# Send BSQ to your new receiving address you saved in the earlier step.  Then send BTC the same way.  Close Bisq.  
# Rename &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;oldWallet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;newWallet&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt;.  Then restart Bisq.

Done!  Your BSQ and BTC balances have been moved to a fresh wallet.

==== &amp;quot;heightOfLastBlock must match chainHeight&amp;quot; error on starting Bisq ====

The following procedure should fix itː
* make a backup of your data folder
* close Bisq
* from inside data folder, delete DaoStateStore and BsqBlocks
* restart Bisq

==== &amp;quot;Payment started&amp;quot; button will not stick, always says &amp;quot;Please send confirmation again&amp;quot; ====

This is a known issue, stemming from how the application will err on the side of caution when P2P network conditions are less than favorable.
It most often happens when the peer is offline, so usually when a seller taker accepts an open offer with a non-instant payment method, like SEPA, and then goes offline, since the payment will take at least a day to be credited and they do not need to stay connected while the buyer maker&amp;#x27;s payment arrives.
Here are some things that might work
* Send a message in trader chat
* Insist on pressing the button tens of times
* Restart Bisq
* Follow menus &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Settings&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; -&gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Network Info&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; -&gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Open Tor Settings&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; -&gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Delete Outdated Tor Files And Shutdown&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, then restart Bisq
* Do nothing and stay online, as the button will sometimes finally &amp;quot;register&amp;quot; by itself with a random delay
* When everything else fails, and the trade period is almost at its end, communicate your intentions to the peer in trader chat and open mediation by pressing Ctrl-O in trade window, explaining what happened to the mediator, even better by attaching a screenshot of the issue; a support ticket will be opened and both peers will have the opportunity to accept the original payout

==== I want to install Bisq on a VPS or on an otherwise headless system ====

Bisq needs a graphical desktop environment to be ran, but in order to keep offers online without the need to have your PC always on, some users reported good results by using https://www.xpra.org as a graphical endpoint which you can forward to a client.

==== I receive an error message on Linux, regarding &lt;code&gt;Java heap space&lt;/code&gt; ====

You can increase the memory allowance to Bisq, by editing the file &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/lib/app/Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt;, to make it read &lt;code&gt;java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=16g&lt;/code&gt; where it says &lt;code&gt;java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=8g&lt;/code&gt;


==== Cannot take offer because snapshot height does not match. Probably your DAO data are not synced ====

This error means that the DAO data across you and your prospective trade peer is not in consensus (latest block height doesn&amp;#x27;t match). To make sure the issue is not on your side, go to Settings &gt; Preferences, and click on the button &amp;quot;Rebuild DAO state from resources&amp;quot;, you will be asked to restart Bisq (do it) and it will resync DAO data. Wait until the &amp;quot;Synchronizing DAO&amp;quot; message at the bottom disappears (it will take a while, and you can check the progress by navigating to DAO &gt; BSQ Wallet &gt; Transactions, where you will notice a progress bar at the bottom), and try taking the offer again. If it works, you had an out-of-sync DAO and just fixed the issue, but if the problem persists, it is a hint that your peer has an out-of-sync DAO state, and you will be unable to take the offer until the issue is fixed on the other side.

== Dispute resolution ==

==== How does dispute resolution work? ====

Bisq provides a 3-layer mechanism for resolving disputes: trader chat, mediation, and arbitration.

Trader chat enables traders to resolve small issues themselves privately over end-to-end encrypted chat right in Bisq. If this doesn&amp;#x27;t work, traders can engage a mediator to examine the situation and suggest a payout. In rare circumstances that mediation fails, a trader can choose to engage an arbitrator to re-examine the situation and make a payout.

Veteran users: please note that the arbitrator role changed significantly with the launch of the new trade protocol on v1.2.

See [[trading rules]] and [[dispute resolution]] for more.

==== How is collusion between mediators, arbitrators, and traders prevented? ====

With the launch of the new trading protocol in v1.2, multisig escrows went from 2-of-3 to 2-of-2 arrangements, so that only the two trading peers have control of trading funds (instead of the 2 trading peers and an arbitrator). With no keys in the multisig escrow, it is no longer possible for a mediator or arbitrator to collude with another trader to release funds maliciously.

Mediators and arbitrators are still bonded roles, however, because even though they cannot sign a payout transaction to resolve a dispute, they can &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;advise&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; how to resolve a dispute, and it&amp;#x27;s important that they be responsive, responsible, and fair when doing so.

==== What happens if the person buying bitcoin does a chargeback after the bitcoin has been released from the multisig address? ====

Bisq only supports payment methods for which chargebacks are not easy (e.g., this is why PayPal and credit cards are not supported). But there is still a little chargeback risk with banks. If a bank executes a chargeback after the BTC has been released, there is nothing a mediator or arbitrator can do.

Bisq&amp;#x27;s goal is to make this scenario as unattractive as possible, using three primary mechanisms:

# [[Account limits|Account aging]] requires newly-created fiat payment accounts on Bisq to have lower trade limits, and those limits are increased over time.
# [[Account_limits#Account_signing|Account signing]] requires higher-risk payment methods to be signed upon verifying the integrity of a trader before account aging kicks in. Until such accounts are signed, buy limits are set to 0.01 BTC.
# National currency payment methods which are found to be used for chargebacks are quickly removed.

==== Wouldn&amp;#x27;t a pure reputation system among traders make mediators and arbitrators unnecessary? ====

Pure reputation without additional dispute resolution measures is a weak protection system, as you can never avoid [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick long con] attacks.

Such mechanisms are also problematic for protecting privacy and for keeping the service decentralized.

==== How can I contact my trading peer? ====

Bisq has a built-in end-to-end encrypted [[Dispute_resolution#Level_1:_Trader_chat|chat mechanism]] that you can use to talk to your trading peer while the trade is in progress.

== DAO ==

==== What is the Bisq DAO? ====

The Bisq DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is a decentralized governance mechanism for the Bisq software, built on Bitcoin. It takes the place of a company. How good can decentralized software possibly be if it&amp;#x27;s still controlled by a single entity, like a company?

Decentralized software is no good without decentralized governance.

That&amp;#x27;s why Bisq is not a company or legal entity of any kind—instead, it&amp;#x27;s organized as a DAO. The DAO handles the software&amp;#x27;s funding and strategy-making to enable the Bisq network to thrive, and at the same time, harden it against attacks on the infrastructure that powers its leadership and operation.

In a nutshell, the Bisq DAO enables Bisq to become even more censorship-resistant, a core [[Introduction|principle of the project]] from the very beginning.

Read more about the Bisq DAO in [[Introduction_to_the_DAO|this introductory article]].

==== How does the Bisq DAO work? ====

The primary purposes of the Bisq DAO are financing the project and determining strategy.

# Trading fees are distributed directly from traders to contributors with a token (colored bitcoin) called BSQ.
# Strategy is determined collectively through voting done in the Bisq software and recorded on the Bitcoin network.

Learn more about how this actually works in [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e this series of short 3-5 minute videos].

See [[Decentralized_autonomous_organization|this article]] for a full list of resources to learn more.

==== What do I need to know about the DAO, as a trader? ====

First of all, you are NOT required to use the BSQ token or Bisq DAO to use Bisq.

But there are benefits to doing so: you&amp;#x27;ll pay lower trading fees by using BSQ instead of BTC.

But why have the BSQ token at all? Because it enables Bisq contributors to be paid for their work without any central wallets or points of control. When you buy BSQ, you&amp;#x27;re directly paying a Bisq contributor for their work, and in the process, helping to sustain the whole project. The dynamic this token enables is not possible with plain bitcoin.

When you use BSQ to pay trading fees, it&amp;#x27;s destroyed and &amp;#x27;burned&amp;#x27; out of existence.

[[Introduction_to_the_DAO#Overview|See more on this dynamic here]].

==== Is Bisq using a token because it needs money? What&amp;#x27;s the issuance schedule for the token? ====

Bisq already earns revenue from trading fees. It&amp;#x27;s not launching this DAO and BSQ token for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;earning&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; revenue—it&amp;#x27;s doing it to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;distribute&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the revenue it already earns to more people without any central points of control.

BSQ tokens are issued every time a contributor&amp;#x27;s compensation request is approved through voting, and the tokens are destroyed every time a trader uses BSQ to pay trading fees.

BSQ issuance is not a 1-time event, and its purpose is not to raise capital. You can see a walk-through of the BSQ issuance process in [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e this video series].

==== Can I use Bisq without BSQ and without this DAO? ====

You can pay [[trading fees]] with BTC instead of BSQ. Since v1.9.8, the DAO has to be always activated.

Before the Bisq DAO, trading fees went to just a couple of wallets owned by specific Bisq contributors (arbitrators). All other contributors were not paid. Bisq needs its contributors to be paid in regular, predictable ways to ensure continual (and reliable) development, service, and growth; the Bisq DAO enables this to happen by distributing trading fees to all contributors in a totally decentralized way.

The Bisq DAO and BSQ enable a funding and governance mechanism that is [[https://bisq.network/blog/bisq-dao-for-bitcoin-maximalists/ not possible with plain bitcoin]]. We highly recommend you check [[Decentralized_autonomous_organization|out the documentation]] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e video series]] to learn more.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Bisq is a decentralized bitcoin exchange network.

Bisq provides a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange experience via software that runs locally on the user&amp;#x27;s computer. There are two software versions users can choose to run:

== Bisq 1 ==
Bisq 1 is a well-established peer-to-peer exchange that began in 2016, originally known as Bit Square. Over time, the platform has consistently improved, offering traders a decentralized, peer-to-peer environment to buy and sell Bitcoin for fiat currencies and a variety of altcoins. Individual trade sizes on Bisq 1 can reach {{MaxTradeSizeBisq1}} for fiat trades and {{MaxTradeSizeAltcoin}} for altcoin trades. Security is ensured through a multisig deposit system, allowing trades to safely occur between strangers.

&lt;big&gt;[[Bisq 1|Find out more about Bisq 1]].&lt;/big&gt;

== Bisq 2 ==

[[Bisq 2]] was launched in 2024. [[Bisq 2]] will have a range of [[trade protocols]]. The first one launched, and currently the only one available, is [[Bisq Easy]]. This allows traders, using a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform, to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currency. Individual trade sizes on [[Bisq Easy]] are limited to the equivalent of 600 USD. Security for the trades is provided through the [[reputation]] of the BTC sellers. There are no trade fees on [[Bisq Easy]], and no deposit requirements. [[Bisq Easy]] is expected to replace [[Bisq 1 ]]for fiat trades of less than {{MaxBisqEasyTrade}}.

= Generic =

== Bisq won&amp;#x27;t start ==

See [[Troubleshooting network issues]].

== My wallet has an incorrect balance ==

* Resyncing your simplified payment verification (SPV) file may resolve this. See [[Delete and resync SPV file]]

== Bisq is using too much RAM ==

* Limiting the maximum amount of RAM the JVM is allowed to use may resolve this. See [[Reduce JVM MAXRam]]

* On Linux, restricting memory arena allocation can reduce Bisq&amp;#x27;s off-heap memory consumption. See [[Linux_Memory_Arenas]]

= Windows specific =

== Bisq app appears in taskbar, but clicking it opens a blank window ==

Try to maximize the Bisq window.

* Find the Bisq shortcut you use to start Bisq
* Right click on it &gt; select &amp;quot;shortcut&amp;quot; &gt; Change the Run dropdown from &amp;quot;Normal size window&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Maximized&amp;quot;

__TOC__

==Requirements==

Bisq support agents play a vital role in assisting users who encounter issues. In addition to delivering quality customer support, a support agent must:

* Be a Bisq user, proficient enough to assist others.
* Dedicate 10 hours per week to monitor various support channels and provide assistance.
* Be familiar with Bisq&amp;#x27;s current [knowledge base] documents.

If you&amp;#x27;re interested in becoming a support agent, see the [[#Internship]] section below.

==Infrastructure==

Includes all of [[Support Team#Infrastructure]], plus the following:

=== Calendar ===

The calendar tracks support events.

* [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u4eea6bffk10b76l2cmb86eqqc%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=Europe%2FVienna Public HTML]

===GitHub team===
* [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/support-agents @bisq-network/support-agents] (includes l1, l2 and intern subteams)

===Role issue===
* [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64 L1 Support Agent #64]

==Duties==

===Handle support cases===
Bisq support agents will dedicate at least 10 hours each week to monitor the various support channels and assist users with their issues.

===Report issues to developers===
Required data to request support from developers:

* Create a directory with the trade ID as name
* Add a short description in a plain text file of the problem/bug. Use BTC buyer/BTC seller if you refer to any trader. Ask user when the issue happened so its easier to find the issue in the logs.
* Ask them if they have done anything non-standard or had past issues.
* Add all available trade tx IDs of both traders as plain text to the report.
* Get a screenshot of the trade details window (click on trade ID). Tell users to only blur out the payment account details but not the tx IDs or other data. There is no relevant privacy issue with exposing trade ID, tx IDs or onion address.
* Add a screenshot from the mediators dispute details window. The contract as json data is not required initially and only needed if the dev requests it. The payment account data in the json file should be removed before handing over to a dev to protect traders privacy.
* Get all log files from both users (at Account/Backup there is a button for opening the data dir) - its up to 11 files.
* Put all logs from one user into a directory named buyer and seller
* Add a screenshot of both traders first chat message (system message containing data like version number/OS,...)
* If there have been any error/warning popups request a screenshot of that as well.
* Zip all and send it on Matrix chat as PM to a dev who has committed to work on it. Avoid adding it to the support channel as then nobody will feel responsible to work on it.

===Attend weekly support calls===
Bisq support agents will attend weekly calls to discuss current issues.  

===Submit regular cycle reports===
Bisq support agents will submit a report each DAO Cycle via the [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64 GitHub roles page].

==Rights==

* Writer access to the &lt;code&gt;Support - Private&lt;/code&gt; Matrix room
* [https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level Triage] access to [[Support Team#Repositories]]

==Policies==

===Time to response===

The goal of the Bisq support agent is to respond to user issues within &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;one hour&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of them being posted. Keep in mind, the goal isn&amp;#x27;t to solve their issue within an hour, but to make initial communication so as to provide the best possible experience.

===Sensitive user data===

Often, support agents need to ask users to share their logs with you or specific information about their offer or trade, such as trade ID, trade amounts, etc. This data should not be shared in any public channel, and it should be securely destroyed one month after the case is closed. Please note that any such information that is shared within the bisq.support subteam is automatically destroyed after 30 days.

==Processes==

===Internship===
Prospective support agents are asked to undergo an internship process, which lasts approximately one month, or one DAO cycle. During this period, you&amp;#x27;ll perform the #Duties|duties of a support agent, but your contributions won&amp;#x27;t be eligible for compensation. This gives you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the role and for all parties involved to assess if a support agent role is a suitable fit for you.

* Indicate your interest in interning as a Support Agent in the #support channel.
# Briefly introduce yourself and share why you&amp;#x27;re interested in this work.
# Let us know your availability for this work.

The Support Team will then:

* Add you to the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/intern-support-agents @bisq-network/intern-support-agents] on GitHub.
* Announce your internship:
# With a message to the larger @bisq-network/support team.
# And with a message in the #support channel.

After successfully completing one full cycle of interning:

* Submit a [[Proposals|proposal]] to be added to the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/support @bisq-network/support] team.
* If your proposal is approved, the support team lead will proceed with your promotion according to the established process.

===Reporting===
Bisq support agents are required to submit a report each DAO cycle that chronicles the support issues that they assisted users with during that cycle.  Reports will be submitted to the [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64 GitHub roles page].

===Compensation===
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Compensation Rates for L1 Support Agents&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Established at 600 USD per cycle.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Eligibility&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Requires working at least 10 hours per week.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Consistency&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: A fixed rate for all Support Agents.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Bonuses&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: May apply upon appropriate justification.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Increases&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: Agreed through consensus by the Support Team.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Switching to a new data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can help you start with Bisq anew: fresh wallet, new onion address, new keys, etc. It&amp;#x27;s a sort of &amp;quot;factory reset&amp;quot; that makes it like you&amp;#x27;re starting Bisq for the first time.

Upon creating a new data directory, you can restore various parts of a previous data directory (e.g., aged and signed payment accounts).

If you instead wish to only obtain a new wallet, while preserving every other element of your data directory, you can [[Create_a_new_wallet_for_your_data_directory|create a fresh wallet in the same data directory]].

__TOC__

= Why switch to a new data directory? =

It&amp;#x27;s a good idea to switch to a new data directory every so often. 
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Performance&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Bisq uses bitcoinj, an SPV library that is not built for high performance, so wallets get increasingly large with every transaction. Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Stability&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Privacy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see [[local reputation]]).

In addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around [[Troubleshooting_wallet_issues|unusual wallet corruption issues]].

= Make sure you&amp;#x27;re ready to switch =

=== Ensure your existing data directory is backed up ===

[[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_the_entire_Bisq_data_directory|See how here]]. Be sure to also do a [[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_payment_accounts|payment account export]] to make importing payment accounts easier.

=== Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes ===

This is paramount because &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you don&amp;#x27;t want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.

= Send funds =

You will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow. 

There are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.

# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Send Funds&lt;/code&gt;, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you&amp;#x27;ve created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt;).
#* Variation: Use the [[Emergency_wallet|Emergency Wallet Tool]] (&lt;code&gt;Cmd/Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn&amp;#x27;t working.
# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you&amp;#x27;ve created it. This method is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See [[Restoring_your_wallet_from_seed#Restoring_to_a_non-Bisq_wallet|derivation path and other details here]].
# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).
## Start Bisq. 
## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the &lt;code&gt;appName&lt;/code&gt; option. See [[Running_from_the_command_line|how to run Bisq from the command line here]].
##* macOS example command: &lt;code&gt;/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new&lt;/code&gt;
##* Name of the new directory doesn&amp;#x27;t matter. &lt;code&gt;Bisq-new&lt;/code&gt; was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it&amp;#x27;s just a temporary placeholder. You&amp;#x27;ll be changing it back to &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; anyway.
## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.
## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.

= Create new data directory =

If you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:
# Close Bisq.
# Delete (or rename) the &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; data directory (see [[Data_directory#Operating_system_defaults|default locations for your operating system here]]).
# Start Bisq again. Bisq will create a new data directory with a new wallet, new Tor state, etc.
# Send funds from external wallet into Bisq.

If you used method 3 in the previous step: 
# Make sure &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq instances are closed.
# Delete (or rename) the original &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; data directory.
# Rename the newer data directory to &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;.
# Start Bisq normally. Your balance should reflect the BTC you sent to it previously.

= Migrate data from backup =

If you&amp;#x27;d like to restore payment accounts and/or your onion address (e.g., [[local reputation]]), [[Restoring_application_data|see how in this article]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Manually select seednodes</title><ns>0</ns><id>544</id><revision><id>3648</id><timestamp>2024-06-22T08:18:18Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Resyncing the SPV file&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can solve wallet issues such as incorrect balance showing, missing transactions, etc.

__TOC__

= How to Resync the SPV File =

It is best to initiate an SPV resync from within Bisq. Sometimes this isn&amp;#x27;t possible, so we include directions on how to initiative an SPV resync from your file system too.

== From the Bisq interface ==

Go to &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Network Info&lt;/code&gt; and click &lt;code&gt;Delete SPV File and Resync&lt;/code&gt;. Bisq will prompt you to restart twice, and depending on the age of your wallet and how many transactions it has, it may take a while to finish syncing. It is normal for your machine to reach high CPU usage levels, and Bisq may not be responsive until syncing has finished.

[[File:Resync-spv-file.png|600px|thumb|left|Where to initiate an SPV resync from within the Bisq interface.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== From the file system ==

Close Bisq, delete the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/wallet/bisq.spvchain&lt;/code&gt; from your [[Data_directory|data directory]], start Bisq, wait for it to load, and then &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;restart Bisq again&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Bisq will not prompt you to restart it again—so don&amp;#x27;t forget to actually do it!

Depending on the age of your wallet and how many transactions it has, it may take a while to finish syncing. During syncing, it&amp;#x27;s normal for your machine to reach high CPU usage levels, and Bisq may not be responsive until syncing has finished.

== Fix an incomplete SPV resync ==
If the SPV resync hangs, and you have no choice other than restarting Bisq, only to find out the resync starts again from scratch, then, while Bisq is closed, delete the &lt;code&gt;resyncSpv&lt;/code&gt; file in the root folder of your [[Data_directory#Default_locations|data directory]] and try again, Bisq should pick up from where it left off at the previous attempt. Important to note is that, after you do this, the UI will load before the SPV resync has finished, so the total amount of funds will not be correctly displayed until the block rescan is complete (you can repeat the previous procedure more than once if needed, so the resync can complete in several parts).

Bisq is known to be a resource-hungry application, so some users may want to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;reduce memory usage&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

__TOC__

{{Run_with_Java_options|&lt;nowiki&gt;-XX:MaxRAM=4g&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Reduce Bisq&amp;#x27;s memory usage by setting a ceiling of 4GB}}

== Persistent setting and Windows work-around ==

If you&amp;#x27;d rather not specify the RAM parameter every time you start Bisq, you can specify it in &lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt; so it automatically takes effect every time.

First, make sure Bisq is closed.

Your &lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file is in the directory with your Bisq binary (this is different from your [[Data_directory|data directory location]]). See [[Running from the command line|locations for each OS here]].

Navigate to the directory with your Bisq binary. Using Windows as an example, this would be &lt;code&gt;$home\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt; should be in the &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; directory.

Open that file in a text editor. Look for the &lt;code&gt;[JavaOptions]&lt;/code&gt; section, and a line in that section that look something like &lt;code&gt;java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=8g&lt;/code&gt;. Change it to &lt;code&gt;java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=4g&lt;/code&gt;, or add it if it&amp;#x27;s not already there.

 [JavaOptions]
 java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=4g

You can also try disabling the hardware graphics acceleration by adding the following line at the end of the &lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt;

 [JVMOptions]
 -Dprism.order=sw

Save the file, close it, and then open Bisq.</text></revision></page><page><title>Linux memory arenas</title><ns>0</ns><id>152</id><revision><id>1514</id><timestamp>2020-06-18T21:39:44Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

With the intention of improving efficiency of memory access in multi-threaded applications, [https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html glibc] may create more memory regions (known as [https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals#Arenas_and_Heaps arenas]) than necessary. In some cases, multi-threaded java applications allocating few and small objects can trigger creation of one arena for each of those threads, resulting in large growth of the Java process&amp;#x27; resident memory, no matter how well on-heap memory is managed by the application. 

One way to limit arena creation in Bisq is to define the environment variable &lt;code&gt;MALLOC_ARENA_MAX&lt;/code&gt;.  

 export MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4

If not set (default=0), a combination of applications may create as many arenas as the number of CPU cores * 8.

This setting reduced resident memory use by ~300 MB, and reduced virtual memory use by ~3.7 GB on an 8-core machine with 16GB RAM running Ubuntu 18. The trade-off for reducing resident memory use in this way is the added cost of the contention between threads for memory access among fewer arenas, but this was not perceptible during testing and profiling (the major bottlenecks in Bisq performance are related to Tor/P2P network I/O).

There are many sources of information on this and other tunable memory allocation parameters, such as the Linux [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mallopt.3.html mallopt] man page. Additional research and troubleshooting tips are welcome.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Compensation&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is an important element of the [[Decentralized_autonomous_organization|Bisq DAO]] that incentivizes people to contribute to the Bisq software and, over time, enables them to take on a greater stake in its governance.

This article covers the several parties involved in the process of requesting, approving, issuing, and guiding compensation.

__TOC__

== Compensation Maintainer ==

The compensation maintainer oversees the day-to-day process of compensation requests, triages issues, and determines rates. 

See the [[Compensation Maintainer]] article for more details on this role.

== Contributor ==

Contributors are welcome to create compensation requests for work they&amp;#x27;ve done on the Bisq project. See instructions in [[Making_a_compensation_request|this guide]].

If you&amp;#x27;d like to contribute to Bisq but are unsure where to start, check out the [[contributor checklist]].

== Burning Men ==

Any contributor can also act as Burning Man. This is part of Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralized [[Burning Men]] protocol. Contributors to Bisq can choose to burn the BSQ they receive to have a chance of receive bitcoin trade fees paid by traders. The process of burning BSQ also help strengthen the DAO by decreasing the BSQ supply.

== Stakeholder ==

Just as stakeholders may review and vote on any DAO proposal, stakeholders may review and vote on any contributor&amp;#x27;s compensation request. After all, compensation requests are merely another type of DAO proposal. 

No special permissions are needed—a stakeholder can simply add feedback in the form of a comment on a compensation request or an emoji reaction (thumbs-up, thumbs-down, confused face, etc).

There is no obligation for stakeholders to perform these reviews, but it&amp;#x27;s advised to only review compensation requests that you are knowledgeable about.

Once you&amp;#x27;ve done some work on the Bisq project, you may want to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;make a compensation request&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; for BSQ.

__TOC__

== Preliminary considerations ==

=== Conventions ===

Compensation requests are generally made for work done in the current DAO cycle—work delivered after the last proposal phase and before the end of the current one—but you can make a request for work done any time in the past as long as you have records of it.

Keep in mind that compensation requests will need to garner a simple majority approval in DAO voting, and before that, team leads will do an initial review of your request. For this to go well, you won&amp;#x27;t want your compensation request to be the first interaction you have with other Bisq contributors. 

Ideally, you will have already had conversations with team leads and other contributors to:
* make them aware of what you want to do
* get others&amp;#x27; feedback on your plans
* get an idea of how valuable your contribution is to the project(so your compensation request is reasonable to you &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to stakeholders)
** don&amp;#x27;t hesitate to suggest a ballpark cost before getting started, if one is not already suggested by other contributors; this helps avoid surprises and hurt feelings at compensation request time

It would be even better to have public threads (issues, pull requests, other discussion threads) tracking your work, progress, and outcomes to help stakeholders put your compensation request into perspective. This is somewhat intuitive for development-related tasks, but non-development contributors should strongly consider making issues in the appropriate repositories or forums too.

For more guidance on how you can get started contributing to Bisq, check out the [[contributor checklist]].

{{Admonition_Warn|Please try not to nickel-and-dime in your compensation request. Charging top dollar for fly-by-night code reviews and minor text corrections are usually seen as red flags, and will probably not be received very well by reviewers and voters.}}

=== Eligible work ===

Compensation requests can only be made for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;delivered work&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;: work that has been available to users at the time compensation for it is being requested (see [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/19 a more elaborate explanation of this notion here]). Work that’s planned or in-progress is not eligible for compensation. 

Generally, work merged to the master branch of a repository can be considered delivered (if applicable).

Reporting bugs and/or opening issues generally does not qualify as delivered work since, strictly speaking, opening an issue does not usually &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;deliver&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; anything. With that said, there are occasional exceptions to this, so as suggested above, please keep other contributors informed about what you&amp;#x27;re up to in order to minimize misunderstandings.

== Create your compensation request ==

Making a compensation request requires 2 steps:
# opening an issue on GitHub 
# submitting the compensation request to the Bisq DAO

Issuance and voting takes place on Bisq, but metadata (e.g. compensation request details) is stored on GitHub to decrease the data storage burden on the Bisq and Bitcoin networks.

If you wish to request compensation for the current cycle, please make a compensation request issue no later than one week prior to the end of the current cycle&amp;#x27;s proposal phase. This allows time for team leads to do an initial review and offer feedback. Reminders about this deadline are sent in the [[https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions|discussions area on GitHub]] and on [[https://bisq.chat|Matrix]] in the #compensation channel.

=== 1. Open a new issue ===

[[File:Github-create-cr.png|400px|thumb|left|Opening a new compensation request issue on GitHub.]]

The issue should go in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues bisq-network/compensation repository], and it should be titled in the following format:

&lt;code&gt;For Cycle N&lt;/code&gt;, where N is the number of the current cycle

You must stick to this convention in order for the compensation request parsing bot to properly parse your request.

{{Admonition_Note|Compensation requests are assumed to be ready for review as soon as they&amp;#x27;re created. If you would prefer to delay review of your request, preface your issue&amp;#x27;s title with &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; so that people (and bots) know to ignore it. Then, when your request is ready for review, just remove &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; from the issue title.}}

=== 2. List your work in the issue ===

Compensation requests must be made in a very particular format in order for them to be valid. This is because a bot is used to parse requests to automatically aggregate work done for reporting and budgeting.

The placeholder text of the issue you just opened tells you everything you need to know.
* In the &amp;quot;Summary&amp;quot; section, fill out all the numbers in brackets (&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;required&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;)
* In the &amp;quot;Contributions Delivered&amp;quot; section, list your contributions as rows in the table (&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;required&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;)
* In the &amp;quot;Contributions in Progress&amp;quot; section, list contributions you&amp;#x27;re expecting to deliver in future cycles

==== Tips on making a convincing request ====

The onus is on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;you&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to convince Bisq stakeholders what you did, how much it’s worth, and why it’s valuable. Voters will be evaluating what you put in this GitHub issue to determine whether or not you should be issued the BSQ you&amp;#x27;re asking for.

In order to make your case as strong as possible, make sure to:
* Include as many links to issues, pull requests, and other &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot; for any work you want to be compensated for
* Comments that help explain what the work is, why it is valuable, etc.
* Links to role reports, if you hold any roles in the Bisq network

As mentioned above, this is a big reason that it’s important that everything you do for Bisq be as public, documented, and verifiable as possible, and that everything you do has positive consensus with multiple stakeholders so you know you’re not wasting your time.

Even then, not all stakeholders will be familiar with your work, so it’s important to be as thorough as you can when making a compensation request so there’s enough context for those unfamiliar with your work to make an informed vote.

Feel free to check out [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed old compensation requests] if you&amp;#x27;re unsure about anything.

==== Tips on valuing your work ====

Valuing work is a judgment call. There&amp;#x27;s no precise way to go about valuing your work, but here are some pointers:
* work should be valued based on the value of the contribution you made, not on the raw time you spent on it
* if you are unsure about the value of your contribution, consider what you would charge for your work if you did it as a freelancer

Ideally, especially if you&amp;#x27;re a new contributor, consider discussing compensation for particular tasks you&amp;#x27;re working on with another contributor who&amp;#x27;s been around longer to see if your expectations align with theirs. You can also browse older requests for examples of what people in the past were paid for similar work.

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Submit your GitHub issue and address feedback ==

Upon submitting your compensation request issue (or removing &lt;code&gt;[WIP]&lt;/code&gt; from the title), a bot will parse it to evaluate formatting. If it&amp;#x27;s not valid, the bot will add a &lt;code&gt;parsed:invalid&lt;/code&gt; label to the issue and leave a comment with a reason. Please edit your issue until the bot adds a &lt;code&gt;parsed:valid&lt;/code&gt; label.

Also shortly after you submit your issue, a human team lead will review it and offer feedback. Upon addressing feedback, the team lead will advise submitting your request to the Bisq DAO.

One exception: if your compensation proposal consists solely of pre-approved roles items for ops, you can skip awaiting feedback from team leads (see https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/ops/discussions/1 for reference).

{{Admonition_Note|[[Compensation#Team_Lead|Team lead reviews]] are not final or binding. But their feedback serves as an important signal to voters, so a favorable indication from them is important.}}

== Submit your request as a DAO proposal ==

Once a team lead has given you the go-ahead, it&amp;#x27;s time to submit your request to the DAO.

In Bisq, go to &lt;code&gt;DAO&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Governance&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Make Proposal&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:Dao-cr.png|600px|thumb|left|Submitting a compensation request to the DAO.]]

# Select &amp;quot;Compensation request&amp;quot; in the dropdown menu
# Specify your GitHub handle, exactly like it is on GitHub
# Replace the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; with the number of your GitHub issue (for example, if your compensation request’s GitHub URL is https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/999, the URL in your DAO compensation request should be https://bisq.network/dao-compensation/999. Don’t copy the GitHub link directly—it won’t work!)
# Specify the amount of BSQ you&amp;#x27;re requesting

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

{{Admonition_Note|Bisq may not use GitHub forever. But the Bitcoin blockchain is forever, and proposal URLs cannot be changed—the Bitcoin transaction corresponding to a Bisq DAO proposal includes a hash of the proposal’s data object, which includes the proposal URL. This is why Bisq proposals require a URL with a domain name that Bisq controls: if proposal data ever needs to be migrated, the links can remain the same.}}

When you’re ready, click &lt;code&gt;Make proposal&lt;/code&gt; to confirm your proposal for voting in the current cycle. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Proposal data cannot be edited, so make sure everything is correct.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=== Fees and other costs ===

A compensation request is a type of proposal, and proposals cost a fee to make in the Bisq DAO. Currently that fee is 2 BSQ. Since a compensation request is intended to issue new BSQ, you’ll also need to include a small amount of bitcoin to be colored into BSQ if your proposal is accepted—100 satoshis × [requested BSQ amount]. See more details in the [[DAO_user_reference#Proposal_Phase|User Reference]]. 

Also remember that Bisq DAO proposals are Bitcoin transactions, so it costs mining fees and takes time for them to be confirmed. Consider watching mining fees to broadcast your proposal at a reasonable cost. Waiting until late in the proposal phase to submit may cause it to not be confirmed in time.

{{Admonition_Note|If you need to make a change, you can delete the proposal and make a new one while the proposal phase is still active, but you’ll need to pay the proposal fee again. Once the proposal phase is over, proposals cannot be added or removed until the next proposal phase.}}

The BSQ and BTC is automatically added to your proposal transaction by Bisq, but the BTC needs to be in your Bisq BTC wallet at the time you submit your proposal. Keep in mind that you’ll also need some BSQ and BTC for the other phases (vote &amp;amp; vote reveal).

When you successfully submit your proposal in the DAO, it’ll propagate across the Bisq peer-to-peer network and be ready for stakeholders to vote on in the voting phase. If your request is approved, you will see the BSQ you requested in your wallet after the voting phase is over.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Submit-generic-proposal.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>387</id><revision><id>2189</id><timestamp>2021-04-23T21:00:34Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

If you&amp;#x27;re interested in contributing to Bisq, ​welcome! This &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;contributor checklist&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; will get you plugged in and productive as quickly as possible.

Bisq is free and open source software, but contributing is not just about writing code. A contributor is any individual who works to improve and add value to the Bisq network and its users.

This can mean anything from fixing typos in documentation, to providing support, to testing out new growth strategies, to implementing new Bisq features and everything in between. All such contributions are eligible for [[compensation]] from the Bisq DAO.

# Familiarize yourself with [https://ossec-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/development/oRFC/orfc-1.html C4: The Collective Code Construction Contract]. It’s a simple set of collaboration rules based on GitHub’s fork+pull request model, and a foundational part of how we work together.
# For more context on C4 and the principles behind it, read author Pieter Hintjens&amp;#x27; short book, [https://www.gitbook.com/?utm_source=legacy&amp;amp;utm_medium=redirect&amp;amp;utm_campaign=close_legacy Social Architecture].
# To understand the fundamentals of Bisq&amp;#x27;s mission and motivations, read the introductory wiki articles on [[Introduction|Bisq]] and the [[Introduction_to_the_DAO|Bisq DAO]].
# To understand Bisq’s commitment to radical transparency and radical honesty, read Part III of [https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021/ Ray Dalio’s Principles].
# To get inspired about what building software in a non-hierarchical organization can be like (and what it requires of everyone involved), read the [https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf Valve Employee Handbook].

== Get connected ==

# Browse and subscribe to the [https://www.youtube.com/c/bisq-network Bisq YouTube channel] to catch up on meetings we hold, tutorials we publish, technical sessions, and more.
# Follow [https://twitter.com/bisq_network @bisq_network] on Twitter, or on any of the other channels listed [https://bisq.network/#community on the bottom of the website]: forum, Telegram, Matrix, Mastodon, etc.
# Subscribe to the [https://lists.bisq.network/listinfo/bisq-contrib bisq-contrib] mailing list for low-frequency, high-priority contributor communications.

If you decide to proceed and start contributing, you&amp;#x27;ll want to join Bisq&amp;#x27;s GitHub organization so you can be assigned to issues:

# Request an invite to the [https://github.com/bisq-network @bisq-network GitHub organization] on Matrix. An admin will get you set up. Doing this makes it possible to add you to the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams @bisq-network/contributors] team and to assign you to GitHub issues.
# After accepting your GitHub invitation, consider changing your [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/people membership visibility] from &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;. This helps others know at a glance roughly how many contributors are involved with Bisq.

== Do valuable work and get compensated ==

After browsing GitHub repositories and Matrix discussions, you will start to develop a sense for what&amp;#x27;s happening, what&amp;#x27;s needed, and where you can help:

# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Find a problem somewhere in Bisq-land&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that (a) needs fixing and (b) is a match for your skills and interests. Browse critical bugs, open bounties, follow chats on Matrix and the forums, and ask around about what other contributors think needs fixing. 
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Get assigned to an issue&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; or have your initiative acknowledged in some other way. While you don’t strictly need anybody’s permission to do anything for Bisq, you’ll want to make sure there&amp;#x27;s buy-in from other contributors so your work is received well. Otherwise, there are no guarantees that your work will be merged, reviewed, or eligible for compensation.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do work to fix that problem&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Submit your fix for review with a pull request (for code and documentation changes) or with a GitHub issue (for everything else).
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Request that others review your work&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. The best way to do this is by writing good commit comments and pull request/issue descriptions that clearly explain the problem your work is intended to solve, why it’s important, and why you fixed it the way you did. Make it as easy as possible for others to review your work. Make it a pleasure for others to review your work.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Incorporate review feedback&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; you get until your fix gets merged or is otherwise accepted.
# &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Repeat&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; steps 1–5.
# [[compensation|Submit a compensation request]] toward the end of the cycle.

{{Admonition Note|As you&amp;#x27;ll see from browsing the various repositories on GitHub, changes to Bisq are almost always discussed publicly. This helps maintain Bisq&amp;#x27;s commitment to transparency, invites feedback to improve the quality of contributions, and it helps keep compensation honest. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Always try to make sure your work is documented somewhere so others can follow its progress and offer feedback.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;}}

Ultimately, please remember that all Bisq contributors participate on a voluntary basis, and the more energy and quality you bring to the table, the more existing contributors will be encouraged to pay you attention.

Regarding development, keep in mind that reviewing other contributors&amp;#x27; work can be highly valuable as well (both to the project, and also to yourself as a way to learn how Bisq works). Quality code reviews are eligible for compensation just like any other contribution.

== Consider if you would like to become a Burning Man ==

For contributors wanting to receive regular bitcoin payments they may consider becoming performing a role as one of the Bisq [[Burning Men]]. It would be worth Bisq contributors understanding the pros and cons to becoming a burning man to decide if it is something they would like to do.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:Github-create-cr.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>450</id><revision><id>2149</id><timestamp>2021-04-10T13:08:37Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

Teams are just a management layer for a select group of Roles.

Contributors can have many roles and therefore many teams.

The Team will have a Leader who will be responsible to granting access to resources the contributor needs, as well as to add a layer of efficiency and trust into the decentralised project.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Roles&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are the way contributors take responsibility for Bisq network resources and processes.

__TOC__

== Background ==

There are many resources and processes vital to the operation of the Bisq Network that require ownership by individual contributors. For example, someone must merge pull requests into the &lt;code&gt;bisq&lt;/code&gt; repository, someone must manage DNS for the &lt;code&gt;bisq.network&lt;/code&gt; domain, a group of people must maintain critical infrastructure such as seed nodes and price nodes, etc.

This document defines the system of roles used within the Bisq DAO to enumerate, define and track each of these responsibilities. The system is designed with two major goals in mind:
# To maximize role owner autonomy in order to achieve Bisq&amp;#x27;s [[Decentralized_autonomous_organization|decentralization goals]]
# To maximize transparency so that DAO stakeholders can effectively review and vote on role owner compensation requests

== Properties ==

The following are properties common to all roles.

=== Duties ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Duties&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are actions that must be performed for a certain resource or process to function normally.

For example, a repository maintainer’s duties include merging pull requests in a timely fashion, and a website operator’s duties include keeping the site available at all times.

=== Rights ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Rights&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are special permissions or other access required to perform the Duties of a role.

For example, a repository maintainer’s rights include write permissions to their repository, and a website operator’s rights include administrative access to site hosting infrastructure.

=== Owners ===

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Owners&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are contributors who have the Rights required to perform the Duties of a role.

One owner is designated as primary and any other owners are designated as [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/12 secondary]. The primary is responsible for performing the Duties of the role, while secondaries stand by, ready to take over for the primary at any time.

== Infrastructure ==

The following infrastructure is used to define and manage each role.

=== Wiki ===

Each role should be documented here on https://bisq.wiki in a document of its own, ideally linked to the larger resource or process it&amp;#x27;s related to.

For example, there is a [[Proposals|proposals wiki article]] covering the concept and process of proposals for users, and a [[Proposals_Maintainer|proposals maintainer article]] covering the role&amp;#x27;s rights, duties, and other details.

Each role’s documentation should specify the role&amp;#x27;s:
* duties
* rights
* GitHub team
* GitHub issue
* bonding requirement (if any)

=== Team ===

Each role has a dedicated GitHub team where each of the role’s Owners are members. The team is used to manage access to GitHub repositories that the role is responsible for and to send notifications to role owners with @mentions in GitHub issues and pull requests.

For example, the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/bisq-maintainers @bisq-network/bisq-maintainers] team has write access to the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq bisq-network/bisq] repository.

{{Admonition_Note|GitHub teams are visible only to GitHub organization members. To join the [https://github.com/bisq-network @bisq-network org], see the [[Contributor_checklist#Get_connected|contributor checklist]].}}

The primary role owner is also assigned as the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;maintainer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of their role’s GitHub team, such that they may manage the team without requiring the intervention of a GitHub admin.

=== Issue ===

Each role has a dedicated GitHub issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues bisq-network/roles] repository, wherein:
* The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Assignees&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; field is used to track role ownership.
* The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Description&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; field is used to link to the role’s wiki article, team, and primary owner.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Comments&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are used for reporting and feedback.

See the [Compensation Maintainer https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/86] role issue for an example.

== Types ==

Most roles fit into one of the types below.

=== Maintainer ===

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Maintainer&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a contributor responsible for enforcing process in a given GitHub repository.

Examples: [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/63 Bisq Maintainer], [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/30 Proposals Maintainer]

==== Maintainer duties ====

* Merging or closing pull requests after sufficient review
* Tagging releases
* Triaging incoming issues and keeping them organized over time

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;A maintainer is not a developer or reviewer.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Submitting and reviewing pull requests is something any contributor can do; neither are maintainer duties per se.

This is particularly important from a [[compensation]] perspective. If you are a maintainer, do NOT group your development and review activities together with your maintainer role in your compensation requests. Rather, account for them separately like any other contributor would.

The goal is to have as many competent contributors developing and reviewing as possible, not to load everything on the maintainer. [https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4/#21-preliminaries C4] is the inspiration here—it’s worth (re-)reading.

==== Maintainer rights ====

* Write access to the repository they are responsible for

=== Operator ===

An &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Operator&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a contributor responsible for keeping a given resource running and functioning normally.

Examples: [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/15 Seednode Operator], [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/19 Forum Operator]

==== Operator duties ====

* Keep the given resource online and functioning normally
* Keep the resource up to date with latest version
* Maintain backups as appropriate
* Report on any incidents

==== Operator rights ====

* Administrative access to hosting infrastructure
* Ownership of any domain name used

=== Administrator ===

An &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Administrator&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (often referred to as &amp;#x27;Admin&amp;#x27;) is a contributor responsible for managing a given resource.

Examples: [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/16 GitHub Admin]

==== Admin duties ====

* Respond to change requests

==== Admin rights ====

* Access to the administrative interface of the resource in question

== Common duties ==

The following duties are common to all roles.

=== Reporting ===

Primary role owners should report once a cycle in the form of a comment [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/13 on their issue]. The report should contain whatever information the role owner believes would be valuable to other users, contributors, and stakeholders. 

The comment should be formatted in Markdown as follows:

 ## Cycle 21 Report
 
 Description and/or list of contributions, accomplishments, or other notable occurrences since the last role report was posted.
 
 /cc bisq-network/compensation#421

The &lt;code&gt;/cc&lt;/code&gt; part should reference the GitHub issue for the contributor&amp;#x27;s compensation request for the cycle corresponding to the role report.

== Bonding ==

Most roles involve special rights that, if abused, could cause damage to the Bisq Network. For this reason, [[Introduction_to_the_DAO#Ensure_honesty_in_high-trust_roles|role owners must put up a bond in BSQ]] [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/state/model/governance/BondedRoleType.java commensurate with the amount of damage that could be caused]. In the event of a role owner turning into a bad actor or being grossly negligent, this bond can be confiscated through a Bisq DAO proposal for confiscating a bond.

== Processes ==

The following are some common roles-related processes.

=== Proposing a new role ===

Typically, proposing a new role is one part of a larger proposal to introduce some new resource or process.

# Discuss the idea informally with other contributors, e.g. via [https://bisq.chat Matrix]
# Follow the [[proposals]] process to formally suggest the new resource or process
# Draft documentation for the new resource or process, including an article about the new role as a wiki article

=== Adding a secondary role owner ===

A primary role owner may add a secondary owner with the following steps:

# Add them as a member of the role’s GitHub Team.
# Add them as an assignee to role’s GitHub Issue.
# Announce the change via a comment on the role’s GitHub Issue.

=== Transferring role ownership ===

A role owner may transfer ownership to another with the following steps:

# Get the new contributor added to the role’s GitHub team.
# Get the old contributor removed from the role&amp;#x27;s GitHub team.
# Have the role’s GitHub issue updated to reflect the new primary owner.
# Announce the change in a comment on the role’s GitHub Issue.</text></revision></page><page><title>Stakeholder</title><ns>0</ns><id>109</id><revision><id>1382</id><timestamp>2020-06-08T08:00:44Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

A &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;stakeholder&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is an owner of [[BSQ]] and therefore capable of participating in Bisq DAO [[governance]].

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Proposals&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are a way to suggest significant &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;project-wide&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; changes or new initiatives where a broad consensus of contributors, users, and stakeholders is desired. Smaller changes to existing components, infrastructure, or processes are generally best discussed in other channels (on Matrix, other GitHub repositories, etc).

This article covers the roles, processes, and conventions for proposals.

__TOC__

== Roles ==

* [[Proposals Maintainer]]

== Processes ==

Anyone may submit new proposals and/or review other proposals. But there are things you can do to make it more likely your ideas are received well.

=== Submission and Review ===

==== Research and Evaluate ====

Proposals are supposed to be significant items with enough weight to draw attention from core contributors, users, and stakeholders from across functions.

{{Admonition_Note|If your idea is focused on a particular area of Bisq, it would be best to first float your idea in the channels for that area. For example, development-related ideas can be discussed in #dev on Matrix or in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq the main GitHub repository]. Growth-related ideas can be discussed in #growth on Matrix or the [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/ growth GitHub repository].}}

Accordingly, proposals should be well-considered, well-researched, and well-articulated.

As a result, before submitting a proposal, please:
# Discuss your idea with other contributors to see if a proposal is worth submitting at all
# Search through existing proposals (both [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues open and closed]) to see whether something similar has already been proposed
# Notice which among those proposals have been accepted and rejected, and why
# Read this article to fully understand the proposal process and guidelines

Look through past proposals that succeeded to get a feel for how they were structured.

==== Create GitHub Issue ====

Once you&amp;#x27;ve done research, floated your idea in the community in other channels, and think your idea might garner broader support, create a new GitHub issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues|bisq-network/proposals repository on GitHub], written and formatted according to the following guidelines:

* Write your proposal in a way that makes it as easy as possible to achieve rough consensus. This means that proposals should be as simple, focused, concrete and well-defined as possible. Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your fellow contributors to understand and agree with you.
* Take full responsibility for your proposal. It is not the maintainers&amp;#x27; job, nor anyone else’s, to see your proposal succeed. If people aren’t responding or reacting to your proposal, it’s your job to solicit that feedback more actively.
* Never assume that anyone other than yourself is going to do the work described in your proposal. If your proposal does place expectations on other contributors, or requires them to change their behavior in any way, be explicit about that.
* Provide context. Make a strong case for your proposal. Link to prior discussions. Do not make your reader do any more work than they have to to understand your proposal.
* Format your proposal well. Make it a pleasure to read.

In general, good proposals take time to research and write. Every minute you spend clearly and logically articulating your proposal is a minute that you save other contributors in understanding it. This diligence on your part will be appreciated and rewarded by others&amp;#x27; attention. 

{{Admonition_Warn|Cheaply-written, &amp;quot;drive by&amp;quot; proposals that waste others&amp;#x27; time will be closed immediately as &lt;code&gt;was:incorrect&lt;/code&gt;.}}

A [[Proposals_maintainer|maintainer]] will quickly review your proposal and will either (a) assign it to you to indicate your ownership and responsibility over it, or (b) close it and label it as &lt;code&gt;was:incorrect&lt;/code&gt; if it does not follow the guidelines listed above.

==== Review ====

Once a proposal is submitted, a two-week review period follows. 

During this period, interested reviewers should read, discuss and ultimately [https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments react] to the proposal as follows:
* 👍: I agree with the proposal and want to see it enacted.
* 😕: I am uncertain about the proposal and I need more information.
* 👎: I disagree with the proposal and do not want to see it enacted.

Try to provide an explanation of your reaction, especially when reacting with a 😕 or 👎. If you don’t, then don’t expect your opinion to have much weight or get addressed.

If you do not understand or care about a given proposal, ignore it.

Use comments on the proposal issue to discuss, ask questions, and get clarifications. Take lengthy discussions offline to Matrix or elsewhere and then summarize them back on the issue.

==== Evaluate ====

The proposal review process is all about reaching a rough consensus, meaning that there is a broad agreement that the proposal should be enacted, and that any dissenting opinions have been addressed, though not necessarily fully resolved.

After the two-week review period is over, a maintainer will evaluate reactions to and discussions about the proposal and will close the issue with a comment explaining that it is approved or rejected based on whether a rough consensus was achieved.

Approved proposals will be labeled with &lt;code&gt;was:approved&lt;/code&gt;. Rejected proposals will be labeled with &lt;code&gt;was:rejected&lt;/code&gt;.

If rough consensus has not been achieved, e.g. because discussion is still ongoing, dissenting concerns have not been addressed, or the proposal has turned out to be contentious, the maintainer will indicate that they cannot close the proposal, and that it is up to the submitter to take next steps to move the proposal forward. One option is to [[#Submit_to_the_DAO|submit the proposal to the DAO]] for voting. If the proposal does not move forward after another two weeks, the maintainer will close and label it &lt;code&gt;was:stalled&lt;/code&gt;.

If there have been no or very few reactions to a proposal after the two-week period, the maintainer will close it and label it as &lt;code&gt;was:ignored&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;!-- was:moved--&gt;

==== Enact ====

Assuming your proposal was approved, the next step is to actually enact the changes described in that proposal, perhaps by [[Project_management|creating a project]] or simply getting to work.

=== Submit to the DAO (if needed) ===

Sometimes it is necessary to submit proposals to the DAO for voting:
* DAO parameter changes
* proposal for bonded roles
* contentious proposals for which there is strong interest but no clear consensus

For most general proposals this should not be necessary—general proposals that have clear consensus (or clear lack of consensus) don&amp;#x27;t need to be voted upon in the DAO. In any case, a DAO submission should only be considered after considerable discussion on GitHub so that voters have context and reason to vote one way or another. Do not submit a DAO proposal before such discussion is established.

See [[Participating_in_a_DAO_voting_cycle|how to submit a proposal for DAO voting]].

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Growth Team&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; focuses on increasing trading volume through community engagement and outreach efforts, market-making bounties, the website, blog, and translations across the website and software.

{{Admonition_Warn| The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Growth Team&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is a now retired Bisq team. The below information is kept for prosperity.}}


== Roles ==
* [[Growth Team Lead]]
* [[Community Manager]]
* [[YouTube Admin]]
* [[Payment Method Maintainer]]
* [[Twitter Admin]]
* [[Transifex Admin]]
* [[Website Operator/Maintainer]]

== Infrastructure ==

=== GitHub ===

==== Team ====

[https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/growth @bisq-network/growth]

==== Priorities ====

https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/projects/1

==== Repositories ====

* https://github.com/bisq-network/growth
* https://github.com/bisq-network/website

=== Chat ===

* [[Matrix_bisq.chat|bisq.chat]] [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.growth:bitcoin.kyoto #Growth] channel.

== Processes ==

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Any effort a contributor expects to be compensated for should be run by the growth team lead to ensure it fits cycle priorities and budget. Failure to do so may result in the contribution being rejected, undercompensated, or uncompensated.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

Please see the priorities board linked above for current objectives. 

If you&amp;#x27;re interested in contributing to an existing priority, please:

* Express your interest in the [[Matrix_bisq.chat|bisq.chat]] [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.growth:bitcoin.kyoto #Growth] channel (or on the corresponding GitHub issue)

If you&amp;#x27;re interested in contributing in a way that&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; currently outlined on the priority board, please:

* Start a discussion on Matrix to outline the merits of your proposed task (or open an GitHub issue [[#Repositories|in the appropriate repository]])
* Growth team members will get in touch with you to determine specifics, if warranted

=== Market Making ===

Occasionally, market making bounties are available for specific markets or regions. These bounties are managed in the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/growth growth repository] on GitHub.

Interested market makers should:

# Carefully evaluate the conditions of the bounties they&amp;#x27;re interested in, or propose a new bounty on GitHub or Matrix
# Outline a convincing plan of action to deliver the bounty
# Determine which cycle they would be able to deliver the bounty in

After agreeing on details and covering any lingering concerns, the market maker will be assigned to the issue and is free to begin work.

{{Admonition_Note|Keep in mind that it&amp;#x27;s not necessary to be working on an approved bounty in order to do market making—market making should be a profitable activity on its own.}}

=== Website ===

Any website change should be first proposed as an issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-website bisq-network/bisq-website] GitHub repository or discussed on Matrix in the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.growth:bitcoin.kyoto #Growth] channell. The issue should cover the proposed change and how it aligns to current priorities. Estimated delivery date and cost should be included as well, if the issue creator expects to be the one delivering the proposed change. 

Website maintainer will then review and advise whether or not to implement the proposal.

It&amp;#x27;s highly recommended that the contributor not begin work on the proposed change until reaching agreement on task specifics, compensation, and timeframe with the website maintainer.

=== Translations ===

For more information on how translations work, please see [[Translation]].

{{Admonition_Warn| The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Donation Address Owner&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (sometimes referred to as the &amp;quot;burning man&amp;quot;) is a now retired Bisq role. The Donation address owner controlled the BTC address where BTC trade fees and funds from time-locked payout transactions where sent. The Donation Address Owner role was replaced by the new [[Burning Men|Burning Men Protocol]] that went live in January 2023. As a result of this change the Donation Address Owner is now largely redundant. Rarely bitcoin from trade fees and some delayed payout transactions will go to the donation address owner, these are the result of edge cases and, therefore, the donation address role has now been retired from Bisq.

Please see [[Arbitration|arbitration]] for more details on how the new burning men protocol works with other elements of Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralized dispute resolution process. The below information is kept for prosperity.}}

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Burning Men&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is the name given to Bisq contributors who choose to burn BSQ in order to receive bitcoin from Bisq trading activity: [[Trading_fees|Trade fees]] and Delayed payout transactions. It&amp;#x27;s an evolution of the previous &amp;#x27;[[Donation Address Owner|burning man]]&amp;#x27; role. The change, implemented since January 2023 in this [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 proposal], aimed to increase Bisq&amp;#x27;s decentralization by distributing this role within many contributors. A single burning man could have gone missing, ran away with the BTC before trading them for BSQ and burning these BSQ, or could have been otherwise compromised.&lt;br&gt;
As each burning men burns an undetermined amount of BSQ as a condition to receive a share of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, trust requirements and single points of failure are almost nonexistent.
Please note: The burningmen protocol described here is entirely different from burns made in Bisq 2 for increasing reputation. Burns made in Bisq 2 do not affect the burningmen protocol.

__TOC__

= Contributing as a Burningmen =

== Eligibility ==

There are two ways to contribute as a Burningmen. Since the system is not exempt of trust requirements, burningmen need to have provided value to Bisq in the past:

* Contributors who received compensation for their contributions within the last 24 cycles.
* Contributors who received a BSQ from the DAO genesis transaction.

After burning some BSQ (it does not matter if they were previously earned or bought in the BSQ market) they will get a share percentage in the distribution of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions. The more value they&amp;#x27;ve provided to Bisq, the bigger the portion of BSQ they are allowed to burn.

== Considerations before burning BSQ ==

Burningmen seek profit from burning BSQ, otherwise they would keep their BSQ or sell them for BTC at the market. But profit, coming from estimating the amount of BSQ to burn now to receive a share of future Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, is not granted. There are many sources of uncertainty:
* Trading volume: affected by BTC trend, Bisq competitors, mining fees, etc.
* Changes to trade protocol: traders could burn more or less BSQ directly, Delayed payout transactions could be reduced considerably.
* BSQ/BTC price volatility.
* BSQ burnt by competing Burningmen. 

Since the launch of the Burningmen protocol up to the moment of this writing (Cycle 61), more bitcoin has been distributed to the Burningmen than the bitcoin equivalent amount of BSQ that has been burnt. This means that, historically, burning BSQ has been profitable for most contributors. &lt;br&gt;
Although Bisq provides an estimation of BSQ to burn based in the past, each of the Burningmen should estimate their risk/reward scenarios based in their predictions. Becoming a Burningmen is optional. Depending on how they value the BSQ they have now, the BTC they can obtain on the future, or even if they just want to help Bisq grow, they will not burn BSQ at all, burn all the BSQ from their compensation requests or even buy more BSQ to burn up to their limit.  &lt;br&gt;
The less competition between Burningmen there is, the more profitable it will be for each of them, and vice versa. The less profitable Burningmen role is, the better for the DAO, as more BSQ is burnt, reducing or containing BSQ supply and therefore pressuring its price up.

= Burning BSQ and receiving BTC =

== Contributors ==

When doing their compensation request, a contributor should fill the &amp;quot;Burningman receiving address&amp;quot; with a BTC address to receive the funds to. Once the compensation request is approved, that address will be used for any burning men payouts they receive up until they ever change it in a subsequent approved compensation request. If that field is never completed, an address from Bisq wallet will be used as receiving address. &lt;br&gt;
It is highly recommended to use an external wallet like electrum or sparrow, which are able to handle many UTXOs and can connect to a signing device for cold storage.

To burn BSQ for the BSQ burning man role the current contributor will see their assigned name &amp;#x27;contributor_name&amp;#x27; in the [[Burning_Men#Burning_Men_Protocol_UI|Burningmen Protocol UI]]. They can then choose to burn an amount of BSQ and press burn. &lt;br&gt;
Since &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Issuance share&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is capped depending on how many BTC were earned in the last 2 years (decaying linearly) it&amp;#x27;s important to make sure that the amount of BTC to burn will not exceed the cap. It would be prudent to begin with small amounts and never exceed the lower amount in the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;burn target&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; column.

== Receivers of the genesis distribution ==

If a contributor has funds from the genesis output(s) in their Bisq wallet they will see their assigned name &amp;#x27;Bisq co founder XX&amp;#x27; in the [[Burning_Men#Burning_Men_Protocol_UI|Burningmen Protocol UI]]. They should chose the BTC address to receive funds and follow the instructions in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390#issuecomment-1306075295 github proposal].

Burning BSQ works as described in the second paragraph at [[Burning_Men#Contributors|contributors]] section.

= Burning Men Protocol UI =

The user interface to interact with the Burning Men User protocol user interface can be found at &lt;code&gt;DAO &gt; Proof of Burn &gt; Burning Men&lt;/code&gt;.

== Burning Men Candidates fields ==

* Contributor name: Always use the same name as per github handle when doing compensation requests to avoid duplicated similar contributors with different names and shares.
* Burn target: Click the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; icon to get more info. Take these numbers as broad estimates and do not use the  one on the right as your cap will be exceeded. Even using the left value could make you reach your cap. Do not make decisions based on what to burn on these numbers alone.
* Receiver share: It informs about the % chance of receiving a trade fee and % amount of the delayed payout transactions you&amp;#x27;ll receive. It&amp;#x27;s updated every block and changes based on who burns BSQ &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; the decay over time of the burns made by the burningmen. Each BSQ burnt amount decays linearly to zero over 12 months. To protect the DAO from an attack from a malicious contributor who self trades sending their trades to arbitration, the maximum share each contributor can get is 11%, no matter how many BSQ they burn.
* Issuance share: It&amp;#x27;s the amount of BSQ compensation each contributor has received over the last 24 cycles, decaying linearly. Recent contributions have a higher weight. It bears maximum receiver share. A burning man can get a receiver share of up to 10 times their issuance share amount, up to a maximum of 11%. A 0.7% percent issuance share will limit the receiver share to 7%.
* Burned amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by contributor over time
* Decayed burn amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by the contributor when taking into account the decay their burns have over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the &amp;#x27;receiver share&amp;#x27; value and changes every block.
* Issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor over time.
* Decayed issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor when taking into account the decay over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the &amp;#x27;issuance share&amp;#x27; value.

== Profit fields==

When selecting a burningmen, individual profit stats are displayed. It can be filtered by burning, trading fee and/or DPT eventsand by month or individual events. Looking at monthly profits can be used as an indicator of how many BSQ to burn. Note that it&amp;#x27;s normal to have a negative profit at the beginning, since receiver shares decay linearly over 12 cycles. A burning man should not expect to regain in one month what will be distributed during a longer period. &lt;br&gt;
Scrolling down at the _Profit_ table, it&amp;#x27;s possible to export all burningman data from a contributor by clicking &lt;code&gt;export to CSV&lt;/code&gt;.

== DAO fields ==
It gives an overview of BSQ burning and bitcoin distribution across all DAO contributors.

* Total amount of burned BSQ: All time amount of BSQ that has been burnt by all contributors acting as burning men.
* Total amount of distributed BTC/BSQ: All time amount of bitcoin that has been distributed to all contributors acting as burning men. For ease of comparison this figure is also given as a BSQ amount.
* Export to CSV: To see the results by month rather than all time in a CSV file, getting a more granular data.

If the amount of BSQ being distributed is greater than the amount being burnt then the burning men are generally in profit from their activities. If the amount of BSQ being distributed is less than the amount being burnt then the burning men are in a loss from their activities.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:See-offer-details.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>253</id><revision><id>1218</id><timestamp>2020-05-12T18:26:24Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

The &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; is where all of Bisq&amp;#x27;s data files are stored.

It is crucial that you [[Backing_up_application_data|back up this directory]] regularly.

__TOC__

= Data directory structure =

Notable items in the data directory:

* &lt;code&gt;bisq.log&lt;/code&gt; - main log file with most recent logs, often helpful for debugging. This file may contain private information, so it&amp;#x27;s usually not wise to post the whole thing publicly.
* &lt;code&gt;bisq.properties&lt;/code&gt; - place to store [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/common/src/main/java/bisq/common/config/Config.java#L57 command-line options], so you don&amp;#x27;t have to specify them every time you run Bisq (where each option is on a new line in &lt;code&gt;&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&lt;/code&gt; format, e.g., &lt;code&gt;dumpStatistics=true&lt;/code&gt;).
* &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/&lt;/code&gt; - main data directory.
** &lt;code&gt;keys/&lt;/code&gt; - keys for signing P2P messages as well as signing and aging payment accounts.
** &lt;code&gt;db/&lt;/code&gt; - various user data and network data. It is strongly discouraged to edit any files in this directory.
** &lt;code&gt;tor/&lt;/code&gt; - Tor state data. The &lt;code&gt;hiddenservice/&lt;/code&gt; folder within determines your onion address.
** &lt;code&gt;wallet/&lt;/code&gt; - BTC and BSQ wallet files and rolling backups, as well as the &lt;code&gt;bisq.spvchain&lt;/code&gt; file.

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

When you just need a fresh new wallet, but wish to keep everything else (accounts, signing status, onion address, trade history, notifications app association, and other custom settings), it is easier and faster to only generate a new wallet for Bisq, rather than [[switching to a new data directory]].

__TOC__

= Why creating a new wallet? =

Being a project built in Java, Bisq uses [https://bitcoinj.org/ bitcoinj], which is a Java library to manage a bitcoin wallet, among other things. This comes with some known limitations, among which is the heavy performance hit when the wallet is old, and contains many transactions, this being especially aggravating when a user needs to do a [[Resyncing_SPV_file|SPV resync]], as it will take a significant amount of time during which the PC will suffer from high load. With old-time and very active traders, who have many past transactions built up in their wallet, this is even more at risk of happening, and causes a forced interruption in trading, as SPV resync must be completed before the application can resume its operativity.

Recreating a completely new Bisq wallet will eliminate the issue, at least for the near future ([[Installing_your_own_Bitcoin_node|running your personal Bitcoin node]] also helps a lot with stability), at the same time preserving all the accrued reputation of your payment accounts, your full trading history, and your existing onion address, by which your previous trading peers will be able to recognize you.

= Preparations =

Make sure the following checklist is observed:
* No existing open offers (delete them -this will make you lose the fees- or wait until they are taken, and their respective trades are completed).
* No existing open trades (wait until they are completed).
* No existing disputes (wait until their resolution).
* Consistent wallet state (go to Funds &gt; Send Funds, and for each btc address containing funds, verify its balance actually exists by searching the address on [https://mempool.space mempool.space], otherwise do a [[Resyncing_SPV_file|SPV resync]] and repeat).

= Caveats =

The provided instructions are safe as long as you don&amp;#x27;t make mistakes, which could amount to:

* Deleting a folder instead of renaming it.
* Using a wrong address to send funds to.
The above mistakes can easily lead to loss of funds, which we obviously are not liable for.

= Instructions =

If the above requirements are met, and you understood the caveats, assuming you have BTC (and probably BSQ as well) in your old wallet, you can follow the procedure outlined below:

# Close Bisq.
# Rename the [[Data_directory#Default_locations|data directory]] from &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Bisq.old&lt;/code&gt;. Copy this file to an external device, it will be used as a backup in case of data loss.
# Start Bisq.
# A new Bisq instance called Bisq will be created (including a new wallet, which is the one we will soon be using to replace the old one).
# Go to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Wallet seed&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and write down the seed of the new wallet. Set the password for the wallet at &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Wallet password&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
# Go to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Funds&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Receive Funds&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and copy the first btc receive address, pasting it into a separate text file for later use.
# Go to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;DAO&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ Wallet&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Receive&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and copy the BSQ receive address of the new wallet, pasting it into your notes.
# Close Bisq.
# Rename the newly created data directory, from &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Bisq.new&lt;/code&gt;, and rename the previous directory from &lt;code&gt;Bisq.old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;.
# Start Bisq
# You will be back into your old Bisq instance
# Go to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;DAO&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ Wallet&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Send&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and send all your BSQ balance to the BSQ receive address of the new wallet (this needs to be done first! if you moved out all of your BTC now, there would be none left to pay for the mining fees to move the BSQ!)
# Go to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Funds&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Send Funds&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and move all your BTC balance to the BTC receive address of the new wallet.
# Close Bisq
# Within the data directory, navigate to the contents of &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt; and rename the &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; folder to &lt;code&gt;wallet.old&lt;/code&gt;.
# Copy the &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; folder from the same location in &lt;code&gt;Bisq.new&lt;/code&gt;, into the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt; folder of the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; data directory, so that now there will be &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wallet.old&lt;/code&gt; folders under &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt;.
# Start Bisq, wait until wallet is synchronized with the blockchain, and verify that all your funds were correctly moved, checking the contents of &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Funds&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Send Funds&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;DAO&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; &gt; &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;BSQ Wallet&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.
# You can now operate normally with Bisq. The brand new wallet will be used instead of the old one.

= Create a new wallet when the old one is empty =

If you wish to switch to a brand new wallet, and there are no funds (anymore) in the previous one, the procedure is much simpler:
# Close Bisq.
# Navigate to your [[Data_directory#Default_locations|data directory]] and into the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet&lt;/code&gt; folder.
# Rename the &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt; folder to &lt;code&gt;wallet.old&lt;/code&gt;.
# Start Bisq, notice a new wallet was created, write down the new seed and set the password.

= Disaster recovery =

In case you made some mistakes along the way and things don&amp;#x27;t work as they should, and provided you never deleted anything, but rather renamed the folders as suggested above, you can go back to the starting point by simply making sure, after closing Bisq, that the data directory gets back to its original state, that is, &lt;code&gt;Bisq.old&lt;/code&gt; is renamed to &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;, and, if you got to that point, &lt;code&gt;wallet.old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;wallet&lt;/code&gt;.

Having a copy of &lt;code&gt;wallet.old&lt;/code&gt; at an external device (like a usb memory) is also recommended, in case of the unlikely event of permanent data loss.

= Cleanup =

Only after you are absolutely sure everything is in order, and if you need to free up as much disk space as possible, you can delete the &lt;code&gt;Bisq.new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wallet.old&lt;/code&gt; folders.</text></revision></page><page><title>Troubleshooting wallet issues</title><ns>0</ns><id>284</id><revision><id>3422</id><timestamp>2023-11-17T17:36:40Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

This article covers some tactics for &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;troubleshooting wallet issues&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to address incorrect balance showing, missing transactions, and other strange inconsistencies.

__TOC__

= Re-sync SPV chain =

The SPV file is a collection of data from the Bitcoin blockchain that tells Bisq your wallet’s balances. All data in the file is available on the Bitcoin network. Resyncing this file just forces Bisq to resync with the Bitcoin network and fetch the data it needs to determine your wallet state again.

See how to initiate an SPV resync [[Resyncing_SPV_file|here]].

= Restore a wallet backup =

If issues persist, you can try to restore a wallet backup file from the &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/wallet/backup/backups_bisq_BTC_wallet/&lt;/code&gt; folder of your [[Data_directory|data directory]].

This folder holds your most recent wallet backups made on a rolling basis. Replace the &lt;code&gt;bisq_BTC.wallet&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;btc_mainnet/wallet/&lt;/code&gt; with a recent wallet backup file and rename it to &lt;code&gt;bisq_BTC.wallet&lt;/code&gt;. You will also need to resync the SPV chain when restoring a backup, so be sure to also delete &lt;code&gt;bisq.spvchain&lt;/code&gt;.

Start Bisq and see if your issue is fixed. If not, repeat with another wallet backup file.

= Switch to a new data directory =

If neither re-syncing the SPV chain nor restoring a wallet backup solves the issue, you might have a corrupted wallet. 

In this case, it’s best to [[Create_a_new_wallet_for_your_data_directory|create a new wallet]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Emergency wallet</title><ns>0</ns><id>433</id><revision><id>2754</id><timestamp>2022-01-22T19:06:54Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

== Warning ==
Ask for help on [[User_support#Via_Matrix_bisq.chat|Matrix]] to make sure this is the best solution to your issue. Use under your own risk.

== Backup ==

Make a [[Backing up application data|backup]] of your Bisq data before using the emergency wallet.

== Emergency wallet ==

This tool allows you to send all funds to a BTC or BSQ address. It should be used only when Bisq wallet is corrupted.
You can access to external wallet through shortkey &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x27;Ctrl + e&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;alt + e&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;cmd + e&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt; for BTC, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x27;Ctrl + b&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;alt + b&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;cmd + b&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt; for BSQ.

[[File:Emergency Wallet.png|left]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Restore wallet from seed ==

If the emergency wallet tool produces a transaction that fails to broadcast (you can see that at &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Funds &gt; Transactions&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;) you can import private keys to a [[Switching_to_a_new_data_directory|new Bisq instance]] at &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Accounts &gt; Wallet Seed - Restore wallet from seed&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. 
Importing seeds to an external wallet should be used only if this method fails, and is extremely recommended to report it to support.</text></revision></page><page><title>Domestic Wire Transfer</title><ns>0</ns><id>496</id><revision><id>3911</id><timestamp>2025-02-12T02:15:54Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Sometimes trades on Bisq fail because of bugs or edge situations, that lead to an invalid deposit transaction: either no deposit txid exists, or the txid is missing from the blockchain (as can be verified on a blockchain explorer).

Usually failed trades will also have an issue with the maker and/or taker txid, caused by an out-of-sync internal Bisq wallet on the party with the failed tx.
* if miner and trade fees were lost for the BTC buyer and/or seller, a reimbursement can be considered if the lost fees are significant enough, e.g. above $10 of value
* if no fees were lost, no reimbursement is obviously needed
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;no other losses will be caused by a failed trade&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, as the deposit tx never happens, so no additional funds will have left your wallet in the first place

__TOC__

== Common reasons for trades to fail ==

The most common reason for a trade to fail is either the maker or taker is trading with an out-of-sync bitcoin wallet.

When the maker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet they will often be able to &amp;#x27;make&amp;#x27; a trade of their choosing. Normally one of two things happen:
# 1. When the maker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet most often the trade will end up not being displayed on the Bisq Markets for someone to take as the software checks to make sure an offer is valid before propagating it to the peer to peer network. When a trade fails in this way the maker will not have lost any trade fees or miner fees as there was never any maker transaction ID. In this instance the fix is for the maker of the trade to do an [[Resyncing SPV file|SPV resync]]. Once this is completed they can delete the trade they made by goin to Portfolio &gt; Open Offers and pressing the delete icon next to the trade.
# 2. Sometimes an invalid maker offer can be shown in a users Bisq instance. If this happens when the taker takes the offer they will lose both mining and trade fees as they will incur costs for the taker transaction ID even though a deposit transaction will not be created. In this case reimbursement can be considered by the taker if the lost fees are significant enough to warrant making a reimbursement request, eg above $10 of value.). In this instance the fix is for the maker of the trade to do an [[Resyncing SPV file|SPV resync]]. 

When the taker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet they will often be able to &amp;#x27;take&amp;#x27; a trade of their choosing. Normally one of two things happen:
# 1. The trade remains in the offer book, the taker transaction and the deposit transaction fails, the trade can be seen on both the buyer&amp;#x27;s and seller&amp;#x27;s Bisq instance. The deposit transaction confirmation will show as N/A. This is because the deposit transaction could not be created because the taker transaction failed. In this instance neither the maker or taker will have lost any trade or miner fees. The offer will still be able to be taken in the offer book, and the taker transaction did not confirm so no fees were spent from the takers wallet. In this instance the fix is for the taker of the trade to do an [[Resyncing SPV file|SPV resync]]. 
# 2. The trade is removed from the offer book, the taker transaction and the deposit transaction fails, the trade can be seen on both the buyer&amp;#x27;s and seller&amp;#x27;s Bisq instance. The deposit transaction confirmation will show as being present but a check on a blockchain explorer will show it as an invalid transaction. This is because the deposit transaction could not be created because the taker transaction failed. In this instance the maker will have lost trade and miner fees, but the taker will not have lost any fees. In this case reimbursement can be considered by the maker if the lost fees are significant enough to warrant making a reimbursement request, eg above $10 of value.). In this instance the fix is for the taker of the trade to do an [[Resyncing SPV file|SPV resync]]. 

== Less common reasons for trades to fail ==

Less common reasons for trades to fail are:

* Bugs in the software
* Tor network issues
* A user trading with an out of space hard drive, corrupted wallet, or poor connection to the Bisq network

In these cases the maker and taker can check their respective transaction IDs.

* If the maker or taker ID failed then the respective user will not have lost any miner or trade fees.
* If the maker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the maker will not have lost any trade or miner fees IF the deposit transaction shows as N/A
* If the maker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the maker will have lost trade and mine fees IF the deposit transaction shows as being present but is invalid  when checked on the blockchain.
* If the taker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the taker will have lost trade and miner fees if the trade failed.

In instances like the above ideally the trade would end up in mediation and the mediator will request your logs to understand what the issue was that caused the trade to fail and make recommendations for what, if anything, you need to do to avoid future instances of failed trades.

== What failed trades are eligible for reimbursement? ==

Any user that has lost trade and miner fees is eligible for reimbursement.

Trades are also only eligible for reimbursement if submitted within 3 months from the date of the trade.

== When to consider reimbursement? ==

It is important to remember no trade or deposit funds are lost with failed trades. Most of the time if you see your Bisq wallet is missing funds from a failed trade it means your wallet it out-of-sync, which is why the trade failed!  Do an [[Resyncing SPV file|SPV resync]] to fix the issue and your wallet will show the correct balance.

Reimbursement of a filed trade requires some work to do in gathering the information and posting it online, it also have some privacy implications as you are having to post maker, taker, and deposit transaction IDs. As a result of this it is often not making reimbursement requests for MOST failed trades as miner and trade fees are usually small (less than a few dollars, local currency equivalent, of value). Therefore, it is recommended traders ONLY request reimbursement for trades where they feel their trade fee and miner fee losses are significant enough to warrant the time to do so. Most of the time this will be for takers with lost trade fees where the trade that failed was a large amount of BTC. For example the maximum trade fee loss on a 1 BTC trade would be 0.0044 BTC. This would be worth requesting reimbursement for.

== What should I do before requesting reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees? ==

Before requesting reimbursement for a filed trade you should make sure you are eligible for reimbursement ie you have lost both trade fees and miner fees.

You should also be aware of what miner fees and reimbursement fees you have lost on the trade. This is important as it means traders are aware of what fees they are claiming before they make a reimbursement request and prevents any misunderstanding of users with failed trades assuming they have lost the trade or deposit amounts when that is not the case, and in most cases can be quickly solved with an [[Resyncing_SPV_file|SPV Resync]].

==== How do I know what my miner fees were? ====

Please also make sure you know how much miner fees you lost for a trade. This can be checked on blockchain explorer. 

[[File:Miner fees.png|thumb|center|This shows where you can find your miner fees on a blockchain explorer such as mempool.space]]

==== How do I know what my trader fees were? ====

Please also make sure you know how much trade fees you lost for a trade. This will be a percentage of the trade amount and differs depending on whether you were the maker or taker or chose BTC or BSQ to pay the trade fees.

* BTC trade fees are 0.15% of the trade amount for the maker and 1.15% of the trade amount for the taker.
* BSQ trade fees are 0.075% of the trade amount for the  maker and 0.575% of the trade amount for the taker.

You can check the latest trading fees [[Trading_fees|here]].

You can verify your BTC fees on any blockchain explorer.

You can verify your BSQ fees on a BSQ explorer such as https://bisq.markets/ or https://bisq.mempool.emzy.de/

== How to make reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees from a failed trade? ==

You can make a reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees from a failed trade by creating a new issue on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues Bisq GitHub Support repository].

You will need a GitHub account, to maintain privacy feel free to create on just for the purpose of the reimbursement. There is a [https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=&amp;amp;template=reimbursement-template.md&amp;amp;title=Fee+reimbursement+for+trade+XXXXX template here]* that you should follow to create your reimbursement request.

*This link will only work when you are logged into a GitHub account.

Once your issue is posted a support agent might ask you some more questions if they need any extra info to what you have provided.

If your request is a valid one for reimbursement then the [https://bisq.wiki/Fee_Reimbursement_Agent Fee Reimbursement Agent] will add you to their list of reimbursement cases to payout. They usually process reimbursements every 4-8 weeks in batches so please be prepared to wait a little time before reimbursement. You can follow the process on the issue you created to see the status of your reimbursement.</text></revision></page><page><title>File:View-mediator-suggestion.png</title><ns>6</ns><id>263</id><revision><id>1250</id><timestamp>2020-05-29T21:12:49Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

Here is a list of current Bisq mediators and their onion addresses, as well as how you can find the mediator for a specific Bisq trade.

__TOC__

= Get in touch with your mediator =

For open trades, you should be able to get in touch with your mediator through Bisq mediation chat itself.

If you cannot get in touch with your mediator on Bisq for 48 hours (sometimes Bisq message system fails), or the issue needs urgent attention, you can get in touch with them on the [[Matrix bisq.chat]] group.  Their Matrix handles and onion addresses are displayed in the headline for the #support channel as well.

= How to find the mediator for a trade =

== In Bisq 1 ==

=== System message ===

Go to &amp;#x27;Support &gt; Mediation&amp;#x27; tab since mediation begins.

[[File:Finding mediator message system.png|400px|thumb|none]]

=== View contract in JSON ===

Alternatively, you can look for your mediator since the trade starts:

# Go to  &lt;code&gt;Portfolio &gt; Open Trades&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Portfolio &gt; History&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Portfolio &gt; Failed Trades&lt;/code&gt; (depending on the status of your trade) 
# Click the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; icon next to the trade ID of the trade in question (it&amp;#x27;s on the very left in the first column)
# In the pop-up that appears, toward the bottom, click &lt;code&gt;View Contract in JSON Format&lt;/code&gt;.
# Ignore the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;mediatorNodeAddresses&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field, as this is the list of all active mediators when the trade started.
# Scroll down and you&amp;#x27;ll find &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;mediatorNodeAddress&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field with a single &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;hostName&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; for the onion address.

This is the onion address of the mediator for your trade.

== In Bisq 2 ==

=== Bisq Easy ===
The mediator for a Bisq Easy trade can be found by going to the &amp;quot;My Open Trades&amp;quot; tab. Trade details, including the assigned mediator, are displayed for each open trade.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Payment accounts&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; indicate the method by which Bisq trades are to be settled. You must create a national currency account to trade bitcoin for national currencies or an altcoin account to trade altcoins for bitcoin.

__TOC__

== Creating a national currency account == 

Before creating a national currency account, notice that we cannot take any offers. The buttons to take offers are disabled, and if we try to click any of them, Bisq will tell us we need to create a payment account first.

[[File:BuyBitcoinscreen.png|thumb|left|500px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

You can create a new national currency account in &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. Pick the payment account type from the drop-down and fill out the form. For more details on the various payment methods Bisq offers, see [[Payment methods]].

Bisq will ask you for information required to set up the account in Bisq. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Recall that all the information you put in here is stored locally&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, and only sent to your trading peer upon confirmation of the trade&amp;#x27;s deposit transaction. This is a stark contrast to typical exchange KYC, where personal information is stored in a central database honeypot indefinitely for various forms of harassment and surveillance.

{{Admonition_Warn|Make sure all information you put in your payment account is correct, such that it matches what the other trader will see on their bank statement. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Do NOT use fake names or initials.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Doing so is a violation of [[Trading_rules#Do_not_confirm_payments_with_mismatching_details|trading rules]].

Also: once you’ve created an account, you cannot edit its details (if you need to make a change, you’ll have to delete and add the account again). So make sure everything is correct the first time!}}

[[File:Accountsetup.png|thumb|left|500px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

You don’t need to edit the Salt field. Account name is a label you can set to make it easier to distinguish between other payment accounts you set up; only you will ever see, so there’s no right or wrong value for it.

Once you&amp;#x27;re done, click &lt;code&gt;Save New Account&lt;/code&gt;. Go back to the &lt;code&gt;Buy BTC&lt;/code&gt; screen and you&amp;#x27;ll see that offers requiring the payment method you just configured will now be enabled:

[[File:BuyBTC-accountenabled.png|thumb|left|500px]]

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

=== Notes ===

If there are no offers in the payment method you prefer, don&amp;#x27;t hesitate to make your own offer. New Bisq peers come online all the time, and it only takes 2 to trade. Also, offer makers pay a lot less in fees!

== Creating an altcoin account ==

Creating an altcoin account is largely the same as creating a national currency account, but even simpler. 

Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Altcoin Accounts&lt;/code&gt;, click &lt;code&gt;Add New Account&lt;/code&gt;, pick the altcoin you&amp;#x27;d like to trade in the drop-down, and fill out the form.

=== Special requirements ===

Some altcoins have specific requirements. Monero, for example, requires that sellers be able to provide a transaction key in case of a dispute, which is not available in all XMR wallets. L-BTC buyers must use a wallet that shows the blinding key. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Make sure to read any pop-ups carefully to make sure your trades go as smoothly as possible.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=== Instant accounts ===

By default, all altcoins trades on Bisq have trade periods of 1 day, but you can set up an Altcoins Instant account on Bisq for 1-hour trade periods. Just check the box in the payment account creation process. 

[[File:Altcoin-instant-setup.png|500px|thumb|left|Check this box to set up an Altcoins Instant account.]]

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&lt;languages/&gt;
&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:1--&gt;
Bisq offers several &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;payment methods&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

&lt;!--T:2--&gt;
Every offer on Bisq designates a payment method for traders to settle payments. The Bisq software does not actually integrate with any payment methods—&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;all non-bitcoin fund transfers are made outside of Bisq software&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

&lt;!--T:3--&gt;
Unlike cryptocurrency transfers, many fiat payment transfers are riddled with flaws and limitations that require Bisq to employ special measures to encourage fair and honest trades. One of these measures is lower per-trade limits, which are covered below. Another key measure is [[Account_limits#Account_signing|account signing]].

&lt;!--T:7--&gt;
__TOC__

== Fiat payment methods == &lt;!--T:8--&gt;

&lt;!--T:9--&gt;
The payment methods vary in chargeback risk, regional availability, transaction size, fees, privacy, verifiability, and other characteristics.
The top consideration for maintaining payment methods is chargeback risk. PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App are not supported on Bisq because chargebacks for payments made with those services are relatively easy.

&lt;!--T:10--&gt;
We welcome suggestions for new payment methods on Bisq, especially for those that enable new markets. Documentation on the criteria and process for adding new payment methods is found [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=re%3Apayment-method&amp;amp;template=add_payment_method.md&amp;amp;title= here]. Please also feel free to make suggestions by reaching out on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] in the #payment-methods channel.

&lt;!--T:11--&gt;
Below is a list of fiat payment methods Bisq currently supports.

&lt;!--T:12--&gt;
&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Note: The maximum trade sizes listed below are not available for most newly-created payment accounts. Please refer to [https://bisq.wiki/Account_signing Account signing] for details on how to enable larger trade sizes for your payment accounts. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

=Maintainer=
A Maintainer is a contributor responsible for enforcing process in a given GitHub repository.

Examples: [[Proposals Maintainer]], [[Compensation maintainer]].

==Maintainer Duties==
* Merging or closing pull requests after sufficient review.
* Tagging releases.
* Triaging incoming issues and keeping them organized over time.
** A Maintainer is not a Developer or a Reviewer
** Submitting and reviewing pull requests is something any contributor can do; neither are maintainer duties per se.
** This is particularly important from a [[Compensation]] perspective. If you are a maintainer, do NOT group your development and review activities together with your maintainer role in your compensation requests. Rather, account for them separately like any other contributor would.
** The goal is to have as many competent contributors developing and reviewing as possible, not to load everything on the maintainer. [https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4/#21-preliminaries C4] is the inspiration here, it’s worth (re-)reading.

==Maintainer Rights==
* Write access to the repository they are responsible for.

Matrix is a messaging platform used by Bisq for discussions of all things related to Bisq. It is also the place for Bisq users to access support agents with any questions they might have.

Matrix replaced Keybase as the main Bisq messaging platform around January 2022. If you are still using Keybase it is recommended to move over to Matrix by visiting [https://bisq.chat/ bisq.chat].

== Matrix ==

[http://www.matrix.org Matrix.org] is a secure, decentralized, real-time communication tool [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/355 replacing Keybase], the tool previously used by Bisq prior to 2022. 
Bisq self-hosts [https://bisq.chat/ bisq.chat], a Matrix team server, which takes a step further on the grade of censorship-resistance and privacy.

== Using Matrix ==

=== Web interface ===

Matrix can be used as a web based app. That&amp;#x27;s a big advantage, specially for users only requiring occasional support and who don&amp;#x27;t need to keep on the day to day conversations.
To start using [bisq.chat] just click the link and you&amp;#x27;ll see a page like this:

[[File:Matrix 1.png|400px|thumb|left]] 

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;continue&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and many Matrix clients will be displayed. Select Element, which is one of the most popular and can be used without installing software. Click the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;continue in your browser&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; button and the [https://app.element.io/#/room/#bisq:bitcoin.kyoto web app Element] will load.
Click &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;join&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;create account&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;, as we suppose you don&amp;#x27;t have a matrix account yet. Next image shows fields needed to host the account at matrix.org. There are other hosts requiring different data to join.

[[File:Matrix create account.png|500px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Joining channels ====

Once the matrix.org hosting account has been created, you&amp;#x27;ll see the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.general:bitcoin.kyoto General] and [[User_support|Support]] channel. &lt;/br&gt;
Click on the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;+&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; sign on &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; and then &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Explore rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to join other channels, for example [[getting your first BTC|Get your first BTC]].

[[File:Matrix web main screen.png|500px|thumb|left]]
&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Alternatively, after selecting Bisq space icon in the leftmost column, click on the Bisq dropdown and choose &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Explore rooms&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

[[File:Explore all.jpg|500px|thumb|left]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Installing Element ===

To install Element on your desktop, go to [https://element.io/get-started#download], select your OS and follow the instructions. Check other clients and platforms [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/ here]. &lt;/br&gt;
You can also download and install Element on Android or iOS through their app stores.</text></revision></page><page><title>Informal Market for Small BTC Trades</title><ns>0</ns><id>440</id><revision><id>2737</id><timestamp>2022-01-20T20:46:08Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Mining fees&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; are BTC paid to miners to include a BTC transaction into a block.  
The amount of BTC to be paid depends on a mining fee market driven by the amount of blocks produced by miners and demand for block space, and also the size of the transaction. This price is expressed in sat/vB or satoshis per byte. BTC transactions waiting to be included into a BTC block wait at the mempools of BTC nodes, and only those offering a higher sats/vB to miners will be included for every block. Mempool state can be seen at most blockchain explorers, like [http://www.mempool.space mempool.space].  
Bisq use segwit addresses by default to save space on the blockchain and hence, mining fees.

[[File:Mining fees 1.png|500px|thumb|left]] 
=== Mining fees to trade ===
Required mining fees for trading are estimated by Bisq. Traders can&amp;#x27;t decide how much to pay because underpaying mining fees would cause delays or even make trades fail. Fee rate to be used is fed by seednodes and displayed at the bottom left of the window.  
The total BTC to be paid is displayed before making or taking any offer. As makers only publish a single transaction to create an offer (maker trading fee transaction) and takers have to publish three (taker trading fee, deposit and payout transactions), taking an offer pays approximately 3 times more in mining fees than making an offer. This is because offer makers cannot know what mining fees will be at the time their offer is taken.  
Unlike [[trading fees]], mining fees to pay are independent to the trade amount. A higher trade will relatively pay less mining fees than a small trade.

=== Mining fees to withdraw ===
When sending BTC from Bisq wallet to other BTC addresses, you can use the mining fee recommended by Bisq or set your own at the &lt;code&gt;Funds / Send funds&lt;/code&gt; tab. If you have used very small fees, it could not be included. If you still can find your tx on blockchain explorers but want to accelerate the process, you can try a manual [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/49723/replace-by-fee-vs-child-pays-for-parent CPFP] (Child Pays For Parent) transaction. If the transaction is not anymore on the block explorers, do a [[Resyncing_SPV_file|SPV resync]] to make your wallet &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; that transaction.</text></revision></page><page><title>Security deposit</title><ns>0</ns><id>419</id><revision><id>3817</id><timestamp>2024-12-23T03:45:02Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Security deposits&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in Bisq are BTC funds that buyer and seller lock in a 2of2 multisig address together with trade funds when an offer is taken in order to help ensure that both peers follow the trading protocol. Security deposits are fully reimbursed automatically to both trading peers when the trade ends without [[dispute resolution | disputes]].

Security deposits are the most important tool Bisq offers to protect honest traders. Furthermore, requiring &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; parties to post a deposit increases chances that they will be willing to cooperate and determine amicable outcomes in case a trade doesn&amp;#x27;t go according to plan.

When a trade doesn&amp;#x27;t go the happy path, a portion or the total amount of the offending peer&amp;#x27;s deposit will be lost, depending on whether the trade is concluded in mediation or arbitration. For example, it is considered a protocol violation when the buyer doesn&amp;#x27;t pay the seller as specified in the trade contract (e.g., late payment, mismatching names, wrong payment method, etc). [[Trading_rules|This article]] lists all Bisq trading rules.

== Note for new users ==

Security deposits create a conundrum for new users: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;bitcoin is required to buy bitcoin&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. This can be inconvenient, but it&amp;#x27;s a core part of the security protocol. The initial amount of BTC required to do a trade can vary depending on the payment method, but the bare minimum BTC required to buy more BTC (as of this writing) is 0.002 BTC to cover the minimum security deposit and mining fees. Take a look at [[Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin|this article]] for suggestion on how to get this initial BTC without KYC ([[Bisq Easy]], [[Getting_your_first_BTC|Get your first BTC]] room, a friend, ATM, sell something, work for it, etc).

Why the hard security deposit requirement? Bisq never custodies your funds, and it avoids reputation mechanisms that would weaken your privacy (e.g., reviews: to such reputation data, it must be stored somewhere &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;and&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; tied to an identity). Such mechanisms would only give a false sense of security anyway due to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attacks].

== Recommended amounts ==

Bisq allows offer makers to choose a security deposit percentage: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;minimum is 15%&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of trade amount and &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;maximum is 50%&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of trade amount (absolute minimum is 0.001 BTC). The offer taker must deposit the same amount as the offer maker.

When creating an offer, Bisq recommends a security deposit based on recent volatility of the asset being traded: &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;the higher the volatility, the higher the recommended security deposit&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;. Using the recommended amount helps prevent trades from becoming future trades where the BTC buyer only sends payment to settle the trade if the BTC price has not fallen enough to compensate for losing the security deposit.

{{Admonition_Note|Deposits and trade amounts are locked in the multisignature address to secure trades. So a peer selling 1 BTC who chooses to specify a 25% security deposit when making his offer will need to lock 1.25 BTC, which would require the buyer to lock 0.25 BTC when taking the offer. Ultimately, this means 1.5 BTC will be locked in a 2-of-2 multisig address when the deposit transaction is confirmed, and only at that point can the buyer send payment to the seller.}}

[[File:Security deposit 1.png|500px|thumb|left|Depending on volatility, recommended security deposits can reach 50%.]]
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

When taking an offer, the security deposit set by the maker can be viewed on the &lt;code&gt;Deposit BTC (%)&lt;/code&gt; column. 
[[File:Security deposit 2.png|500px|thumb|left|See required deposit % in this column on the offer book.]]
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== Reduced peer&amp;#x27;s deposit payout during arbitration ==

The latest trade protocol, which introduced contributors as BurningMen, to eliminate the single-point-of-failure that was the legacy BurningMan, implies that the trader winning in arbitration will get a considerably smaller (if at all) portion of the peer&amp;#x27;s deposit as compensation, to account for the risk of malicious BM&amp;#x27;s exploiting the protocol itself.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to minimize the risk of having funds locked in arbitration for a prolonged time without any compensation after the resolution, you should take into account [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/411 this table], and set a deposit % higher than the minimum amount possible, which will yield no compensation whatsoever.</text></revision></page><page><title>Payment methods</title><ns>0</ns><id>133</id><revision><id>3851</id><timestamp>2025-01-24T17:05:09Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;translate&gt;&lt;!--T:1--&gt;
Bisq offers several &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;payment methods&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

&lt;!--T:2--&gt;
Every offer on Bisq designates a payment method for traders to settle payments. The Bisq software does not actually integrate with any payment methods—&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;all non-bitcoin fund transfers are made outside of Bisq software&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

&lt;!--T:3--&gt;
Unlike cryptocurrency transfers, many fiat payment transfers are riddled with flaws and limitations that require Bisq to employ special measures to encourage fair and honest trades. One of these measures is lower per-trade limits, which are covered below. Another key measure is [[Account_limits#Account_signing|account signing]].

&lt;!--T:7--&gt;
__TOC__

== Fiat payment methods == &lt;!--T:8--&gt;

&lt;!--T:9--&gt;
The payment methods vary in chargeback risk, regional availability, transaction size, fees, privacy, verifiability, and other characteristics.
The top consideration for maintaining payment methods is chargeback risk. PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App are not supported on Bisq because chargebacks for payments made with those services are relatively easy.

&lt;!--T:10--&gt;
We welcome suggestions for new payment methods on Bisq, especially for those that enable new markets. Documentation on the criteria and process for adding new payment methods is found [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=re%3Apayment-method&amp;amp;template=add_payment_method.md&amp;amp;title= here]. Please also feel free to make suggestions by reaching out on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] in the #payment-methods channel.

&lt;!--T:11--&gt;
Below is a list of fiat payment methods Bisq currently supports.

&lt;!--T:12--&gt;
&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Note: The maximum trade sizes listed below are not available for most newly-created payment accounts. Please refer to [https://bisq.wiki/Account_signing Account signing] for details on how to enable larger trade sizes for your payment accounts. &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Bisq is known to be a resource-hungry application, so some users may want to &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;reduce memory usage&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

__TOC__

{{Run_with_Java_options|&lt;nowiki&gt;-XX:MaxRAM=4g&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Reduce Bisq&amp;#x27;s memory usage by setting a ceiling of 4GB}}

== Persistent setting and Windows work-around ==

If you&amp;#x27;d rather not specify the RAM parameter every time you start Bisq, you can specify it in &lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt; so it automatically takes effect every time.

First, make sure Bisq is closed.

Your &lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file is in the directory with your Bisq binary (this is different from your [[Data_directory|data directory location]]). See [[Running from the command line|locations for each OS here]].

Navigate to the directory with your Bisq binary. Using Windows as an example, this would be &lt;code&gt;$home\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt; should be in the &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; directory.

Open that file in a text editor. Look for the &lt;code&gt;[JavaOptions]&lt;/code&gt; section, and a line in that section that look something like &lt;code&gt;java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=8g&lt;/code&gt;. Change it to &lt;code&gt;java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=4g&lt;/code&gt;, or add it if it&amp;#x27;s not already there.

 [JavaOptions]
 java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=4g

You can also try disabling the hardware graphics acceleration by adding the following line at the end of the &lt;code&gt;Bisq.cfg&lt;/code&gt;

 [JVMOptions]
 -Dprism.order=sw

Save the file, close it, and then open Bisq.</text></revision></page><page><title>Running on HiDPI screen</title><ns>0</ns><id>415</id><revision><id>2231</id><timestamp>2021-04-28T23:02:18Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Running Bisq on a HiDPI screen&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (2k, 4k, etc) with default settings often leads to small text.

This article covers how to fix this issue on Linux.

__TOC__

{{Run_with_Java_options|&lt;nowiki&gt;-Dglass.gtk.uiScale=1.4&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Adjust scaling with the following prefix}}</text></revision></page><page><title>Connecting to your own Bitcoin node</title><ns>0</ns><id>389</id><revision><id>3905</id><timestamp>2025-02-06T14:28:20Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Bisq will &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;connect to [[Installing_your_own_Bitcoin_node|your local Bitcoin node]]&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; if it finds it upon starting up. This article contains the requirements for this to work correctly.

You can also specify the addresses of particular Bitcoin nodes in &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Network Info&lt;/code&gt;.

__TOC__

= General node settings =

The bitcoin.conf file needs to contain the following settings (either by adding them or editing the existing ones):

&lt;code&gt;server=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;prune=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;peerbloomfilters=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

which in turn:
* enable the block server mode
* disable the pruning of old blocks
* allow Bisq to run its SPV wallet

Multiple reports have been received, where any declination of the Ronin node just won&amp;#x27;t work, or will work once, only to stop working after the next reboot, requiring a restore to network provided nodes. We are not able to suggest a workaround, except involving Ronin support.

= Connecting to a local Bitcoin node =

If you&amp;#x27;re running a Bitcoin full node on the same machine as Bisq, Bisq should connect to your node on startup—it will look for Bitcoin Core or &lt;code&gt;bitcoind&lt;/code&gt; running on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; on port 8333.

Just make sure to not be running any other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) while starting Bisq.

= Connecting to another Bitcoin node =

By default, Bisq maximizes your privacy by connecting to nodes run by trusted  Bisq contributors. 

If you&amp;#x27;d like to connect to another node, you can specify its address in &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Network Info&lt;/code&gt;. Bisq will validate the address and connect to the specified node the next time it starts.

Bisq supports connecting to Bitcoin nodes with Tor v3 addresses: this is the easiest path to take, since you only have to fill in your node&amp;#x27;s onion address in settings.&lt;br&gt;
If your node is on your local network, connecting directly to it rather than using Tor would reduce latency by a sensible degree. In order to do this:
* make sure the node&amp;#x27;s firewall allows incoming connections on port 8333 from the local network
* have Bitcoin daemon listen to &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; (add a line that says &lt;code&gt;bind=0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;)
* uncheck &amp;quot;Use Tor for Bitcoin network&amp;quot; under Settings&gt;Network in Bisq application
* fill in your node&amp;#x27;s local network &lt;code&gt;ipaddress:8333&lt;/code&gt; in &amp;quot;Use custom bitcoin Core nodes&amp;quot; field

Explaining in detail each step of the above goes past the scope of this guide, yet you can usually find more information either by searching for specific guides, or asking on discussion boards/groups.

= Troubleshooting =

If you get into a state where Bisq is unable to connect, or stuck at SPV resync on the loading screen, you can revert to a provided node as follows.  

For MacOS:
 &lt;code&gt;/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOs/Bisq -btcNodes=ybryiy2k4p4pery4qseap4iu2rxput2akuvpvczwvg4eyfafcdsvyqid.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;
 
For Linux:

 &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=ybryiy2k4p4pery4qseap4iu2rxput2akuvpvczwvg4eyfafcdsvyqid.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;

For Windows:

 &lt;code&gt;%localappdata%\Bisq\Bisq.exe -btcNodes=ybryiy2k4p4pery4qseap4iu2rxput2akuvpvczwvg4eyfafcdsvyqid.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;

Elevated &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;account limits&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; apply to fiat payment accounts in order to limit damage a malicious user can do while allowing honest users to start trading immediately with no KYC and utmost privacy.

Altcoin accounts can trade 0.5 BTC right away, but all fiat payment account types have limits lower than 0.5 BTC to match their particular risk profiles (see [[Payment_methods#Fiat_payment_methods|this table]] for details). Some payment methods with chargeback risk implement a mechanism called &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;account signing&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that restricts trading activity until a trader proves their integrity to further secure against foul play.

To reduce the size of trades entering arbitration Bisq also sets new users trade limits to be 0.1 BTC. This is an additional limit to account limits but users can opt out of this limit at any time.

__TOC__

== Which payment accounts are affected ==

Only fiat payment methods are affected by elevated account limits. Altcoin accounts are only affected by the new user limits which can be opted out if necessary for allow every altcoin account to trade up to 0.5 BTC right away upon creating a payment account in Bisq.

All fiat payment methods in all markets limit total trade size depending on the payment method&amp;#x27;s risk profile (see [[Payment_methods#Fiat_payment_methods|this table]] for details).

Despite these limitations, chargebacks can still be possible for certain payment methods. Bisq reduces this risk with a mechanism called &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;account signing&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.

Account signing only applies to payment accounts that meet &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; of the following conditions:
* used in the following markets: USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, or BRL
* is subject to chargeback risk: SEPA, SEPA Instant, Interac e-Transfer, Zelle, Revolut, Chase QuickPay, Popmoney, MoneyBeam, Uphold, and any kind of bank transfer

This means that all payment accounts that deal in currencies not listed above do &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; require account signing, even if they are subject to chargeback risk.

== Account aging ==

[[File:See-account-age.png|400px|thumb|See account age in the offer book.]]

Account age is no longer used to determine trade size limits for most payment methods. It is still measured, however, and you can see a payment account&amp;#x27;s age in the offer book before taking an offer, but we caution against using it as a measure of integrity. Older accounts are not &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;necessarily&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; safer.

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Practically, this means that all payment methods on Bisq have full selling capability from the moment they are created.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Selling limits no longer phase in over time.

Some payment methods implement a variation of account aging called account signing whereby limits are increased in stages over a period of 60 days after signing. More about this below.

If you&amp;#x27;re interested, details on the &lt;code&gt;AccountAgeWitness&lt;/code&gt; object that enables this aging mechanism are [https://docs.bisq.network/payment-account-age-witness.html here].

== Account signing ==

[[File:Account-signing-overview.png|thumb|right|A graphical overview of account signing.]]

Account signing limits &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;buying&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; limits of risky fiat payment methods to {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} until the trader has bought bitcoin from a seller with a signed payment account, and then gradually phases in full buying limits. Selling limits are unaffected.

In a nutshell, this is how it works:
* Payment account is created in Bisq for risky payment method
** Buying is limited to {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} BTC per trade until account is signed (see how [[#How_to_get_an_account_signed|below]])
* 30 days after signing, buying limits are increased to 50% of maximum
* 60 days after signing, maximum trade size is allowed

Let&amp;#x27;s see how this works in practice by looking at an example. SEPA has a maximum trade size of 0.0624 BTC, and it requires account signing in order for to enable full trade limits. 

First let&amp;#x27;s observe what happens if a new SEPA account is never signed. Notice how buying limits never increase beyond {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}, but selling 0.0624 BTC is allowed from day 0.

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
! Time Since Creating SEPA Payment Account (Never Signed)
! Maximum Trade Size (Buy) 
! Maximum Trade Size (Sell) 
|-
| Day 0 
| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}

|-
| Day 30

| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|-
| Day 90 
| {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|}

If that SEPA account manages to get signed on the same day it&amp;#x27;s created, it will see its {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} limit increased on Day 30. Selling limits are unaffected.

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;

| 0.0624 BTC 
| 0.0624 BTC 
|-

|}

But if that SEPA account isn&amp;#x27;t signed until Day 30, it won&amp;#x27;t see its limits lifted until Day 60. Again, selling limits are unaffected.

=== How to get an account signed ===

Payment accounts that require signing cannot buy more than {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} until 30 days &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;after&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; they are signed. There&amp;#x27;s two ways to get your account signed.

==== Buying BTC ====
To sign your account you have to buy BTC following these requirements:
* trade amount is greater than or equal to {{MinTradeSizeToBeSigned}} BTC and lesser than or equal to {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}
* offer must be in a market that requires signing (USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, BRL)
* seller&amp;#x27;s account must have been signed for over 30 days at the time of the signing trade

Through taking an offer you can make sure that the offer fulfills the requirements to sign your account. Making an offer could not sign your account, because taker could be unable to sign your account (signed since less than 30 days, or unsigned). 

The Bisq interface makes it easy to determine if an offer can help you get signed: simply &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;look for buy offers with a check mark badge&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;:

[[File:Good-bad-signing-asks.png|600px|thumb|left|Top offer won&amp;#x27;t get you signed. Bottom offer will get you signed.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the image above, the offer on top does not have a check mark, but the offer on the bottom does. And it&amp;#x27;s a valid size (i.e., between {{MinTradeSizeToBeSigned}} BTC and {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}}), so taking that offer and successfully completing the trade will result in a signed account.

You can see your payment account&amp;#x27;s limits and signing status at &lt;code&gt;Accounts&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;National Currency Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. Pick an account and look toward the bottom:

[[File:Payment-account-signing-status.png|600px|thumb|left|Where to see your payment account&amp;#x27;s limits and signing status.]]

&lt;div style=&amp;quot;clear: both;&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== With your own signed account ====

Once you have 1 signed payment account, any new payment account you create that requires signing will be self-signed as long as it uses the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;exact same name&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; as your previously signed account. The payment account can be of a different type (e.g. a signed SEPA account can self-sign a SEPA Instant account), but a payment account created with a name that is even slightly different will not be self-signed. 

Payment account types that don&amp;#x27;t require your full name cannot be self-signed (e.g. Revolut, which only requires an email address) and they cannot self-sign other payment accounts.

Self-signed accounts are immediately signed, but limits are not immediately lifted. This is because they have an age of 0 days, so 30 days must pass for the {{MaxTradeSizeUnsigned}} limit to be lifted, and another 30 days must pass for full trading ability to take effect (see tables above).

== Backing up and restoring payment accounts ==

Once your payment accounts have accrued age and been signed, you won&amp;#x27;t want to give them up. With [[Backing_up_application_data|proper backups]], you won&amp;#x27;t have to—payment accounts can be restored if you ever have to remove/reinstall Bisq, move to another machine, etc.

== User opt-out limits ==

To reduce trades into arbitration for new users unfamiliar with Bisq, new users have a 0.1 BTC limit by default that can be opt-out of at any time. 

To access this limit go to Settings &gt; Preferences

[[File:Trade limits.png|frameless|left|Trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or changed at any time]]




Shown above is the trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or edited higher or lower at any time.

If you opt of of this limit you will be given a pop up message informing you...

{{Admonition_Warn|Trading limits are set to reduce risk of costly disputes and losing funds for new users. Raise trading limits at your own risk. Every trader has their own pace, but it&amp;#x27;s recommended to complete at least 5 trades before raising trade limits.

By raising trading limits you acknowledge to be familiar with the basic use of Bisq, like [[Backing_up_application_data|backing up your data]], [[rading_rules|trading rules]], [[Dispute_resolution|dispute resolution]], [[Table_of_penalties|penalties]] and [[User_support|where to find support]].}}

Account signing limits are still applied to buy BTC with most National Account payment methods to reduce chargeback risk.</text></revision></page><page><title>Bisq 1</title><ns>0</ns><id>609</id><revision><id>3803</id><timestamp>2024-12-13T19:27:46Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: Both --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as Both content --&gt;

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall Great Firewall of China] (GFW) makes it difficult to run Bisq from within mainland China.

This article outlines a workaround.

== Requirements ==

You will need a working solution to access the internet already available to you, for example a VPN or a local proxy, and know its IP and port number; Bisq will be made to use that proxy to reach the Tor entry nodes.

Alternatively to the following, also look into the SSTap software bundle, which users report to have successfully implemented to connect to Bisq.

== Steps for Bisq1 ==

You will edit the &lt;code&gt;torrc&lt;/code&gt; default settings that Bisq uses to connect to Tor, and to this extent you will modify a file inside the main &lt;code&gt;jar&lt;/code&gt; file of the application, &lt;code&gt;desktop-&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;version-number&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;-all.jar&lt;/code&gt;
Depending on your operating system, this is where it should be locatedː
* Windowsː &lt;code&gt;Cː\Users\&lt;yourusername&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq\app\&lt;/code&gt;
* Linuxː &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/lib/app/&lt;/code&gt;
* MacOSː &lt;code&gt;$Home/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/app/&lt;/code&gt;

A &lt;code&gt;jar&lt;/code&gt; file is actually a zipped archive, that you can open with 7zip (a mac user reported WinZip working as well); inside the root of this archive, there is a file named &lt;code&gt;torrc&lt;/code&gt; that you have to open in a text editor; its contents will be likeː

 ControlPort auto
 CookieAuthentication 1
 DisableNetwork 1
 AvoidDiskWrites 1
 RunAsDaemon 1
 SOCKSPort auto

Addː
 Socks5Proxy YourProxyIP:port
on a new line, then save the file and make sure your archiving application updates the archive, then start Bisq.

== Steps for Bisq2 ==

As above, pending the existence of a working solution to access the internet, this is how you can set a custom SOCKS5 proxy.

Edit the &lt;code&gt;bisq.conf&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of the Bisq2 data directory (same path as Bisq1 data directory, but ending with &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;) adding what follows:

 application {
   network {
     configByTransportType.tor {
       torrcOverrides {
         Socks5Proxy=&amp;quot;ProxyIP:port&amp;quot;
       }
    }

&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

Bisq can be used all over the world, so it needs to be &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;translated&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; into various languages.

Feel free to contribute voluntary translations for any language, but only translations for languages in current target markets will be compensated. Such languages currently include the following:
* French (fr)
* Chinese (zh_CN, zh_TW) (on hold until mobile app is available)
* German (de)
* Italian (it)
* Japanese (jp)
* Portuguese (pt)
* Russian (ru)
* Spanish (es)

__TOC__

== How to contribute ==

Bisq uses [https://explore.transifex.com/bisq/ Transifex] to translate the three projects it currently has: 
* bisq-desktop
* bisq-website 
* bisq-subtitles

Tasks are coordinated on the [[Matrix_bisq.chat|bisq.chat]] [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.growth:bitcoin.kyoto #Growth] channel.

To contribute, please register on Transifex and request to be included as translator for a language. Transifex will send corresponding notifications to [https://docs.transifex.com/teams/understanding-user-roles managers and coordinators], but it&amp;#x27;s better to also introduce yourself and what you&amp;#x27;d like to do on Matrix.

== Objectives ==

=== Keep core languages for bisq-desktop up-to-date ===

There&amp;#x27;s no budget to update all core languages in every DAO cycle. Languages will be updated one-by-one, starting with the markets which offer more trading volume for Bisq.

== Guidelines ==

* Strings labeled as &lt;code&gt;no_translate&lt;/code&gt; are strings referring to unused altcoins and region specific strings that should be left untranslated or translated using the original English version. If left translated with the original source, don&amp;#x27;t submit them for compensation.

* There&amp;#x27;s no budget for reviews: translated strings will be uploaded and used in the next version release. If a string is confusing, ask for help or leave it for later.

* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;All translations work should be done on Transifex!&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Please don&amp;#x27;t open pull requests to modify non-English text. The Bisq software and website repositories include scripts to automatically integrate all changes on Transifex.

* Propose any changes to English text on GitHub ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/i18n/displayStrings.properties here] for Bisq software and [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-website/blob/master/_data/en.yml here] for the website).

== Compensation ==

As with all Bisq contributions, contributors who want to be compensated for their work should make a [https://docs.bisq.network/compensation.html compensation request]. 

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Only work designated as high-priority by the Transifex Admin will be compensated.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Before you begin, make sure your work has been designated as high-priority by the Transifex Admin. Upon making a compensation request, the Transifex Admin will acknowledge your work to reaffirm your work&amp;#x27;s priority before voting begins.

* A rate of 0.07 USD/word translated to the cycle&amp;#x27;s BSQ equivalent will be used-

* Compensation requests for translations are submitted with screenshots of the Transifex translation panel. The filters used to create a valid screenshot are: &lt;code&gt;translator:&lt;your_username&gt; translated_after:&lt;date_since_last_request&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Be careful, as this query returns every string the specified user last edited, even if the edit is a tiny change from a review instead of a translation. There is no budget for reviews, but if you want to do a review anyway, make sure the original translator has already has been compensated, or that they know how many words they translated (and that they have the requisite proof for their compensation request).

See [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/415 this compensation request] as an example.

&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Switching to a new data directory&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; can help you start with Bisq anew: fresh wallet, new onion address, new keys, etc. It&amp;#x27;s a sort of &amp;quot;factory reset&amp;quot; that makes it like you&amp;#x27;re starting Bisq for the first time.

Upon creating a new data directory, you can restore various parts of a previous data directory (e.g., aged and signed payment accounts).

If you instead wish to only obtain a new wallet, while preserving every other element of your data directory, you can [[Create_a_new_wallet_for_your_data_directory|create a fresh wallet in the same data directory]].

__TOC__

= Why switch to a new data directory? =

It&amp;#x27;s a good idea to switch to a new data directory every so often. 
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Performance&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Bisq uses bitcoinj, an SPV library that is not built for high performance, so wallets get increasingly large with every transaction. Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Stability&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.
* &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Privacy&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see [[local reputation]]).

In addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around [[Troubleshooting_wallet_issues|unusual wallet corruption issues]].

= Make sure you&amp;#x27;re ready to switch =

=== Ensure your existing data directory is backed up ===

[[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_the_entire_Bisq_data_directory|See how here]]. Be sure to also do a [[Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_payment_accounts|payment account export]] to make importing payment accounts easier.

=== Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes ===

This is paramount because &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; If you don&amp;#x27;t want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.

= Send funds =

You will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow. 

There are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.

# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from &lt;code&gt;Funds&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Send Funds&lt;/code&gt;, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you&amp;#x27;ve created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt;).
#* Variation: Use the [[Emergency_wallet|Emergency Wallet Tool]] (&lt;code&gt;Cmd/Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn&amp;#x27;t working.
# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you&amp;#x27;ve created it. This method is &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;not&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See [[Restoring_your_wallet_from_seed#Restoring_to_a_non-Bisq_wallet|derivation path and other details here]].
# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).
## Start Bisq. 
## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the &lt;code&gt;appName&lt;/code&gt; option. See [[Running_from_the_command_line|how to run Bisq from the command line here]].
##* macOS example command: &lt;code&gt;/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new&lt;/code&gt;
##* Name of the new directory doesn&amp;#x27;t matter. &lt;code&gt;Bisq-new&lt;/code&gt; was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it&amp;#x27;s just a temporary placeholder. You&amp;#x27;ll be changing it back to &amp;quot;Bisq&amp;quot; anyway.
## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.
## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.

= Create new data directory =

If you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:
# Close Bisq.
# Delete (or rename) the &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; data directory (see [[Data_directory#Operating_system_defaults|default locations for your operating system here]]).
# Start Bisq again. Bisq will create a new data directory with a new wallet, new Tor state, etc.
# Send funds from external wallet into Bisq.

If you used method 3 in the previous step: 
# Make sure &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;both&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; Bisq instances are closed.
# Delete (or rename) the original &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt; data directory.
# Rename the newer data directory to &lt;code&gt;Bisq&lt;/code&gt;.
# Start Bisq normally. Your balance should reflect the BTC you sent to it previously.

= Migrate data from backup =

If you&amp;#x27;d like to restore payment accounts and/or your onion address (e.g., [[local reputation]]), [[Restoring_application_data|see how in this article]].</text></revision></page><page><title>Installing your own Bitcoin node</title><ns>0</ns><id>575</id><revision><id>3657</id><timestamp>2024-07-22T03:33:58Z</timestamp><text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!-- BISQ VERSION: General --&gt;
&lt;!-- This page is classified as General content --&gt;

It is best practice that any Bitcoin user installs his own node, to send and verify his own transactions; moreover, if you use Bisq consistently, you are strongly encouraged to do so, as it will make the bitcoin network connection much more stable, and especially reduce the risk of needing [[Resyncing_SPV_file|SPV resync]] on a wallet that contains many transactions. Even when a SPV resync is needed, it will be much painless if done while connected to your own node.

__TOC__

= Hardware requirements =

The most demanding part of a full Bitcoin node is disk space: 1TB is considered the bare minimum (2TB is better for future proofing your node), and a SSD is recommended, as the constant write operations would risk damaging the average mechanical disk. There are pruned nodes that will only keep the very last blocks of the blockchain in order to save on disk space, but as Bisq needs a fully verifying node, we will only be examining this case in the present guide.

The following are viable hardware options to host the node:
* refurbished laptop with at least 8GB of RAM
** pros: comes with display, keyboard, and basic storage (existing storage will need to be replaced or expanded), can run multiple services and act as a full fledged home server, has builtin UPS
** cons: drains more power and is more expensive than a Raspberry Pi 3, takes up more space on your shelf
* dedicated Raspberry Pi 3
** pros: very small, low power, completely silent
** cons: no builtin display, keyboard nor storage, very low performance, needs more initial maintenance
* your daily driver machine
** pros: no need to source additional hardware (except the additional storage if it&amp;#x27;s not enough), will likely not suffer from the limited additional overhead of a Bitcoin node while you use it normally
** cons: you either have to leave it always running, to keep updated with blocks as soon as they are mined, or will have to wait a variable amount of time for it to catch up to the current block height each time you turn it on, before you can use Bisq

= Installing the software =

When installing the Bitcoin node software, you will be either working on a graphical user interface, or on a system that only operates via command line (most likely the Raspberry).

== Systems with graphical interface ==

Unless you want to install a leaner daemon setup and follow the command-line steps below, installing directly on a graphical interface is the easier path, as you can download and verify the files as per the instructions on https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ and then install the software as you normally would on your operating system, making sure you point it to the 1TB drive to save the blockchain.

== Systems with command line interface ==

You may choose to run a dedicated refurbished laptop on Linux and without a desktop environment, and it would be a wise choice; regarding a Raspberry, while you could install a graphical desktop environment on a Pi 3, it is absolutely not recommended to do so, because it will be a self-contained system that will only cater to the task of running the node software, and any additional load, like keeping the graphical interface in memory, will degrade its performance.

There is a well known step-by-step guide that will illustrate how to install a full Bitcoin Node on a Raspberry, called the [https://raspibolt.org/ RaspiBolt Guide], plus its amd64/desktop counterpart, directed at laptops/PCs, called [https://minibolt.info MiniBolt]. They both include a section dedicated to installing software for a Lightning Network node, but you will only need to follow the guide for your system up to the configuration of the Bitcoin client.

== Caveats ==

There have been multiple reports about the Ronin node package not allowing Bisq to connect (after the first time), and we know no tested solution for this issue, so it is recommended using the steps above to obtain the Bitcoin node software.

== Common steps ==

No matter the path you chose above, you will have to wait a considerable amount of time after installing the node.

The initial block download will have your Bitcoin client fetch from the p2p network, and verify one by one, all the blocks since the genesis, which at the time of writing amounts to 570GB of data, so expect from 2 to 10 days of uninterrupted CPU and network activity, depending on the connection (whether clearnet or Tor) and the performance of the hardware (a faster machine will complete the block verification and writing to disk in less time)

= Setup the node to accept connections from Bisq =

For the bitcoin connection on Bisq to be effective, you will need to make sure the node&amp;#x27;s configuration is correct.
If you installed the client via command line interface following the guides linked above, you will probably have a working config file already, but in case you installed the GUI client, you will have to manually edit the &lt;code&gt;bitcoin.conf&lt;/code&gt; file from within the settings, and make sure it contains the following:

&lt;code&gt;server=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;prune=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;peerbloomfilters=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

which in turn:
* enable the block server mode
* disable the pruning of old blocks
* allow Bisq to run SPV queries on the node

If the node is running on a separate machine, but on the same local network, it needs to listen for connections from external clients as well, and the easiest way of doing this is to add the following to the config file:

&lt;code&gt;bind=0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;

No need for the above if the node runs on a different network, and you will connect to it via Tor.

After any change to the &lt;code&gt;bitcoin.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, the bitcoin client needs to be restarted.

If, on the same remote machine running the node, you installed &lt;code&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; as the Bolt guides suggest, you have to allow incoming connections on port 8333 (edit the local network base address as needed):

&lt;code&gt;sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/24 to any port 8333 comment &amp;#x27;Bitcoin p2p&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt;

= Setup the connection from Bisq to the node =

The following will change depending on where the node is located respectively to Bisq.

== Connecting to a node on the same PC ==

If the Bitcoin node is installed on the same machine as Bisq, the latter will automatically connect to it without the need to edit anything. Considering how Bisq will only run on amd64 architecture, you can achieve this with either your daily driver, or a dedicated laptop/desktop through direct or remote access (for example via [[Remote_control_via_web_browser_using_xpra|xpra]]).

Make sure no other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) are running while starting Bisq.

== Connecting to a Bitcoin node on the same local network ==

After setting the config file to accept connections from external machines, as explained above, you will have to setup Bisq to connect to the remote node. This should be achieved by launching Bisq with the following command-line parameters (as an example, the node on the local network is at 10.0.0.21, edit the command to match your situation):

&lt;code&gt;Bisq -btcNodes=10.0.0.21:8333 -useTorForBtc=false&lt;/code&gt;

Once Bisq has started, you should verify under Settings &gt; Network, that these settings are replicated, in particular you should see that the node&amp;#x27;s IP:port is filled in the address field, and the &amp;quot;Use Tor for Bitcoin Network&amp;quot; checkbox is disabled.

== Connecting to a remote node through the Tor Network ==

If you installed the node software on a machine that is geographically separate from your local network, and you followed the Bolt guides, it will be already connecting to the internet through Tor, so you can point Bisq to its onion address.

On the node&amp;#x27;s machine&amp;#x27;s shell, run

&lt;code&gt;bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion&lt;/code&gt;

to obtain your onion address, copy it to the clipboard and paste it in Bisq under Settings &gt; Network &gt; Use Custom Bitcoin Core nodes 

Bisq will offer to restart, thus connecting to the custom remote node.

= Verify the connection =

Once you connect to your own node, Bisq will show &lt;code&gt;Bitcoin network peers: 1&lt;/code&gt; in the bottom right corner, and under Settings &gt; Network you will notice the node is the only one listed under &amp;quot;Bitcoin network&amp;quot;.

= Troubleshooting =

If you get into a state where Bisq is unable to connect, you can revert to a provided node as follows.  

For MacOS:
 &lt;code&gt;Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;
 
For Linux:

 &lt;code&gt;/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;

For Windows:

 &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\your-username-here\AppData\Local\Bisq\Bisq.exe -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true &lt;/code&gt;
