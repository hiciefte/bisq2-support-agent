Bisq Easy Trade Protocol Specifics
Trade fees
There are no trade fees for buyers or sellers for trading on Bisq Easy.
Mining fees
Buyers will not have to pay any mining fees when they trade on Bisq Easy.
Sellers will need to pay any fees required to send the bitcoin to the buyer after receiving their payment.  For on chain transactions the seller is responsible for paying mining fees needed to send the bitcoin to the buyer's waller.  For lighting transactions the seller is responsible for paying any routing fees needed to pay the buyer's ln invoice.
Security mechanisms
The security of the trade is proportional to the reputation of the seller.
As Bisq Easy is
reputation based
, and reputation provides a fairly low security model, it means traders on Bisq Easy are suited only to rather small amounts of bitcoin.
By default buyers can only exchange messages with sellers that have a certain level of reputation, however, buyers can opt-out from that protection.
Trading with sellers without reputation, or very low reputation, carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.
Currencies / Payment Methods
Bisq Easy buyers and sellers can trade bitcoin for any type of fiat.
Fiat buyers and sellers can choose whatever type of payment method they agree upon for fiat transfer.
Dispute mechanisms
Buyers and sellers trading on Bisq Easy can access mediation support should anything go wrong with their trade.
Mediators will be able to:
Help facilitate the successful completion of the trade
Confirm fiat / altcoin and bitcoin payments
Help cancel trade if needed
Report a trader who severely violated the trade rules to the moderator who can ban the user.
Depending on the form of reputation used, a fraudulent seller can get their bonded BSQ confiscated by the DAO or their Bisq 1 onion address banned. As all reputation is linked to the user profile, a banned user profile disables their reputation.
Security deposit requirements
Bisq Easy trades do not require any security deposits from either the buyer or seller.
Privacy benefits / trade-offs
As no security deposits are required buyers and sellers using fiat will be revealing their bank account details to users that might end up backing out of the trade. If a user backs out of a trade there is less possibility to penalize them than if they had to trade using a security deposit. The seller can report a buyer who cancelled the trade after the payment account data has been transmitted to the moderator, who can ban the buyer.
Identity
Buyers and sellers on Bisq Easy can create multiple identities.

How to buy bitcoin on Bisq Easy
Buying Bitcoin with Bisq Easy is recommended for small fiat amounts, or as a starting point if you still have no Bitcoin that you can use for the security deposits of other trade protocols.
You can opt for two ways to find a trading partner to get some Bitcoin: taking an existing offer or creating one.
Creating an offer
Creating an offer is a great way to establish your own terms and simply wait for someone to match what you are after. It is also the right option if you don't find any offers with the right premium or payment methods in the market you want to trade in. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and create a new offer in it:
Begin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select
Bisq Easy
on the left panel, and
Offerbook
on the top tab.
Each different national currency has its own market. You can click on the displayed pair to open a selector where you can choose the currency you would like to trade in. In this example, we are interested in buying some Bitcoin by paying with Euros, so we will select the
BTC/EUR
pair, but you should select whatever currency you are using. Afterward, click on the
Create offer
button on the right-hand side.
You will now enter the offer creation wizard. The first step will be to choose between buying or selling Bitcoin. Select
Buy Bitcoin
and click on
Next
.
On the following screen, you will be asked for confirmation on which currency you want to pay your Bitcoin with. The selected currency will be the one you selected in the previous
Offerbook
screen. You can change your mind here if needed. Since for this example we want to move forward with Euros, we don't need to change anything on this screen, and we can simply click
Next
.
On the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods are you willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select
SEPA
and
Revolut
.
Besides the presented Payment Methods, you can also add customized Payment Methods to your offer. For instance, for this offer, I would be happy to make a cash deposit at a Rabobank physical branch. I can use the bottom input to add this method to my offer.
Once you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking
Next
.
On the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is the equivalent of 600 USD.  You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.
You also have the option of defining a range instead of a fixed value for the trade amount. By doing that, you set a minimum and maximum amount, and you signal to the market that you are willing to trade any amount between those two numbers. For this example, we will create an offer with a range between 100€ and 200€. Once you have set your fixed value or a range, click
Next
to move on.
With this, you will reach the final step of the offer creation wizard. The final screen shows a summary of all the details you have defined. Now is the time for you to review whether everything is fine. This is important because, once you click on
Create offer
, the offer will be available for anyone to take and, once that happens, it will be binding. So, make sure you are happy with the details you see. Once you are sure, click on
Create offer
and your offer will be added to the market.
Your order is finally ready. Now, you will have to wait until another peer takes it. If your offer remains unpicked for longer than you would like to, consider modifying it to add additional payment methods or adding a more flexible range of values that could attract different users.
Once a peer takes your offer, you will receive a notification and be able to see the started trade in the
Open Trades
panel of Bisq Easy. Also, keep in mind that offers remain open until you close them. If you only want to transact once, you should close it after it gets taken, or more peers could keep taking it!
Taking an offer
Taking an existing offer is the fastest and simplest way to find a partner and start trading. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and pick an existing offer in it.
Begin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select
Bisq Easy
on the left panel, and
Getting started
on the top tab.
On this page, click on the
Start trade wizard
. This is the easiest way to get started. A small note: once you become more experienced, you might prefer to use the
Offerbook
page to do your trades. But for the first trades, we advise using the trade wizard.
With this, you will enter the trade wizard, which will guide you step by step through the process of taking an existing offer to buy some Bitcoin. In the first screen, select
Buy Bitcoin
and click on
Next
.
In the following screen, you need to indicate which national currency you want to use to pay your trading partner. Since we want to use Euros for this trade, we select that currency in the list. Once you have selected your currency, click on
Next
to move on.
On the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods you are willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select
SEPA
and
Revolut
.
Once you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking
Next
.
On the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq Easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is the equivalent of 600 USD.  You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.
For this example, let's imagine we would like to buy 150€ worth of Bitcoin. We set the value and click on
Next
to move on.
In the following screen, you will be presented a list of offers that match your needs. You can select any of the offers presented, but we advise taking the first offer. By default, offers will be presented by decreasing reputation, so the most trusted trades will be on the top of the list. You can check other offers that might have more interesting prices, but be aware that the lower the reputation of the trader, the higher the risk you will face. If you want to keep things safe and simple, simply pick the first offer that you see. Once you have settled for an offer, click on
Next
to move on.
The final screen will allow you to review all the details. Make sure you are happy with all the details of the trade, since once you move on, you will effectively commit to doing the trade. If there's anything you want to change, you can always navigate back and modify any of the trade details. Once you are ready, click on
Confirm trade
.
Once you have done this, the offer is taken and you can begin the trade process. You can read more about the trade process here:
Trade Process
.
Remember that when you take an offer, you commit to follow through. Be aware that, once you take it, you can't simply back down without consequences.
Note that there is also a chance that no offers are found matching your needs. If this is the case, you will see a screen like the one below. You can wait some time and try again later, or you can instead create your own offer. You can read more about creating an offer here
Creating a buy offer

How to stay safe on Bisq Easy
Here are some tips for keeping safe when trading on Bisq Easy and avoiding any scams.
Tips for bitcoin buyers
Bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before sending any bitcoin. For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.
Start with a small amount as a test trade
Start chatting with the seller before sending the fiat payment to check that they are still active
Choose a seller with a high reputation. The higher the reputation of the seller the better. Sellers need a minimum reputation score of 30,000, ideally you should be choosing to trade with someone higher than this. Look at the star system for guidance. It will be safer to trade with a 5 star rated seller than a 1 star rated seller.
Send payment as soon as possible once you have the seller's account details.
Only send payment to the account details provided by the Seller in the trade chat window. If the seller is trying to change the account they want you to send payment to, it would be better to cancel the trade and open a new trade with another seller.
Do not include any references with your payments. For example do send a payment with a reference 'cycle' or worse 'bitcoin'. This could cause issues for both the seller and yourself. If a reference is required keep use your account name as the reference. This will allow the seller to know the payment is from yourself and not give any information away other than what they already know.
Send the payment from the same account you share the information with in trader chat. For example if you are having problems with the payment do not send payment from your partners, business, friends etc account. Instead try and resolve the issue so you can send payment from the correct account and failing that open mediation to get additional support.
Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the seller via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.
Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.
Tips for bitcoin sellers
Although bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before bitcoin sellers send them any bitcoin, sellers should still be aware of buyers attempting any charge-back scams. There is almost no cost for a bitcoin buyer to create an account and start making trades, therefore, there is little for a buyer to lose by attempting a scam. Almost all buyers on Bisq Easy will be honest but it is still good to be cautious.
For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.
Be careful when dealing with buyers with brand new accounts (the buyer's account age is shown in their profile).
Avoid payment methods that have a high possibility of charge-backs eg; PayPal, Venmo
Make sure the payment you receive matches the buyers account details. Avoid sending bitcoin to buyer's with mis-matching account details. It would be better to refund the payment to the account you received the payment from and cancel the trade.
Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the buyer via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.
Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.
If you have any concerns about a trade open mediation.
