{"title": "Automatic backup script", "content": "The biggest issues for users happen when data files are lost or corrupted, leading to missing or borked trades, or unrecoverable Delayed Payout Transactions.\n\nHaving an automated backup solution helps covering that risk, by removing the need to manually run a backup after every application state change (mainly \"offer created\", \"trade started\", \"trade completed\").\n\nIssues could still happen when a critical event occurs right after a state change was saved to disk, and before an automated backup was taken, but there are strategies to mitigate that possibility, which will be discussed.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Common requirements and backup strategy =\n\nAll scripts require 7z compression (7-zip on Windows, p7zip-full on Linux, p7zip on MacOS).\n\nThe code will backup all functional files in the data directory, leaving out non-unique files that the Bisq application will fetch/re-create autonomously, and compress them into a 7zip archive, keeping the number of last backups that you define, while deleting the oldest one(s) if the existing number of backups is higher.\n\nIt is advised that you direct the backups to either an external drive, or a NAS, or an encrypted cloud storage.\n\nDepending on how bulletproof of a backup schedule you want, you can increase the number of backups to keep on disk to 10 or more (the size of each depends on the history of your instance, but it usually resides in a few tens of MB, often less) and the frequency the script runs with, for example every 1 or 2 hours.\n\n= Bisq1

{"title": "BSQ swaps", "content": "**BSQ swaps** allow BSQ colored bitcoin and BTC to be traded atomically: instantly, risklessly, with less fees, and with no special Bisq account setup required.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Process\n\nWith the BSQ swap protocol, BSQ and BTC can be traded in a single transaction without much of the baggage of the conventional trade protocol.\n\nFrom a user's perspective, the process is rather seamless. No special payment accounts need to be created. The offer maker creates the offer (BSQ is default trade currency).\n\n600px|thumb|left|Creating a BSQ swap offer.\n\nAs long as the offer maker has enough of what they want to trade in their wallet (either BTC or BSQ), the offer will be live and visible on the network. If the relevant wallet balance ever goes below the amount required to complete the swap, the swap offer automatically deactivates.\n* if a user creates a swap offer to sell 1000 BSQ, the offer will remain live as long as their BSQ wallet has more than 1000 BSQ\n* if a user creates a swap offer to buy 0.5 BTC, the offer will remain live as long as their Bisq BTC wallet has more than 0.5 BTC\n\nOffers can still be activated or deactivated manually in Portfolio > My Open Offers as usual.\n\nTaken offers show in a new BSQ Swap Trades tab on the Portfolio screen.\n\nOf course, this trade protocol can only work while both users are online, but Bisq offers can only be taken when both maker and taker are online anyway, and these trades can be settled almost instantly so there is no further expectation that users be online for any particular amount of time (e.g. for 1 hour with instant altcoins offers).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSince the protocol is trustless, BSQ swaps do not require Bisq's conventional dispute resolution.\n\nRarely, an invalid transaction could be committed to your wallet. In such a case, you will need to resync your SPV file to get rid of it.\n\n## Background\n\n## = Transaction structure\n=\n\nHere we cover the basic mechanics of BSQ swaps.\n\nBTC buyers and sellers need to pay BTC mining fees and BSQ trading fees, but the BSQ swap protocol simplifies the transaction by only having BTC inputs for BTC sellers and BSQ inputs for BSQ sellers. The appropriate deductions are made from the outputs (e.g. the BTC buyer/BSQ seller gets BTC with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted; similarly, the BTC seller/BSQ buyer gets BSQ with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted).\n\nNow let us examine an example trade to see the structure of such a transaction.\n\nThis is how a transaction for a 1 BTC/50,000 BSQ swap with a 0.5 BSQ maker fee and 1.5 BSQ taker fee would look. We estimate the buyer's share of the mining fee to be 2000 sats and the seller's share of the mining fee to be 2500 sats.\n\nAssuming Alice makes an offer to buy BTC (sell BSQ) and Bob takes her offer (making him BTC seller/BSQ buyer):\n\n* Alice's BSQ input(s): min. 50,000 BSQ + 0.5 BSQ trade fee\n* Bob's BTC input(s): min. 1 BTC + 2500 sat - 150 sat (his BSQ trade fee will be used for mining fee, so he needs a bit less of a mining fee)\n* Bob's BSQ payout output: 50,000 BSQ - 1.5 BSQ trade fee\n* Alice's BSQ change output: xxx BSQ - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact\n* Alice's BTC payout output: 1 BTC - 2000 sat miner fee + 50 sat from BSQ fee\n* Bob's BTC change output: yyy BTC - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact\n\n## = Spam prevention\n=\n\nWith the conventional Bisq trade protocol, the maker fee transaction acts as a spam prevention measure: you cannot create an offer without spending bitcoin.\n\nThe BSQ swap protocol has no such transaction, so instead, a proof-of-work (POW) mechanism is used. The difficulty level (number of leading zeros) is set in the filter. When creating an offer, the maker does the required POW and attaches the resulting data to their offer. Each node verifies the POW and only shows offers with valid POW.\n\nIf POW difficulty is increased, offer makers must re-do their POW in the background and republish their offers. Old offers are removed from the network and new offers with new POW are added.\n\nEach offer has a counter appended to its offer ID (after the version number, in the full offer ID) each time a new POW is completed. This enables each re-published offer with new POW to have a new offer ID that looks the same to users (since the short offer ID doesn't change).\n\nAt first, POW difficulty will be set to a very low value so users do not notice anything (low milliseconds on modern laptop hardware), but will be increased as needed.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Bisq 2", "content": "Bisq 2 is the successor to the original Bisq (Bisq v1). It has been developed from the ground up to allow for multiple trade protocols to be accessed via a single decentralized exchange platform.\n\nAt the initial launch of Bisq 2 will support only one trading protocol 'Bisq Easy'. Over time more trading protocols will be added.\n\nOnce the Bisq Multisig protocol is implemented in Bisq 2, the old version of Bisq can fade out. Bisq 1 will still find its usage as Bisq DAO management tool and for BSQ-BTC trading.\n\nSimilar to Bisq v1, Bisq 2 will be a decentralized bitcoin exchange that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies.\n\n* Bisq 2 is a desktop application that works across platforms.\n* Bisq 2 allows users to choose between multiple trading protocols to find the best fit for their preference. Aspects like privacy and security, convenience, costs and trade duration will differ and the user can make the choice.\n* Bisq 2 is a peer-to-peer network that enables users to find people to trade with, make and take offers to buy and sell bitcoin, communicate with their trading peers and when necessary access support.\n* Bisq 2 is privacy focused, no verified accounts or KYC will be required and run over the Tor network (as well as I2P in future).\n* Bisq 2 is self custodial. Your keys are always under your control.\n* Bisq 2 is open source (AGPL) and built and maintained by contributors who form the Bisq DAO.\n\n## Why Bisq 2?\n\nBisq v1 is a powerful tool for bitcoiners that want to be able to buy and sell bitcoin peer to peer whilst maintaining their privacy, not having to undergo arduous KYC processes, and keeping control of their bitcoin.\n\nBisq v1 was launched on mainnet in April 2016 and whilst there has been constant improvements to the trade protocol and user interface over the years it was designed from the outset to support only one trade protocol. As bitcoin has developed and Bisq user base has grown there has been an obvious need for Bisq to expand its offerings to offer more options to its users for example trades over lightning and access via mobile devices. Bisq 2 is the first step to develop something that is built from the ground up to be more accessible to users and provide access to multiple trading protocols that can expand over time.\n\nThe core benefits of Bisq 2 are:\n\n## = Multiple Trade Protocols\n=\n\nBisq 2 will offer a variety of trade protocols for users. Each trade protocol will come with its own benefits and tradeoffs. Having multiple protocols allows users to choose what trade protocols are best for them based on; convenience, security, miner costs, trade fees, privacy, available support etc. All trade protocols can be accessed independently and users can switch between protocols for different trades.\n\nThe follow trade protocols are on the roadmap:\n\n* Bisq Easy: Reputation based trading with no security deposit requirements (included in the initial launch)\n* Bisq Multisig: Similar to the current trade protocol used by Bisq 1 but with some improvements\n\n* Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC <-> mainnet BTC\n\n* Liquid Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC <-> Liquid BTC\n\n* Liquid Multisig: Bisq Multisig ported to Liquid network with faster confirmation, lower fees and better privacy (confidential transactions)\n\n* Bisq Lightning: LN BTC <-> Fiat (chain of multiple protocols: Liquid Submarine Swaps, Liquid Multisig)\n* Liquid Swaps: Atomic swap of Liquid BTC <-> Liquid assets like L-USDT\n\n* BSQ Swaps: Atomic swap of BSQ <-> BTC\n* Monero Swaps: Cross chain atomic swap of BTC <-> XMR\n\nFind out more about the trade protocols Bisq 2 will use.\n\n## = Multiple privacy networks\n=\nBisq 2 will support multiple privacy networks. Initially it will only support Tor but I2P support is already implemented but in an experimental state. Upcoming privacy networks like Nym could be added in future if they fit the requirements.\n\nHaving multiple networks adds resilience in case one network has availability issues (as it happened multiple times with Tor when DoS attacks decreased the Tor network stability and with that Bisq's availability and stability).\n\nThe P2P network has also a built in DoS protection using Proof of Work and comes with many improvements compared to the Bisq 1 P2P network.\n\n## =Multiple Identities\n=\n\nBisq 1 used a single onion address and key pair which represent the user's identity. Bisq 2 will allow users to create multiple identities, giving the user more control and better privacy. The user can choose between the highest level of convenience and use just one global identity for all interactions (like Bisq 1) or at the other extreme use a separate identity for any type of interaction (e.g. use a different identity for each trade as well as for each chat room). And anything in between (separating fiat and altcoin trades,...).\n\nFind out more about how Bisq 2 manages identities.\n\n## = Multiple applications\n=\n\nThe reference implementation will be the Bisq 2 JavaFx desktop application.\n\nBut there is also ongoing work on a HTML interface with a headless application to be used on personal Node projects like Start9, Umbrel, MyNode,...\n\nBeside that there will be a REST API (useful for trading bots,...).\n\nBisq Easy can be implemented as a mobile app (at least for Android there are no conceptual or technical hurdles).\n\n## = Multiple wallets\n=\n\nAt launch time Bisq 2 will not include a wallet, but work is underway to support multiple wallet options.\n\nBitcoin core as a full wallet is already implemented (but not exposed in the UI). For users who do not want to run a full Bitcoin node, there will be a light wallet option. Currently Electrum is implemented but we might change to another solution.\n\nFor the different trade protocols there will be the specific wallets required. E.g. for Liquid the Elements wallet is already integrated. For Monero Swaps we need to provide an interface for using the Monero wallet. Find out more about the Bisq 2 wallet.\n\n## = Bonded Roles\n=\n\nThe contributors providing the resources and infrastructure for Bisq 2 will require their roles to be bonded. This concept was also used in Bisq 1 but as it was not strictly enforced by the system, not all roles are secured by bonds as it was envisioned. In Bisq 2 having set up a BSQ bond is mandatory for most roles and node operators and enforced by the system.\n\nFind out more about the Bisq 2 roles.\n\n## Bisq 1 vs Bisq 2\n\nWhen Bisq 2 is launched it will initially only use the one trade protocol 'Bisq Easy' therefore the differences are based on a 2-of-2 multisig protocol (Bisq 1) vs a reputation based trade protocol (Bisq Easy).\n\n## Bisq Easy\n\nBisq Easy was designed for new Bitcoin users who have not yet purchased Bitcoin and therefore cannot use Bisq 1 due the requirements of the security deposit. A lot of effort was put into making it as simple to use as possible.\n\nBisq Easy tries to replicate the experience of a novice Bitcoiner visiting a Bitcoin meetup and getting a gentle and friendly introduction into the Bitcoin world as well as the opportunity to purchase their first Bitcoin from a helpful peer. This is inspired by the famous Satoshi Squares (early days informal Bitcoin meetups), which was also the initial name inspiration for Bitsquare - the previous brand name of Bisq.\n\nThe seller is expected to be an experienced Bitcoin and Bisq user and to have built up a reputation. The seller should be helpful and serve as guide through the newbie's first Bitcoin trade.\n\nBisq Easy tries to be a much more social experience as it is the case on Bisq 2. It also provides a \"learn\" section where newbies can learn about important topics like wallets, privacy and security. The various sections for chat rooms should also boost the social and communicative aspect of Bisq Easy.\n\n## = Main differences for BTC buyers\n=\n\nInitially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow for users to buy bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no miner fees. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to buy bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs.\n\nThe tradeoff for Bisq 2 is that the security of the trade will be based on seller reputation as opposed to Bisq 1 where the security of the trade is based on bitcoin collateral secured in the multisig.\n\nTherefore, Bisq 2 will be cheaper and more convenient to trade for bitcoin buyers but at the cost of less robust security than Bisq 1. This is opposed to Bisq 1 that will be more secure but also more expensive, in terms of trade and miner fees, and less convenient for bitcoin buyers.\n\nBisq 2 will initially be more suitable for users wanting to complete trades for small amounts of bitcoin, whereas, Bisq 1 will continue to be suitable for users wanting to complete trades for larger amounts of bitcoin.\n\n## = Main differences for BTC sellers\n=\n\nInitially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow users to sell bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no security deposit. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to sell bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs.\n\nSellers on Bisq 2 will be expected to build their reputation. This can be done in multiple ways but to achieve a high reputation they will need to either burn BSQ and / or create a BSQ bond that locks in a specific amount of BSQ for a specified length of time.\n\nThe first iteration of Bisq 2 will have more buyers than sellers. That means a small number of sellers will be servicing the buyers. Bitcoin sellers on Bisq 2 will be required to make a judgement on how best to achieve their reputation and what the cost of doing so will involve. Bitcoin seller's using Bisq 2 will also need to account for the fact that bitcoin buyers are not putting down a security deposit for their trades so there will likely be a higher trade abandonment than in Bisq 1.\n\nIt is expected that some bitcoin sellers currently active on Bisq 1 may choose to experiment with Bisq 2, and the number of buyers and sellers on Bisq 2 will grow over time.\n\nAs in Bisq 1 seller's will be able to choose the price above or below market they wish to sell their bitcoin for.\n\nDue to the requirements on bonds and the potential higher effort on communication with a newbie Bitcoiner, the price premium can be expected to be much higher than in Bisq 1 (maybe 10-15% above market). The Seller is the one who sets the price.\n\n## How Bisq 2 keeps data private\n\nBisq 2 achieves data privacy for users in the same way as Bisq 1:\n\n* Using Bisq requires no registration or centralized identity verification\n* Every Bisq application connects to the Bisq network with a Tor hidden service (as well as I2P in future)\n* Bisq has no central servers or databases to record data\n* Data is encrypted such that trade details are readable only by counter-parties\n\n## How Bisq 2 resists censorship\n\nBisq 2 achieves censorship resistance in the same way as Bisq 1:\n\n* Bisq’s network is a fully distributed P2P network, and thus difficult to shut down\n* Bisq’s network is built on top of Tor (I2P), and thus inherits Tor’s own censorship resistance\n* Bisq is an open source project and a DAO, not a company; it is not incorporated, and thus cannot be dis-incorporated\n\n## Advanced configurations for Bisq 2\n\nFor users that want to tinker with the default config setting. Bisq 2 supports users to add a config file in the data directory which overrides the default config.\n\nThis can be useful instead of dealing with command line options. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.\n\nFor more info see the GitHub pull request [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/pull/2201 here].\n\n## Installation\n\n## = Download and verify\n=\n\nBisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.\n\nTo import the key in Linux and MacOS:\n\ncurl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import\n\nGPG will return \"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\", this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)\n\nTo verify the installer against the signature:\n\ngpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}\n\nReplace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.\n\nIn Windows you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].\n\n## = Known issues with installation\n=\n\n**MacOS**\n\nNotarization was removed from the build pipeline because of the risk of Apple certification revocation ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions/6341 GitHub issue]). Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS.\n\nPlease follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section \"If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer\".\n\nIf you are using macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to execute the following in your terminal to be able to start Bisq 2:\n\nsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq2.app\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your password to execute the command as super user, and this should allow you to start Bisq 2 normally.\n\n**Windows**\n\nThe developer code signing was removed for the same reason as above. You can ignore the warning after having verified the installer.\n\nThere are known issues with antivirus software: Bisq or Tor processes could be prevented from running, files could get deleted in the data directory [2] or the application directory [1]), or startup could be delayed to the point that Tor is terminated, and a lockfile is left behind preventing Bisq from being started again (this requires you to restart Windows in order to remove the lockfile).

{"title": "Bisq 2 Roles", "content": "In Bisq 2, certain network functions and processes rely on contributors who take responsibility for specific **bonded roles**. These roles require locking BSQ as a bond, approved by the DAO, ensuring accountability and security for the network's decentralized infrastructure.\n\nThere are two main types of bonded roles in Bisq 2: System Roles and Delegable Roles.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## System Roles\n\nSystem roles must be performed by the specifically authorized contributor approved by the DAO. For security reasons, these roles cannot be delegated to others.\n\n## = Mediator\n=\n\nMediators in Bisq 2 primarily assist users of the Bisq Easy trade protocol if they encounter issues during a trade. Mediators cannot control user funds and have no direct enforcement powers. However, if a trader is behaving poorly (e.g., attempting scams), mediators can provide information to Moderators, who may then ban users for severe or repeated violations of trade rules.\n\n## = Moderator\n=\n\nModerators help ensure the smooth operation of the Bisq Easy trade protocol in Bisq 2. Their responsibilities include:\n\n* Monitoring offers to remove spam.\n* Handling reports from users or mediators regarding violations of Bisq Easy rules.\n* Investigating potential violations.\n* Banning user profile IDs found to be in violation.\n* Flagging chat messages that violate communication rules.\n\nNote: Due to Bisq 2's support for multiple identities, banning a profile ID may have limited effect, as users can potentially create new profiles.\n\n## = Security Manager\n=\n\nThe Security Manager role is similar to the \"filter operator\" role in Bisq 1. Key functions include:\n\n* Publishing data to block malicious or malfunctioning roles/nodes.\n* Halting trading for specific protocols during critical security incidents.\n* Broadcasting alert messages to the network or specific users.\n\nUsers retain control, as they can choose to deactivate the security manager's filtering influence or ignore alerts if they wish. Alert types include:\n\n* **INFO:** Informational popup message.\n* **WARN:** Warning popup message.\n* **HALT_TRADE:** Custom emergency popup message that disables trade operations for a specified protocol.\n* **BAN:** Broadcasts data about a banned role (no text message).\n\n## = Update Manager\n=\n\nThe Update Manager (or Release Manager) broadcasts notifications about new software versions to the network. Notification types include:\n\n* **PRE_RELEASE:** Notifies users about new pre-releases (users can opt-in via settings; default is off).\n* **RELEASE:** Notifies users about a new official release.\n* **FORCED_UPDATE:** Displays a warning popup about a mandatory update to a minimum required version. Trade operations may be halted until the user updates.\n\n## Delegable Roles\n\nDelegable roles perform tasks based on publicly available data and do not need to maintain consensus with other peers. Any user can potentially operate these roles themselves, often configured via JVM arguments.\n\n## = Seed Node\n=\n\nSeed nodes serve as initial contact points for the P2P network. They provide network routing information and filtered Bitcoin blockchain data to new nodes joining the network or light clients. When a Bisq node starts, it contacts several seed nodes to sync network data. At least one hardcoded (root) seed node is necessary for bootstrapping the network.\n\n## = Oracle Node\n=\n\nOracle nodes provide essential data services bridging Bisq 1 information and Bisq 2 functions. There must always be at least one operational oracle node. Services include:\n\n##\nDAO Bridge Service\n##\n\nThis service retrieves DAO data (like bond status and reputation events - BSQ burns/bonds) from a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts it reliably to the Bisq 2 network.\n\n* **Verification:** Users can independently verify the integrity of this data by querying a Bisq 1 API node themselves. If discrepancies suggesting intentionally incorrect data are found and reported, a DAO proposal can be made to confiscate the offending oracle operator's bond.\n\n##\nReputation Service\n##\n\nThis service retrieves data relevant to reputation sources like Bisq 1 account age and signed account age via a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts it to the Bisq 2 network.\n\n##\nTime-Stamping Service\n##\n\nThis service provides timestamps used for calculating the age of Bisq 2 user profiles.\n\n## = Explorer Nodes\n=\n\nExplorer nodes provide information about blockchain transaction states, used during the trade process. For example, they might inform users when a Bitcoin payment transaction receives sufficient confirmations.\n\n## = Market Price Node\n=\n\nMarket Price Nodes supply current market price information (e.g., BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) used for setting offer prices relative to the market. Because trades rely on this data, operators of these nodes are required to be bonded.\n\n## Becoming a Bonded Role Holder in Bisq 2\n\nContributors performing bonded roles are typically established Bisq contributors who have been formally approved by the DAO through a voting process. This ensures accountability for these critical network functions.\n\nThe general process is:\n\n1. A potential contributor creates a proposal outlining their intention and qualifications for a specific role on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository].\n2. The proposal is discussed publicly within the community on the GitHub issue.\n3. If there is rough consensus, the contributor then creates a formal \"Bonded Role Proposal\" within the Bisq (v1) application. They must have sufficient BSQ available to cover the required bond amount for the role.\n4. The proposal is submitted to the DAO for stakeholder voting.\n5. If the vote passes, the specified BSQ bond is automatically locked, the contributor's role is registered, and they can begin performing their duties. If rejected, the BSQ is returned.\n\nFor more general information on contributing to Bisq, see the Contributor Checklist. Note that not all contribution tasks require bonding, providing an easier path for new contributors to get involved and build reputation.\n\n## BSQ Bonding for Roles/Nodes\n\nAll System and Delegable roles described here require the contributor to lock a BSQ bond via a successful DAO vote.\n\nThe oracle node plays a key role in verifying that other bonded roles have a valid, active BSQ bond setup. However, the oracle cannot verify itself or the root seed node (due to a \"chicken and egg\" problem). These root nodes are still required to set up their own BSQ bonds independently.\n\nThe bonding process is transparent. Any user can manually verify the status of bonds for roles/nodes through the DAO section of the Bisq 1 application.\n\n## Confiscation of BSQ Bonds\n\nIf a contributor operating a bonded role acts maliciously or harmfully, any community member can propose the confiscation of their BSQ bond.\n\nThe confiscation process is as follows:\n\n1. A user posts a proposal on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository], detailing the harmful behavior and rationale for confiscation.\n2. The proposal is discussed publicly, allowing the bondholder an opportunity to respond.\n3. If rough consensus for confiscation is reached, the user requesting confiscation creates a formal \"Confiscate Bond Proposal\" in the Bisq 1 application.\n4. The proposal is submitted to the DAO for stakeholder voting.\n5. If the vote passes (meeting high thresholds detailed below), the bond is burned (destroyed), the role is unregistered, and the contributor loses their bond and ceases performing the role. If rejected, no action is taken.\n\nConfiscating a bond is a significant penalty reserved for serious offenses. To prevent misuse, the DAO requires exceptionally high support for confiscation proposals:\n* Minimum Quorum: 200,000 BSQ participating in the vote.\n* Minimum Acceptance: 85% approval (compared to >50% for typical proposals).\n\nThis system minimizes the risk of misbehavior in high-trust roles while providing a community-driven mechanism for accountability.

{"title": "Bisq Easy", "content": "Bisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2, designed to facilitate the acquisition of bitcoin with zero trade fees and without the requirement of a security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol intended for novice bitcoin buyers seeking a non-KYC option and aiming to be efficiently onboarded by experienced and knowledgeable sellers that are familiar with the Bisq platform.\n\nBisq Easy is currently the only trade protocol for Bisq 2. More trade protocols are planned for the future.\n\n## Bisq Easy Trade Protocol Specifics\n\n## = Trade fees\n=\n\nThere are no trade fees for buyers or sellers for trading on Bisq Easy.\n\n## = Mining fees\n=\n\nBuyers will not have to pay any mining fees when they trade on Bisq Easy.\n\nSellers will need to pay any fees required to send the bitcoin to the buyer after receiving their payment. For on chain transactions the seller is responsible for paying mining fees needed to send the bitcoin to the buyer's waller. For lighting transactions the seller is responsible for paying any routing fees needed to pay the buyer's ln invoice.\n\n## = Security mechanisms\n=\n\nThe security of the trade is proportional to the reputation of the seller.\n\nAs Bisq Easy is reputation based, and reputation provides a fairly low security model, it means traders on Bisq Easy are suited only to rather small amounts of bitcoin.\n\nBy default buyers can only exchange messages with sellers that have a certain level of reputation, however, buyers can opt-out from that protection.\n\nTrading with sellers without reputation, or very low reputation, carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.\n\n## = Currencies / Payment Methods\n=\n\nBisq Easy buyers and sellers can trade bitcoin for any type of fiat.\n\nFiat buyers and sellers can choose whatever type of payment method they agree upon for fiat transfer.\n\n## = Dispute mechanisms\n=\n\nBuyers and sellers trading on Bisq Easy can access mediation support should anything go wrong with their trade.\n\nMediators will be able to:\n\n* Help facilitate the successful completion of the trade\n* Confirm fiat / altcoin and bitcoin payments\n* Help cancel trade if needed\n* Report a trader who severely violated the trade rules to the moderator who can ban the user.\n\nDepending on the form of reputation used, a fraudulent seller can get their bonded BSQ confiscated by the DAO or their Bisq 1 onion address banned. As all reputation is linked to the user profile, a banned user profile disables their reputation.\n\n## = Security deposit requirements\n=\n\nBisq Easy trades do not require any security deposits from either the buyer or seller.\n\n## = Privacy benefits / trade-offs\n=\n\nAs no security deposits are required buyers and sellers using fiat will be revealing their bank account details to users that might end up backing out of the trade. If a user backs out of a trade there is less possibility to penalize them than if they had to trade using a security deposit. The seller can report a buyer who cancelled the trade after the payment account data has been transmitted to the moderator, who can ban the buyer.\n\n## Identity\n\nBuyers and sellers on Bisq Easy can create multiple identities.\n\nFind out more about managing your Identity on Bisq 2.\n\n## Reputation\n\nThe security mechanism of Bisq Easy is based on the reputation of the seller. Buyers on Bisq Easy do not need to have a reputation as they will always send the payment first.\n\nFind out more about Reputation for Bisq Easy.\n\n## Using Bisq Easy to buy bitcoin\n\nUsers of Bisq Easy can buy bitcoin using fiat or altcoins with no fees and no security deposits.\n\n## Using Bisq Easy to sell bitcoin\n\nUsers of Bisq Easy can sell bitcoin for fiat or altcoins with no fees and no security deposits.\n\nSellers of Bisq Easy will however have to build up their reputation in order to get buyers.\n\n## How to buy bitcoin on Bisq Easy\n\nBuying Bitcoin with Bisq Easy is recommended for small fiat amounts, or as a starting point if you still have no Bitcoin that you can use for the security deposits of other trade protocols.\n\nYou can opt for two ways to find a trading partner to get some Bitcoin: taking an existing offer or creating one.\n\n## = Creating an offer\n=\nCreating an offer is a great way to establish your own terms and simply wait for someone to match what you are after. It is also the right option if you don't find any offers with the right premium or payment methods in the market you want to trade in. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and create a new offer in it:\n\nBegin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select ''Bisq Easy'' on the left panel, and ''Offerbook'' on the top tab.\n\nframeless\n\nEach different national currency has its own market. You can click on the displayed pair to open a selector where you can choose the currency you would like to trade in. In this example, we are interested in buying some Bitcoin by paying with Euros, so we will select the ''BTC/EUR'' pair, but you should select whatever currency you are using. Afterward, click on the ''Create offer'' button on the right-hand side.\n\nframeless\n\nYou will now enter the offer creation wizard. The first step will be to choose between buying or selling Bitcoin. Select ''Buy Bitcoin'' and click on ''Next''.\n\nframeless\n\nOn the following screen, you will be asked for confirmation on which currency you want to pay your Bitcoin with. The selected currency will be the one you selected in the previous ''Offerbook'' screen. You can change your mind here if needed. Since for this example we want to move forward with Euros, we don't need to change anything on this screen, and we can simply click ''Next''.\n\nframeless\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods are you willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select ''SEPA'' and ''Revolut''.\n\nframeless\n\nBesides the presented Payment Methods, you can also add customized Payment Methods to your offer. For instance, for this offer, I would be happy to make a cash deposit at a Rabobank physical branch. I can use the bottom input to add this method to my offer.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking ''Next''.\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is . You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.\n\nframeless\n\nYou also have the option of defining a range instead of a fixed value for the trade amount. By doing that, you set a minimum and maximum amount, and you signal to the market that you are willing to trade any amount between those two numbers. For this example, we will create an offer with a range between 100€ and 200€. Once you have set your fixed value or a range, click ''Next'' to move on.\n\nframeless\n\nWith this, you will reach the final step of the offer creation wizard. The final screen shows a summary of all the details you have defined. Now is the time for you to review whether everything is fine. This is important because, once you click on ''Create offer'', the offer will be available for anyone to take and, once that happens, it will be binding. So, make sure you are happy with the details you see. Once you are sure, click on ''Create offer'' and your offer will be added to the market.\n\nframeless\n\nYour order is finally ready. Now, you will have to wait until another peer takes it. If your offer remains unpicked for longer than you would like to, consider modifying it to add additional payment methods or adding a more flexible range of values that could attract different users.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce a peer takes your offer, you will receive a notification and be able to see the started trade in the ''Open Trades'' panel of Bisq Easy. Also, keep in mind that offers remain open until you close them. If you only want to transact once, you should close it after it gets taken, or more peers could keep taking it!\n\n## = Taking an offer\n=\n\nTaking an existing offer is the fastest and simplest way to find a partner and start trading. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and pick an existing offer in it.\n\nBegin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select ''Bisq Easy'' on the left panel, and ''Getting started'' on the top tab.\n\nframeless\n\nOn this page, click on the ''Start trade wizard''. This is the easiest way to get started. A small note: once you become more experienced, you might prefer to use the ''Offerbook'' page to do your trades. But for the first trades, we advise using the trade wizard.\n\nframeless\n\nWith this, you will enter the trade wizard, which will guide you step by step through the process of taking an existing offer to buy some Bitcoin. In the first screen, select ''Buy Bitcoin'' and click on ''Next''.\n\nframeless\n\nIn the following screen, you need to indicate which national currency you want to use to pay your trading partner. Since we want to use Euros for this trade, we select that currency in the list. Once you have selected your currency, click on ''Next'' to move on.\n\nframeless\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods you are willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select ''SEPA'' and ''Revolut''.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking ''Next''.\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell.

We set the value and click on ''Next'' to move on.\n\nIn the following screen, you will be presented a list of offers that match your needs. You can select any of the offers presented, but we advise taking the first offer. By default, offers will be presented by decreasing reputation, so the most trusted trades will be on the top of the list. You can check other offers that might have more interesting prices, but be aware that the lower the reputation of the trader, the higher the risk you will face. If you want to keep things safe and simple, simply pick the first offer that you see. Once you have settled for an offer, click on ''Next'' to move on.\n\nframeless\n\nThe final screen will allow you to review all the details. Make sure you are happy with all the details of the trade, since once you move on, you will effectively commit to doing the trade. If there's anything you want to change, you can always navigate back and modify any of the trade details. Once you are ready, click on ''Confirm trade''.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce you have done this, the offer is taken and you can begin the trade process. You can read more about the trade process here: Trade Process.\n\nRemember that when you take an offer, you commit to follow through. Be aware that, once you take it, you can't simply back down without consequences.\n\nNote that there is also a chance that no offers are found matching your needs. If this is the case, you will see a screen like the one below. You can wait some time and try again later, or you can instead create your own offer.

It is expected they will be helpful and supportive to buyers who are new to Bitcoin and/or Bisq. Bisq Easy seller's should be passionate about helping new Bisq users smoothly acquire no KYC bitcoin in a peer to peer manner.\n\nAs building reputation incurs costs for the bitcoin sellers. It is expected that they will sell bitcoin at a premium of about 10-15%. The premium reflects the additional costs and compensates sellers for the on-boarding service they provide.\n\n## Trade Process\n\nTrade process for Bisq Easy is as follows:\n\n* The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker's user profile.\n* Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.\n* The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.\n* The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the seller's account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.\n* Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyer's address.\n* After the buyer receives the Bitcoin the trade is completed.\n\n## Trade Rules\n\nBisq Easy trading rules are as follows:\n\n* Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.\n* After the payment details are exchanged, not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.\n* When sending the Fiat, the buyer MUST fill in the payment reason field with the Trade ID string, which can be found under Bisq Easy > MY OPEN TRADES (this is to prevent triangle scams), and MUST NOT use any term related to 'Bitcoin', 'Bisq' or 'Trade'.\n* If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.\n* If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the Matrix channel.\n\n## Chat Rules\n\nBisq Easy has the following chat rules it expects traders to follow:\n\n* Be respectful: Always treat others with kindness and respect. Avoid offensive language, personal attacks, and harassment. Remember that behind every screen is a real person with feelings.\n* No spamming: Please refrain from flooding the chat with repetitive or irrelevant messages.

Failure to comply may result in warnings, temporary mute, or ban from the Bisq network.\n\n## How to stay safe on Bisq Easy\n\nHere are some tips for keeping safe when trading on Bisq Easy and avoiding any scams.\n\n## = Tips for bitcoin buyers\n=\n\nBitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before sending any bitcoin. For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.\n\n# Start with a small amount as a test trade\n# Start chatting with the seller before sending the fiat payment to check that they are still active\n# Choose a seller with a high reputation. The higher the reputation of the seller the better. Sellers need a minimum reputation score of 30,000, ideally you should be choosing to trade with someone higher than this. Look at the star system for guidance. It will be safer to trade with a 5 star rated seller than a 1 star rated seller.\n# Send payment as soon as possible once you have the seller's account details.\n# Only send payment to the account details provided by the Seller in the trade chat window. If the seller is trying to change the account they want you to send payment to, it would be better to cancel the trade and open a new trade with another seller.\n# Place the trade ID from Bisq Easy in the payment reason.\n# Send the payment from the same account you share the information with in trader chat. For example if you are having problems with the payment do not send payment from your partners, business, friends etc account. Instead try and resolve the issue so you can send payment from the correct account and failing that open mediation to get additional support.\n# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the seller via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.\n# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.\n\n## = Tips for bitcoin sellers\n=\n\nAlthough bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before bitcoin sellers send them any bitcoin, sellers should still be aware of buyers attempting any charge-back scams. There is almost no cost for a bitcoin buyer to create an account and start making trades, therefore, there is little for a buyer to lose by attempting a scam. Almost all buyers on Bisq Easy will be honest but it is still good to be cautious.\n\nFor this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.\n\n# Be careful when dealing with buyers with brand new accounts (the buyer's account age is shown in their profile).\n# Avoid payment methods that have a high possibility of charge-backs eg; PayPal, Venmo\n# Make sure the payment you receive matches the buyers account details. Avoid sending bitcoin to buyer's with mis-matching account details. It would be better to refund the payment to the account you received the payment from and cancel the trade.\n# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the buyer via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.\n# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.\n# If you have any concerns about a trade open mediation.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Contributor privacy and opsec", "content": "First of all: Bitcoin is good for you and the rest of the world, and dealing with Bitcoin is, in itself, perfectly fine and natural. This means that when you privately trade on Bisq, you are most probably doing nothing wrong, on the contrary you are furthering the ideals Bitcoin was created for, even if someone might try to convince you otherwise.\n\nThere are parties though that would rather have Bitcoin either disappear, or be turned into the ultimate mass-control tool (the latter being a very realistic scenario, given the peculiarities of the blockchain and its workings). This might, in turn, lead these parties to act in such a way that Bitcoin itself doesn't prosper, or projects around it disappear completely.\n\nThis is not an advanced privacy/anonymity guide, but is rather tailored to Bisq contributors and their selective need for pseudonymity, which should not impact too much on convenience unless they cover very sensitive roles (in which case they are already prepared on the matter of personal security, and do not really need this guide anyway).\n\nBisq contributors, as key elements for Bisq's well being, might be among targeted individuals, and for this, other than for best practices regarding privacy on the internet, it is advisable they act accordingly, first and foremost for their own safety, and then for Bisq's.\n\nThe aim of this guide is containerization, which means that a ''contributor'' will appear to an ''adversary'' (someone trying to understand who you really are, to do bad things to you) as a specific individual, traceable online as ''contributor'', but hopefully (if you do things well enough) not linkable to their real identity, nor to other possible nyms ''contributor'' uses while participating in other projects.\nIn other words, ''adversary'' will be able to tell if something on the internet has been said by ''contributor'', but it should not make them any wiser about who ''contributor'' really is, where they live, or which other works they have done for other initiatives.\nWe will be making Tor Browser work as a much more convenient, much less privacy hardened browser, that will still force you to connect through Tor to do whatever you need; in other words, we will use Tor Browser in a way that it is NOT intended to be used. An adversary will be able to fingerprint you as a nym, but they won't find details to locate your real identity if you are careful; the previous statement will not be liked by enthusiasts of online privacy, but a mild yet consistent plan, is still much better than a very strong plan that is not adhered to 100% of the time because it is very unconvenient.\n\nLet's clear up some definitions:\n* privacy is when someone knows who you are, but not what you do\n* anonymity is when someone knows what you do, but not who you are\n* pseudonymity is when someone knows \"who\" you are and what you do, but the \"who\" is an imaginary identity that exists only in its own reality, without any ties to your real or alternative identities\n\nFor more info:\n* https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/pseudonymity-guide\n* https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html\n\n= Tenets =\n\n* I will have a Bisq nym, that will be the only one used for everything related to Bisq\n* My Bisq nym will be its own person, it will not be similar to, know about the existence of, or participate in the same chats/groups/forums/activities as my real or alternative identities\n* I will only use Tor for everything the Bisq nym does\n* I will endure the slowness of Tor, and will NOT use my real connection nor my faster VPN to do Bisq stuff\n\n= Steps for base setup =\n\n* download Tor Browser for your OS\n* have Tor Browser \"installed\" (actually it is just uncompressed in a folder with no ties to registry or system config) in a path that's unique to your Bisq nym\n* run Tor Browser (ignore the error about restarting Tor if there is another Tor Browser open, as they will try to bind the same ports, returning an error, and close the popup) and open about:config in the URL bar, say that you really want to access the options, then search for _port\n* you want to edit network.proxy.socks_port and extensions.torlauncher.control_port, the standard values here are respectively 9150 and 9151 (standalone tor daemon is 9050 and 9051), so you can change them to 9250 and 9251, or increase them to 9350 and 9351 if you want several Tor Browser instances running at the same time (this will run a dedicated Tor circuit builder for your Bisq activity)\n* still in about:config, search for \"privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing\" and set it to false (allows maximizing pages to fill the whole screen)\n* close Tor Browser and restart it (right after this, it's a good time to enable the automatic connection, which means Tor Browser will build a Tor circuit right after you start it)\n* go to geolocation.com in Tor Browser, verify the IP and location is different from your real ones (it will necessarily be, this is just to show you where you appear to be coming from, when using Tor) and from the one reported from any other Tor Browser you maybe already have on the system\n* make sure the shield icon in top right is empty (clicking on it says \"standard\"); this will enable scripts, which are not \"safe\" for anonymity, but you want a bit of convenience to be able to use Matrix and other websites that require javascript, as long as all activity in this browser stays within your Bisq nym\n* go to settings > privacy, and under \"history\" disable \"always use private browsing\", this will restart Tor Browser; after restart, return to same settings, disable cookie deletion after Tor Browser closes (so you can log back in to websites automatically), enable all logins&passwords saving, and under history enable what suits you (enable both \"remember\" for maximum convenience), then under Permissions, block requests to access camera and location. Even if you don't disable mic access, the microphone will still be unavailable during web calls, because of a compile-time setting of Tor Browser.\n\n## Tips\n\n* sometimes Tor will become slow, really, unbearably torturing slow; stay strong, don't go clearnet; if all else fails, blame Tor with your correspondents, it will immediately excuse you for your unresponsiveness, and at the same time show you are very privacy-oriented and make you look really cool\n* the usual tip to leave the tor browser window at default size is not really needed here, as we are okay with \"fingerprinting\" the nym\n* sometimes the Tor connection will degrade to a point where it's not useable, and you need to create a new Tor circuit; do NOT, EVER click \"New Identity\" to do this, or you will lose every personalization (pinned tabs and history mainly), rather close Tor Browser and restart it\n\n= Known issues and warnings =\n\n* real anonymity does not exist, even if you could \"plug\" into the internet like rebels plugged into the Matrix, someone could still be able to trace the source of your \"signal\"; proper personal protection can be achieved based on one's dedication and skills, and always relative to one's threat model (a Bisq contributor shouldn't get the same attention that a whistleblower does, for example)\n* it only takes one mistake, where you let a hint to your real identity slip through your pseudonym, and your whole nym is compromised, plus all of their past activity will be linked to you\n* assume any online service will keep all the information about you that you allow it to obtain (browser/PC information via javascript, OS preferred language, obviously your IP, cookies...) and store them for the long term even after you think you deleted them\n* assume that anything you do, say, or write, will be used against you, even if it was innocent and apparently inconsequential at the time\n* in the above configuration, Tor Browser loses most of its specific privacy strengths, yet it's still very useful to have a portable, containerized browser that will only work through Tor, and builds its own Tor connection, distinct from any other Tor daemon you maybe have on your system (versus, for example, using several chromium instances tied to the same Tor proxy, which will all use the same entry and exit node, and which will be at risk of going on clearnet if for any reason the plugin you use to proxy through Tor doesn't do its job)\n* this guide is only aimed at online protection, offering nothing in the compartment of offline security: anyone physically accessing your PC will be able to tell that you are, in fact, ''contributor'', plus any other identity you might have used online, unless you also hardened your system with additional layers that will not be covered in this guide, at least for now (see Tails, Qubes, Whonix, or any other renowned tool for PC protection)\n\n= Steps for accounts setup =\nAs a Bisq contributor, you will need at minimum a GitHub account, to be able to publish Compensation Requests. A GitHub account requires an email address, so you will need that one as well.\nProtonmail is one email provider that will let you register -as of now- without any KYC elements (no other email addresses nor phone numbers needed); riseup.net also offers no-kyc email, but you need an invite by another user; in case you know of similar services, please notify us and we will gladly add them in this guide.\nAn account on matrix is also advised to access Bisq's space, you will register from https://bisq.chat and use the same email to associate to that account, registering at https://bisq.community is needed to interact with the forum.\nAn interesting customization can be to obtain an AI generated face to associate with your account, there are many services that let you get such a picture for free.\n\n= Burning Men considerations =\n\nIf a Bisq contributor wants to become act as one of the Burning Ben they will have additional privacy and opsec considerations.\n\n* BSQ is inherently less private than bitcoin. BSQ can easily be traced back to a compensation request, DAO vote.\n* Bitcoin accumulated from performing the role of a burning man also links it to a specific burning man address.\n\nBoth of the above points should be considered by contributors concerned about privacy and opsec.", "category": "bisq2"}

Dispute resolution in Bisq 2 varies depending on the trade protocol that was used.\n\nMost issues on Bisq are minor and easily resolved when traders communicate with each other. Mediation is intended to resolve the vast majority of remaining issues.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Trade Protocols =\nBisq 2 will offer users the choice of multiple trade protocols. A trade protocol serves as the fundamental framework for trading Bitcoin in a secure way. Each trade protocol presents its own set of advantages and trade-offs, including:\n\n* Security mechanisms\n* Dispute mechanisms\n* Security deposit requirements\n\nBisq 2 offers users the flexibility to select the optimal protocol aligning with their requirements and preferences. All trade protocols will be accessible from the Bisq 2 application independently. Users will be able to switch between trade protocols for different trades should they wish.\n\n## Bisq Easy\n\nBisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2, designed to facilitate the acquisition of bitcoin with zero trade fees and without the requirement of a security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol intended for novice bitcoin buyers seeking a non-KYC option and aiming to be efficiently onboarded by experienced and knowledgeable sellers that are familiar with the Bisq platform.\n\nSecurity mechanisms: Reputation\nDispute mechanisms: Trade Chat and Mediation (for Bisq Easy)\n\n= Dispute Options =\nThe options available for dispute resolution in Bisq 2 vary depending on the trade protocol that was used. The various dispute resolution mechanisms available in Bisq 2 include:\n\n## Trade Chat\n\nIf you're having any issues completing a trade, or if you just want to keep your counterparty informed (e.g., in case you're delayed completing your end of the deal), you can send your counterparty a message through Bisq's end-to-end encrypted chat mechanism. This allows traders to communicate with each other throughout the course of a trade to resolve potential trade issues quickly without involving a third party like a mediator.\n\n## Mediation in Bisq Easy\n\nMediation is available within Bisq Easy at any time. You can initiate it by selecting the 'request mediation' link on the trade screen. A mediator will then join the trade chat and gather information to assist as much as possible. Since Bisq Easy trades do not require a security deposit, the mediator's abilities are somewhat limited. However, they can still provide valuable assistance and, if necessary, ban traders.\n\n=If all else fails=\nOne advantage of a flat, decentralized governance structure that encourages user involvement is that no user should ever feel hindered from receiving a fair trade outcome because of a single individual's decision. Bisq isn't a black-box corporation with inscrutable processes. It's an open software project that is governed openly.\n\nTherefore, for whatever reason, if the process above doesn't work for you, you can make a make a reimbursement request yourself in the Bisq DAO. **The Bisq DAO, not any single individual, is the ultimate arbiter of policy and decision-making for all things Bisq.**", "category": "bisq2"}

Most exchanges are centralized exchanges running on servers controlled by the exchange. Bisq is decentralized, running only on the desktops of Bisq users.\n\nBisq manages offers to trade using a peer-to-peer network. This is a global network made of users who are also running Bisq on their own computers.\n\nCentralized services are easy to monitor, block, and shut down, while peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, Bitcoin and Bisq are difficult to surveil, censor, shut down or hack.\n\nAll of this means that if you want to use the Bisq network, you must download and run the software on your own machine.\n\n## Download Bisq\n\nThe most convenient way to install Bisq on your machine is from a pre-built install file from the [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Bisq website] or [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest latest GitHub release].\n\nThere's also a community-maintained [https://snapcraft.io/bisq-desktop Snap package] for various Linux distributions.\n\nYou can download the installer for your operating system and install Bisq right away, but we strongly recommend that you verify the integrity of your installer file first.\n\n**If you have issues, please check the ''Known issues with installation'' section in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest release notes].**\n\n## Verify installer file\n\n## = Bisq2 specific instructions\n=\n\nBisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.\n\nUsually, installation binaries are signed by Alejandro García (key ID: E222AA02, primary release manager). However, since this key has expired — and the expired key was included in previous versions of the Bisq2 app — the in-app verification process would fail when attempting to download version 2.1.2. To prevent this issue, the secondary release manager assumed responsibility for signing that release. The signingkey.asc file specifies the key used for signing the binaries.\n\nHenrikJannsen's signing key can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc here] (full fingerprint: B8A5 D214 ADFA A387 A14C 8BCF 02AA 2BAE 387C 8307).\n\nTo import the key in Linux and MacOS:\n\ncurl https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc | gpg --import\n\nGPG will return \"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\", this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)\n\nTo verify the installer against the signature:\n\ngpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}\n\nReplace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.\n\nIn Windows. you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].\n\nAny software that manages funds, signs transactions, and deals with highly sensitive data is a prime target for malware. Bisq does all three. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you verify the integrity of the installer file you use to install Bisq.\n\nThis verification is something that you should do for the initial Bisq install. After the initial install, you will be prompted to install updates through Bisq's interface. The Bisq software will verify the integrity of updates for you.\n\nBisq installer files are currently built and signed by Alejandro Garcia (alejandrogarcia83).

{"title": "Funding your wallet", "content": "Before trading on Bisq, it's necessary to **fund your wallet** with bitcoin. This is because making and taking offers on Bisq requires traders to post a security deposit and pay fees with bitcoin.\n\nPosting bitcoin security deposits in a 2of2 multisignature address is part of what makes trading on Bisq highly secure.\n\n## Security Deposit Requirements\n\n\nYou can see the required deposits for an offer by clicking on the i icon for an offer. You'll see a pop-up appear. On the bottom of this pop-up will be a Details section with a Security Deposit line.\n\nframeless|left|600px\n\n## = For Buyers\n=\n\nBuyers need to post a deposit of at least 15% of the trade amount, with an absolute minimum of 0.001 BTC. The maximum possible deposit for a buyer is 50% of the trade amount. The offer maker sets this percentage when creating an offer.\n\n## = For Sellers\n=\n\nSellers need to post a deposit of 15% of the trade amount with an absolute minimum of 0.001 BTC (in addition to 100% of the bitcoin being sold). As of this writing, the security deposit percentage for sellers cannot be adjusted.\n\n## = Notes for Buyers and Sellers\n=\n\nIf the size of an offer is a range, the required security deposit is calculated according to the maximum possible trade size. Example: if the buyer's deposit is set to 20% for an offer with a 0.05-0.10 BTC trade size, the buyer will need to post a 0.02 BTC security deposit. The seller would need to post a deposit of 0.015 BTC (for a total deposit of 0.115 BTC, since they'd also have to post the entire ''possible'' trade amount).\n\n## How to Obtain Your First Bitcoin\n\n\nIf you don’t already own any bitcoin, you’ll need to obtain some—ideally, as privately and securely as possible.\n\nHow much do you need? In addition to covering a security deposit (as described above), traders also need to cover mining fees and trading fees. Estimates for both are shown in the interface when making or taking an offer. As of this writing, a safe estimate for buying your first bitcoin on Bisq with fiat is **0.002 BTC**.\n\nHere are some ideas for how to do that.\n\nthumb|right|A graphical overview of how to get your first bitcoin privately.\n\n* **Bisq Easy**. Bisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2 that allows users to buy bitcoin with no trade fees and no security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol. It is meant for bitcoin buyers with limited experience using peer to peer software to purchase no KYC bitcoin and to be smoothly on-boarded by experienced and helpful bitcoin sellers.\n* **Matrix room**. Bisq's Matrix chat offers a Get your first BTC room for trusted and bonded Bisq users to sell first-time Bisq users their first BTC so they can use Bisq.\n* **Friends and family**. Simply buy a small amount of bitcoin directly from someone you trust.\n* **Bitcoin ATM**. Some bitcoin ATMs don't require ID for smaller purchases, and some don't require any ID at all. You can find bitcoin ATMs in your area on [https://coinatmradar.com/ Coin ATM Radar].\n* **Sell something**. Do you offer a product or service? Use BTCPayServer to collect BTC for it! Otherwise don't forget about local marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace—many people are willing to buy and sell everyday goods for BTC.\n* **Work for it**. While sites to find gigs that pay in bitcoin never really panned out, it may not hurt to let a client or business contact know that you also accept bitcoin for payment.\n* **Meetups**. People at bitcoin meetups might have bitcoin. Crazy, right? Find out where and when they take place on Meetup, Twitter, and other places where people talk about bitcoin.\n* **Vouchers**. Companies like [https://fastbitcoins.com/ Fastbitcoins.com] and [https://azte.co/ Azte.co] may sell vouchers at physical stores in your area for cash. There aren't a whole lot of locations yet, but more are being added all the time.\n\nIt's highly recommended that you avoid using a corporate, centralized exchange to get your first bitcoin. Most such exchanges (like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc) require a significant amount of personal information, putting you at risk by tying your identity to your bitcoin (as well as by storing all this information in databases with that of others, forming what are commonly referred to as \"honeypots\"—highly attractive targets for hackers). Also, since bitcoin transactions are public and easily traceable, any future transactions involving bitcoin purchased with these services can be traced back to you.\n\nBisq is built from the ground up to avoid this privacy fiasco, so we strongly recommend avoiding centralized exchanges.\n\n## Sending Bitcoin to your Bisq wallet\n\nOnce you’ve gotten enough bitcoin for your security deposit and fees, you can move it into Bisq’s built-in wallet. This isn’t strictly required, but it’ll make trading more convenient since the funds you need to accept an offer will be readily available when you need them.\n\nTo send bitcoin to your Bisq wallet, you'll need an address. You'll find one on Funds > Receive Funds.\n\nYou might see many addresses listed. Pick the address on the bottom next to the QR code.\n\n600px|thumb|left|Find your Bisq wallet's receiving address.\nCheck or uncheck ''Native segwit format (Bech32)'' to receive funds to a legacy address.\n\nCategory:Use Cases", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "How to do arbitrage on Bisq", "content": "**Arbitrage** is the practice of simultaneously buying and selling an asset in different markets (or in different forms within the same market) to profit from a temporary price difference. In inefficient or less liquid markets, like many peer-to-peer environments, arbitrage opportunities can arise more frequently.\n\nArbitrageurs play a necessary role by taking advantage of these inefficiencies. In doing so, they not only profit but also help improve market liquidity and price discovery, making the market more efficient for everyone. Bisq currently provides many arbitrage opportunities.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Types of Arbitrage on Bisq\n\nYou can perform two main types of arbitrage involving Bisq:\n\n## = Inter-Exchange Arbitrage\n=\n\nThis involves finding price differences between Bisq and another exchange or market (Market X).\n\n**Example:**\n# You observe that the lowest price to **SELL** Bitcoin on Bisq's EUR/BTC market is currently **€85,500**.\n# Simultaneously, you find you can **BUY** Bitcoin on Market X (e.g., a centralized exchange) for **€85,100**.\n# You execute both trades at roughly the same time: **Buy** 1 BTC on Market X for €85,100 and **Sell** 1 BTC on Bisq for €85,500.\n# Assuming successful execution, this yields a potential profit of **€400** per BTC, **before** accounting for any fees (trading, withdrawal, mining, payment method).\n\n(The reverse is also possible: buying cheaper on Bisq and selling higher elsewhere).\n\n## = Intra-Exchange Arbitrage\n=\n\nThis involves exploiting price differences *within* the Bisq platform itself. This can happen between different currency markets or different payment methods within the same currency market.\n\n##\nCross-Currency Arbitrage\n##\n\nIf the implied cross-rate between two fiat currencies (e.g., USD and EUR) differs from the prevailing market rate, an opportunity might exist.\n\n**Example:**\n# You notice the relative price in Bisq's USD/BTC market (e.g., equivalent to €86,000) is higher than in Bisq's EUR/BTC market (e.g., €85,000).\n# You simultaneously **SELL** BTC for USD (at the higher relative price) and **BUY** BTC for EUR (at the lower relative price) on Bisq.\n# If done correctly with sufficient volume, you can lock in a profit based on the temporary price discrepancy between the two Bisq markets (factoring in fees and the actual EUR/USD exchange rate).\n# Repeat as long as the profitable spread exists.\n\n##\nPayment Method Arbitrage\n##\n\nDifferent payment methods within the same currency market (e.g., EUR) might have different prices due to varying user preferences, risks, or settlement times associated with those methods.\n\n**Example:**\n# You see offers available to **BUY** Bitcoin using SEPA priced relatively low (e.g., at €85,200).\n# At the same time, you see offers available to **SELL** Bitcoin receiving payment via Revolut priced higher (e.g., at €85,800).\n# You simultaneously execute both: **BUY** 1 BTC using SEPA for €85,200 and **SELL** 1 BTC receiving Revolut for €85,800.\n# This yields a potential profit of **€600** per BTC arbitraged between the two payment methods on Bisq, **before** accounting for fees.\n# Repeat as long as the profitable spread exists.\n\n## Risks and Considerations\n\nWhile arbitrage aims to be low-risk by locking in profits from existing price differences, several practical factors introduce risk and complexity, especially on a P2P platform like Bisq:\n\n* **Execution Risk:** Prices can change quickly. Delay in executing one leg of the arbitrage (e.g., your external market buy fills but your Bisq sell offer gets taken by someone else before you can place it, or vice-versa) can erase the profit or lead to a loss. Getting both sides filled simultaneously at the desired prices can be challenging.\n* **Fees:** Remember to account for all fees:\n* Bisq trading fees (maker/taker, paid in BTC or BSQ).\n* Bitcoin mining fees (for deposit and payout transactions in Bisq v1).\n* Fees associated with the specific payment methods used (both on Bisq and external exchanges).\n* Fees on the external exchange (Market X).\n* **Capital Requirements:** You need sufficient capital available on both platforms/payment methods simultaneously to execute both legs of the trade (BTC and/or fiat).\n* **Counterparty Risk (Bisq v1):** While security deposits mitigate risk, trades can still go to dispute resolution, potentially tying up your funds (including deposits) for some time. Ensure you understand the risks associated with the specific payment methods and trade protocol.\n* **Settlement Times:** Fiat payment methods have varying settlement times. An arbitrage might require managing cash flow across methods that settle at different speeds.\n\nSuccessful arbitrage requires careful calculation, quick execution, and a good understanding of the platforms and payment methods involved.\n\n*For more short guides see Howto.

{"title": "How to run pricenode", "content": "A **Bisq Pricenode** is a service that provides essential market data to Bisq clients. It fetches cryptocurrency exchange rates (e.g., BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) and Bitcoin network mining fee estimations from various external providers and relays this aggregated data to Bisq users upon request.\n\nPricenodes run as Tor hidden services. This allows Bisq clients to retrieve price and fee data without revealing their IP address or connecting outside the Tor network, thus preserving user privacy.\n\nWhile anyone with the technical capability can run a pricenode for personal use (e.g., configuring their client via command-line arguments), the Bisq application by default connects to a list of nodes run by established, DAO-approved contributors who meet certain reliability standards and are **required to be bonded**.\n\nThe primary source for the pricenode software and technical details is the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-pricenode official GitHub repository]. This guide summarizes the key steps based on that repository.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Overview\n\nThe pricenode software runs a simple HTTP service, typically listening on `localhost:8080`, with key endpoints including:\n* `/getAllMarketPrices`: Returns current BTC exchange rates against various fiat currencies and altcoins.\n* `/getFees`: Returns current estimates for Bitcoin transaction fees (in satoshis/vByte) for different confirmation targets.\n* `/getParams`, `/info`: Provide metadata and status information about the node.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nRunning a pricenode requires a stable environment, typically a server or VPS:\n\n* **Operating System:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu preferred, as automated scripts are available).\n* **Java:** A compatible Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is needed to run the application. (Check the GitHub repository for current version requirements).\n* **Tor:** The `tor` binary must be installed and operational for running as a hidden service.\n* **System Resources:** While not extremely resource-intensive, reliable uptime, sufficient RAM (e.g., 1GB+), disk space (~10GB), and network bandwidth (~1TB/month might be a starting point) are needed. Official requirements may be specified on the Pricenode Operator role page.\n\n## Setup and Installation\n\nThe recommended method for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu is the automated install script. Advanced users or those on other systems can build from source.\n\n## = Method 1: Installation Script (Recommended for Debian/Ubuntu)\n=\nThis script automates the installation of dependencies, building the software, configuring the Tor hidden service, and setting up the pricenode to run as a system service.\n# Ensure `curl` and `sudo` are available: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl`\n# Run the installer script:\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bisq-network/bisq-pricenode/main/scripts/install_pricenode_debian.sh | sudo bash\n# Follow any prompts from the script.\n# **Important:** At the end of the script, it should output your node's unique **Tor `.onion` address**. Record this address carefully, especially if you plan to use the node yourself or apply to become a default operator. You will also need to back up the hidden service's private key (`/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/private_key` or similar, depending on Tor setup).\n\n## = Method 2: Build from Source\n=\nThis method requires manual setup of dependencies and Tor configuration.\n# Install Git and a compatible JDK. (Check the GitHub repository for current version requirements).\n# Clone the repository (including submodules):\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-pricenode.git\ncd bisq-pricenode\n# Build the application using Gradle:\n./gradlew clean build\n# Manually configure Tor to create a hidden service that points to the pricenode's listening port (default 8080). Consult the official Tor documentation for setting up onion services.\n# Determine how to run the built Java application persistently (e.g., using `screen`, `tmux`, or creating your own `systemd` service).\n\n## Running and Managing\n\nIf you used the installation script (Method 1), the pricenode should be running as a `systemd` service named `bisq-pricenode`. You can manage it with standard commands:\n* Check Status: `sudo systemctl status bisq-pricenode`\n* Stop Service: `sudo systemctl stop bisq-pricenode`\n* Start Service: `sudo systemctl start bisq-pricenode`\n* Restart Service: `sudo systemctl restart bisq-pricenode`\n* View Logs (live): `journalctl -u bisq-pricenode -f`\n\nIf you built from source (Method 2), you are responsible for starting, stopping, and managing the Java process using your chosen method (e.g., `screen`, `tmux`, manual execution).\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can test if your node is running correctly by querying its endpoints using `curl` or a similar tool.\n\n* **Locally (if installed via script):**\nCheck if the node is responding on the default local port:\ncurl http://localhost:8080/getAllMarketPrices\ncurl http://localhost:8080/getFees\n\n* **Over Tor (replace with your node's address):**\nUse `torsocks` (or configure Tor as a system proxy) to query your node's `.onion` address (replace `YOUR_ONION_ADDRESS.onion` with the actual address):\ntorsocks curl http://YOUR_ONION_ADDRESS.onion/getAllMarketPrices\ntorsocks curl http://YOUR_ONION_ADDRESS.onion/getFees\n\nSuccessful queries should return JSON formatted data containing price and fee information.\n\n## Becoming a Default Operator\n\nRunning a pricenode doesn't automatically make it used by other Bisq clients. To become one of the default nodes hardcoded in the Bisq software, you generally need to:\n# Apply for the Pricenode Operator role.\n# Gain DAO approval through voting.\n# Set up the required BSQ bond (currently **10,000 BSQ**).\n# Meet reliability and uptime standards.\n# Set up mandatory monitoring systems.\n\nContact current maintainers or check the `#pricenode` channel on Matrix/Discord for details on the current application process.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nOperators whose nodes are included in the default list within Bisq releases are required to set up monitoring using `collectd` and provide network size data. This involves running additional setup scripts found in the GitHub repository's README ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-pricenode#monitoring see Monitoring section]) and coordinating with the Bisq monitoring team.\n\n## Compensation\n\nApproved Pricenode Operators who maintain reliable nodes included in the default list can request compensation from the Bisq DAO for their service and hosting costs.\n* The current compensation rate is **130 USD per DAO cycle** (paid in BSQ).\n* The significant initial effort for setting up the node, Tor, monitoring, and the bonding process may also be justifiable for a one-time setup compensation request.\n\nCategory:Guides\nCategory:Infrastructure\nCategory:Technical\nCategory:Roles\nCategory:DAO", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Identity", "content": "Bisq 2 users are able to manage multiple identities for their trades.\n\nAt Bisq 2 launch in March 2024, the identities\n\n## What are Identities in Bisq 2\n\nIdentities in Bisq 2 allow users to create multiple identifies that can be totally independent of each other. Each identity in Bisq 2 has it's own unique onion address (this allows for users to receive and broadcast information over the [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor hidden service network]). Each identity will have it's own:\n\n* Username (chosen by the user)\n* Avatar (chosen by the user)\n* Onion address (chosen by the software)\n* Profile ID (chosen by the software)\n\nIn Bisq 1 to achieve multiple identities a user would have to have multiple Bisq instances. With Bisq 2 multiple identities can be created and used via just the one instance of Bisq 2. This allows for easy switching between profiles and having different types of trades, payment methods, protocols utilized by various profiles. This will give users greater control over their privacy\n\n## What Trade Protocols will use Identities\n\nCurrently it will just be Bisq Easy as that is the only available protocol on Bisq 2.\n\n## Building reputation for your Identities\n\nCurrently it will only be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy that will be interested in building up reputation specific to their identity/s. For more information see: reputation.\n\n## Benefits of Identities\n\nThe benefits of being able to have multiple identities means that a user has greater control over their privacy.\n\nA user could have:\n\nProfile 1: Used for buying bitcoin\nProfile 2: Used for selling bitcoin\n\nOR\n\nProfile 1: Used for buying bitcoin with a personal account\nProfile 2: Used for buying bitcoin with a business account\nProfile 3: Used for buying bitcoin with a spouses account\n\nOR\n\nProfile 1: Used for selling bitcoin for Euros\nProfile 2: Used for selling bitcoin for British Pounds\nProfile 3: Used for selling bitcoin for US Dollars\n\nOR\n\nProfile 1: Used for buying bitcoin on Bisq Easy\nProfile 2: Used for atomic swap protocols\n\nAllowing the creation of different multiple identities gives users complete control over what information / data they want to assign to which profile. It is also easy to delete a profile and start a new one at any point.\n\n## Negatives of Identities\n\nReputation built up overtime for bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy is specific to a specific identity. This means that bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will become invested in building up their identities reputation. This is positive for the protocol as a reputation built over time is what gives the protocol it's security mechanism, however for seller's it means that establishing a new identity will have to be done from scratch.\n\nAlthough identities give the user a separate; username, avatar, onion address, an profile ID, it does not prevent a user from mistaken linking their identities by associating their fiat accounts with their separate identities. When creating a new identity the user should be aware of what fiat information they are happy to link to each identity.\n\n## How many identities should you use\n\nIt is entirely up to the user of Bisq 2 to decide how many profiles they will need. It is expected most users will just create the one profile. However the option is there for users that want to create more for privacy or other reasons.\n\n## Creating an Identity\n\nBisq 2 will prompt you to create an identity when you first run the software.\n\nTo create an additional identity click on 'User options' > 'User profile' > 'Create new profile'\n\n## Switching between Identities\n\nIt is easy to switch between identifies by clicking on the profile avatar on the top right of Bisq 2 and selecting the profile (identity) desired. When sending messages be sure to check the correct profile is selected.\n\n## Deleting an Identity\n\nYou can delete an identity by selecting the identity you want to delete and then clicking on 'User options' > 'User profile' > 'delete profile'\n\nYou cannot delete an identity if you only have one identity.\n\nBe-aware that deleting an identity also deletes any associated reputation it has.", "category": "bisq2"}

{"title": "Reputation", "content": "## Reputation in Bisq Easy\n\nReputation is a cornerstone of the security model in **Bisq Easy**, a Bisq 2 trade protocol. As buyers send their fiat payment ''before'' receiving Bitcoin, the seller's reputation provides the trust needed for the buyer to proceed confidently.\n\n600px|thumb|left|The 'Build reputation' screen in Bisq 2 (accessed via 'Reputation' on the left menu), showing the four methods available.\n\n## = Why Reputation Matters\n=\n\n* **For Buyers:** Carefully review a seller's reputation (shown as stars) before accepting an offer. Choosing sellers with a higher reputation is crucial for minimizing trade risks.\n* **For Sellers:** Building and maintaining a high reputation is essential. It increases buyer trust, makes your offers more attractive, helps you get more trades, and allows you to offer larger trade amounts. Maximizing reputation is key to success as a seller on Bisq Easy. There is expected to be competition among sellers to achieve higher reputation scores.\n\n## = Reputation & Trade Rules (Version 2.1.1 and Later)\n=\n\nStarting with **Bisq 2 version 2.1.1**, several important rules link reputation directly to trading activity (within the currently required software version):\n\n* **Seller's Maximum Trade Amount:** The maximum amount a seller can offer in a single trade now directly depends on their reputation score. Higher reputation allows sellers to create offers for larger amounts.\n* **System Trade Limits:** While a seller's maximum depends on their reputation, the overall limits for ''any'' Bisq Easy trade are fixed between the fiat equivalent of **6 USD** (minimum) and **600 USD** (maximum). This avoids issues with Bitcoin price swings. (Note: Before v2.1.1, limits were 0.0001 - 0.01 BTC).\n* **Enhanced BSQ Value:** To reward commitment and long-term participation, BSQ that is **burned** or **bonded** for reputation now contributes **double its initial value** to the score over the course of the first year (the score increases linearly during that year). This allows sellers to increase their eligible trade limits more quickly.\n* **Minimum Score Setting Removed:** The previous option for buyers to set a specific minimum required reputation score for sellers (formerly defaulted to 30000) was removed in v2.1.1. The system now relies on the direct link between reputation and the allowed trade amount as a better way to handle risk.\n\n400px|thumb|left|General [[Bisq Easy trade limits are 6 USD to 600 USD (or fiat equivalent). A seller's specific maximum offer size within this range depends on their reputation.]]\n400px|thumb|right|Previously, Bisq warned if trading below a set minimum score; this setting was removed in v2.1.1.\n\n## = Understanding Reputation Stars\n=\n\nTo make reputation easy to compare quickly, Bisq Easy displays scores using a simple **0 to 5 star system**.\n\n400px|thumb|left|The star system (0-5) provides an easy comparison of seller reputation based on their current rank among active users. 5 stars indicate the highest relative reputation.\n\n* **How it Works (Relative Ranking):** Your star rating shows how your reputation **compares to all other *active* users** on the Bisq network at that moment. It's your current rank, not a fixed score. The highest-ranked active sellers get 5 stars, the lowest get 0 stars.\n* **Why Stars Change (Dynamic):** Because it's a relative system based on active users, your star rating can change even if your score hasn't:\n:**User Inactivity:** If a user is inactive for **two weeks**, their profile is temporarily excluded from the ranking calculation. If a high-ranked user becomes inactive, others might see their star ratings go up.\n:**User Reactivation:** When an inactive user returns, their reputation is factored back in, potentially shifting star ratings again.\n\n**In short:** Stars give you a quick, dynamic view of a seller's current reputation rank compared to their active peers. The star display will change over time based on both your own score changes and the changing scores of other active users.\n\n## How to Build Reputation\n\nYou can build your reputation score in Bisq Easy using four methods, accessed via the **`Reputation`** section on the main left-hand menu in Bisq 2. Your **total reputation score** is calculated as the **sum** of the points gained from all methods you use. This total score determines your reputation rank (stars) and your maximum trade offer size.\n\nReputation scores can change over time: points from BSQ Bonds are lost when unlocked, but you can burn or bond BSQ repeatedly. You can also import account age or signed account age, potentially replacing previous imported scores if the new import source is older.\n\n## = Method 1: Burning BSQ\n=\n\nYou permanently **burn** BSQ tokens to gain reputation. This represents a strong, long-term commitment to the network, akin to a proof of work. Follow the process displayed in the Bisq 2 Reputation section:\n\n# **Step 1:** Select the user profile in Bisq 2 for which you want to attach the reputation.\n# **Step 2:** Copy the **Profile ID** displayed. You will paste this into Bisq 1.\n# **Step 3:** Open **Bisq 1** and go to `DAO` > `PROOF OF BURN`. Paste the copied Profile ID into the **`pre-image`** field.\n# **Step 4:** Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn.\n# **Step 5:** Publish the Burn BSQ transaction.\n# **Step 6:** After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your Bisq 2 profile.\n\n**Scoring Details:**\n* **Initial Score:** **100 points** per BSQ burned (Weight = 100).\n* **12-Month Bonus:** The score **doubles** over the first year (increasing linearly from 100 to 200 points per BSQ burned). This rewards long-term sellers.\n* **Persistence:** Reputation from burning BSQ is permanent for that profile (unless the profile is banned).\n* **Cumulative:** You can burn BSQ multiple times; scores add up.\n* **Minimum Burn:** 5.46 BSQ (dust limit).\n* **Oracle Publishing:** Data about burned BSQ is automatically published by the oracle.\n\nframe|left|Burning [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ in Bisq 1 requires your Bisq 2 Profile ID as the 'pre-image'.]]\n\n## = Method 2: Bonding BSQ\n=\n\nYou lock up BSQ tokens for a set period (minimum ~1 year) to gain reputation. This is refundable, but shows commitment for the lock duration. Like burning, regular bonding can represent user activity. Follow the process displayed in the Bisq 2 Reputation section:\n\n# **Step 1:** Select the user profile in Bisq 2 for which you want to attach the reputation.\n# **Step 2:** Copy the **Profile ID** displayed. You will paste this into Bisq 1.\n# **Step 3:** Open **Bisq 1** and go to `DAO` > `BONDING` > `BONDED REPUTATION`. Paste the copied Profile ID into the **`salt`** field.\n# **Step 4:** Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lock up and the lock time (minimum **`50000`** blocks).\n# **Step 5:** Publish the lockup transaction.\n# **Step 6:** After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your Bisq 2 profile.\n\n**Scoring Details:**\n* **Initial Score:** **10 points** per BSQ bonded (Weight = 10).\n* **12-Month Bonus:** The score **doubles** over the first year (increasing linearly from 10 to 20 points per BSQ bonded during the lock period).\n* **Persistence:** Reputation lasts only **while the BSQ remains bonded**. You lose these points when you unlock the bond.\n* **Cumulative:** You can create multiple bonds; scores add up while active.\n* **Minimum Lock Time:** 50,000 Bitcoin blocks (approximately 1 year).\n* **Confiscation Risk:** In severe cases (like proven scamming), the Bisq DAO can vote to confiscate (destroy) a user's bond. Confiscating requires high voter turnout (quorum) in the DAO, making it somewhat difficult but possible.\n* **Oracle Publishing:** Data about bonded BSQ is automatically published by the oracle.\n\nframe|left|Bonding [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ in Bisq 1 uses your Bisq 2 Profile ID as the 'salt'.]]\n\n## = Method 3: Importing Bisq 1 Account Age\n=\n\nLeverage the history of your fiat accounts from Bisq 1.

Bisq 2 provides a simulation tool (visible on the 'SCORE' tab for Burning/Bonding/Import methods) to help sellers estimate the reputation score impact of these actions.\n\nFind this tool within the **`Reputation`** section (accessible from the main left-hand menu). It helps visualize the immediate score increase and the potential score after the first year's doubling effect (for BSQ methods) or based on account age.\n\n400px|thumb|left|Simulating the reputation gained from burning [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ.]]\n400px|thumb|right|Simulating the reputation gained from bonding [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ.]]\n\n## What Happens if a Profile is Banned?\n\nIf a user's profile ID (which contains a public key hash tied to reputation) is banned by moderators for severe or repeated violations of Bisq trade protocols, **all reputation associated with that specific profile ID is permanently lost** and becomes unusable.

Banning may also trigger consequences in Bisq 1 (e.g., onion address ban, BSQ bond confiscation proposal via the DAO).", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Reputation2", "content": "Reputation is the security mechanism used for Bisq Easy, a Bisq 2 trade protocol.\n\nBisq Easy does not use security deposits to ensure that trades go smoothly, instead buyers rely on the reputation of the sellers to ensure the trade goes smoothly.\n\nGenerally the higher the sellers reputation on Bisq Easy the higher the likelihood is of the trade being successful, and conversely,\nthe lower the sellers reputation is on Bisq Easy the less the likelihood is of the trade being successful.\n\nBuyers should look to choose sellers with a high reputation for their trades.\n\nSellers should look at how to maximize their reputation to ensure they get more trades.\n\n## Minimum Reputation Score\n\nBisq Easy uses 10,000 as the minimum reputation score.\n\nSeller's with a reputation score of 10,000 or more will be able to have their offers taken from buyers. Seller's that have a reputation score of less than 10,000 will not be able to have their offers taken from buyers.\n\nTraders can change this setting in their Bisq 2 client, but the default minimum reputation score is 10,000.\n\nSeller's wanting to sell bitcoin on Bisq Easy should look to obtain a reputation score of at least 10,000, but preferably higher to compete with the other sellers on the platform.\n\n## Reputation score star system\n\nTo make it easier for user's to compare the reputation scores of different traders, Bisq displays reputation scores as stars (0-5 stars).\n\nTo achieve this users' total reputation scores are compared to other scores in the network and ranked and normalized to a value between 0 and 1.\n\nThe user with the highest ranking will have a value of 5 stars. The user with the lowest ranking will have a value of 0 stars.\n\nThe user profiles only stay for 2 weeks in the network in case a user is not active. Thus their associated reputation will disappear with their profile if being inactive for 2 weeks. This has an impact on the relative reputation score of all other users. For instance if the user with the highest reputation is inactive and gets removed from the network the next user with the highest reputation will become the highest ranked with 5 star. Once a inactive user becomes active again their reputation score will be taken into account in the relative ranking.\n\nOne could phrase it as: The reputation score star system is the relative ranking compared to the reputation of the active users in the network.\n\nframe|left|Bisq converts a seller's reputation score into am easy to view star system. This makes it easy for buyers to see at a glance which are the most reputable sellers. The sellers with the highest reputation have 5 stars and the sellers with the lowest reputation will have 0 stars.\n\n## Why is Reputation important for sellers\n\nBitcoin buyers send the fiat payment to the sellers prior to receiving the bitcoin. Therefore it is important for bitcoin sellers to have a good reputation to help establish trust with their potential trade partners.\n\nIt is expected that users that want to gain reputation to be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will be experienced Bisq users that can provide buyers with a positive experience.\n\nSelling bitcoin on Bisq Easy is expected to be profitable for the sellers in that they will likely choose to sell bitcoin over market price.\n\n## How to build reputation\n\nThere are currently 4 options for creating reputation:\n\n* Burning BSQ\n* Setting up a BSQ bond\n* Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1\n* Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1\n\nThe total score is calculated as sum of the individual reputation sources/events. The reputation scores of users' will change over time due to:\n\n* Reputation gained from bonding BSQ is lost when the bond is unlocked.\n* Users can burn or bond BSQ repeatedly.\n* Users can import signed accounts or aged accounts to replace previous gained reputation scores.\n\nAlso the representation of the reputation as stars next to the user profile will also change over time in respect of the score of other users profile IDs.\n\nIt is expected that there will be some competition between sellers to achieve higher reputation scores to get more trades from bitcoin buyers interested in trading with account with the most reputation.\n\nYou can access all 4 methods of increasing your reputation from the Bisq 2 reputation section found in 'User Options' > 'Reputation'\n\nframe|left\n\n## = Burning BSQ\n=\n\nA user who wants to improve their reputation on the Bisq Easy trade protocol can can burn BSQ.\n\nThe more BSQ that is burned the better the reputation score the user would get.\n\nThe minimum amount of BSQ that can be burnt is 5.46 BSQ (dust limit).\n\nThe value gained by burning BSQ persists over time. Reputation scores achieved from burning BSQ is cumulative. It can be assumed that regular burning (e.g. each week or month) is a form of work and represents activity by the user resulting in a higher reputation score.\n\nData about the burned BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node.\n\nIf a user gets banned by a moderator they will lose the reputation value that they gained from burning the BSQ as the reputation is linked to their profile and a banned profile cannot be used anymore.\n\n**Follow these steps to burn BSQ for reputation:**\n\n# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation\n# Copy the \"profile ID\"\n# Open Bisq 1 and go to \"DAO/PROOF OF BURN\" and paste the copied value into the \"pre-image\" field\n# Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn\n# Publish the Burn BSQ transaction\n# After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile\n\nOn the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under 'User Options' > 'Reputation'\n\nframe|left\n\n```\nBurning BSQ has the highest impact on the reputation score.\n\nFor every BSQ burnt the user receives a reputation score of 100. For example if a user burns 100 BSQ their reputation score will be increased by 10,000. Reputation obtained by burning will persist with that users profile.\n\nTo increase their reputation further a user can burn multiple times. The scores received are cumulative.\n```\n\n## = Setting up a BSQ bond\n=\n\nSimilar to Burn BSQ but using refundable BSQ bonds.\n\nBSQ needs to be bonded for a minimum of 50,000 blocks (about 1 year). During this time the BSQ is unavailable to the user. After 50,000 blocks the bond can be unlocked and the BSQ is available again to the user.\n\nThe value gained by bonding BSQ persists until the time the bond is unlocked. Reputation scores achieved from bonding BSQ is cumulative. It can be assumed that regular bonding (e.g. each week or month) is a form of work and represents activity by the user resulting in a higher reputation score.\n\nA bond can be confiscated (destroyed by a Bisq DAO vote). This would only be done if a bond holder was scamming users. To confiscate a scammers bond requires high quorum at DAO voting, thus its more risky that the confiscation might fail.\n\nData about bonded BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node.\n\n**Follow these steps to bond BSQ for reputation:**\n\n# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation\n# Copy the \"profile ID\"\n# Open Bisq 1 and go to \"DAO/BONDING/BONDED REPUTATION\" and paste the copied value into the \"salt\" field\n# Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lockup and the lock time (50000 blocks)\n# Publish the lockup transaction\n# After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile\n\nOn the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under 'User Options' > 'Reputation'\n\nframe|left\n\n```\nBonding BSQ has a high impact on the reputation score.\n\nFor every BSQ bonded the user receives a reputation score of 10. For example if a user bonds 1,000 BSQ their reputation score will be increased by 10,000. Reputation obtained by burning will persist with that users profile.\n\nTo increase their reputation further a user can bond multiple times. The scores received are cumulative.\n\nOnce the bond is unlocked the reputation score attributed to that bond is lost.\n```\n\n## = Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1\n=\n\nUsers of Bisq 1 can gain reputation by importing their account age from Bisq 1 into Bisq 2.\n\nAccounts ages from Bisq 1 could include any of the following account types:\n\nAny Fiat account can be used.\n\nThe older the user's account age the more trustworthy the user will be assumed to be.\n\nIn case of repeated registrations the oldest account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated.\n\n**Follow these steps to import your account age from Bisq 1 for reputation:**\n\n# Open the account age reputation section on Bisq 2\n# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation\n# Copy the \"profile ID\" to paste on Bisq 1\n# Open Bisq 1 and go to \"ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS\"\n# Select the oldest account and click 'Export Account'\n# This will add a signed message with the Bisq 2 profile ID\n# Paste the signature from Bisq 1 in the account age reputation section on Bisq 2\n# Press 'Request authorization' button\n\nOn the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under 'User Options' > 'Reputation'\n\nframe|left\n\n```\nImporting an account age from Bisq 1 the lowest impact on the reputation score.\n\nFor every day old the user's account is they will receive a reputation score of 2.5. For example if a user imports a 300 day old account from Bisq 1 their reputation score will be increased by 750. Reputation obtained from importing their account age will be cumulative with all other reputation scores the user obtains.\n\nA user cannot obtain the minimum reputation score required from importing their account age alone, they would need to burn or bond BSQ to achieve this.\n\nThe maximum reputation score a user can achieve from importing an account age is 5,000. This can be achieved when importing accounts of 2,000 days old, or older.\n```\n\n## = Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1\n=\n\nUsers of Bisq 1 can gain reputation by importing their signed account age from Bisq 1 into Bisq 2.\n\nAny signed account from Bisq 1 can be used.\n\nThe older the user's signed account age the more trustworthy the user will be assumed to be.\n\nIn case of repeated registrations the oldest signed account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated. account will be used (as it has the highest value). Multiple accounts do not get accumulated.\n\n**Follow these steps to import your signed account age from Bisq 1 for reputation:**\n\n# Open the account signed account age witness reputation section on Bisq 2\n# Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation\n# Copy the \"profile ID\" to paste on Bisq 1\n# Open Bisq 1 and go to \"ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS\"\n# Select the oldest signed account and click 'Export Account'\n# This will add a signed message with the Bisq 2 profile ID\n# Paste the signature from Bisq 1 in the signed account age witness reputation section on Bisq 2\n# Press 'Request authorization' button\n\nOn the bisq 2 app you will find this same information under 'User Options' > 'Reputation'\n\nframe|left\n\n```\nImporting a signed account age from Bisq 1 has a low impact on the reputation score.\n\nFor every day old the user's singed account is they will receive a reputation score of 5. For example if a user imports a 300 day old account from Bisq 1 their reputation score will be increased by 1500. Reputation obtained from importing their signed account age will be cumulative with all other reputation scores the user obtains.\n\nA user cannot obtain the minimum reputation score required from importing their signed account age alone, they would need to burn or bond BSQ to achieve this.\n\nThe maximum reputation score a user can achieve from importing a signed account is 10,000. This can be achieved when importing accounts of 2,000 days old, or older.\n```\n\n## Reputation Simulation Tool\n\nFor bitcoin sellers it can get a little complicated to work out what the best way is to increase their reputation. To help make the decision process easier Bisq 2 provides a simulation tool for sellers to see what different actions they can take to increase their reputation.\n\nThe simulation tool can be access from the reputation system. It can be used for both burning and bonding BSQ. Here is an screenshot showing it in use for burning BSQ.\n\nframe|left\n\n## What happens when a user profile ID is banned?\n\nWhen a user profile ID is banned they lose all reputation associated with that profile ID.\n\nThe profile ID contains a pub key hash that is tied to a corresponding reputation score.\n\nOnce a user profile ID is banned their corresponding reputation score will no longer be visible.\n\nModerators will ensure that they only ban profile IDs that have severely, or repeatedly, violated Bisq trade protocols. Banned users might be impacted in Bisq 1 as well (e.g. their onion address will be banned, or a BSQ bond confiscation proposal is made, if applicable).", "category": "bisq2"}

{"title": "Teams", "content": "thumb\n\nBisq is a FOSS project. Governance is decentralised through the DAO. Work is coordinated through a number of teams with some core members and other external contributors working with a particular team on a project basis. There is no CEO. True Names are not required. Anonymous and pseudonymous contributors are welcome.\n\n## List of Teams\n\n* 1. Ops Team is responsible for operating Bisq infrastructure nodes and other services with high availability, decentralized and censorship-resistant.\n* 2. Dev Team focused on developing and launching new Bisq releases.\n* 3. Support Team is responsible for providing support for Bisq users.\n* 4.

This can be done on a per-project basis for some types of work, through bounties for one-off tasks or by opening it up to the market in an automatic way following the model of Bitcoin miners. Ideally 90% of work will require only in-team coordination. In theory each team could behave as an external contractor, being assigned work by the DAO and then presenting a compensation request when the work is completed, just as an external contractor would present the bill for services rendered.\n\n## Privacy and security\n\nAnonymity and pseudonymity are welcome at Bisq. Bisq is global and many countries have unfriendly regulations for Bitcoin, exchanges, DEX, FOSS, etc. Many countries do not respect Free Speech or Private Property. Contributors should be able to work for the Bisq DAO without requiring to endanger their privacy. This is another important reason to decentralise work and rely on external contributors that can complete a project, get paid and leave. Proof of work should be the standard for compensation and merit.\n\n## Control\n\nExperienced team members should take responsibility for control of new team members, external contributors and outsourced workers. They can exercise this control by commenting on and approving (or not) their compensation requests every cycle.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nThere are no recruiters for Bisq.

Users will be able to switch between trade protocols for different trades should they wish.\n\nAs of now, Bisq Easy stands as the sole implemented protocol, tailored for novice Bitcoin users and suitable for smaller trade amounts.\n\n## Bisq Easy\n\nBisq Easy will be the first trade protocol for Bisq 2. It will be accessible on the launch of Bisq 2. It is an easy to use chat based trade protocol for buying and selling bitcoin for fiat. The security is based on reputation of the sellers.\n\nSee here for more information about Bisq Easy.\n\n## Future Trade Protocols\n\nBisq is planning on adding more trade protocols available on Bisq 2.

Keep an eye out for updates if any of the upcoming protocols catch your interest.\n\n## = Bisq Lightning\n=\n\nEscrow based trade protocol on the Lightning network using multi-party computation cryptography.\n\n## = Bisq MuSig\n=\n\nBisq 1 currently uses a 2-of-2 multisig as its main trade protocol. This involves the buyer and seller putting down a security deposit that is locked in a multisig until the trade completes. At some point this protocol will be moved over to Bisq 2.\n\n## = BSQ swaps\n=\n\nThis allows users to swap from BSQ to BTC and vice versa via atomic swaps, instantaneously and secure.\n\n## = Liquid Swaps\n=\n\nTrade any Liquid based assets like USDT and BTC-L with an atomic swap on the Liquid network.\n\n## = Monero Swaps\n=\n\nTrade Bitcoin and Monero using an atomic cross chain swap.\n\n## = Liquid MuSig\n=\n\nThis trade protocol will use the same trade protocol as the 2-of-2 multisig but it will replace Bitcoin (BTC) with Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC). The advantage to this is fees will be lower, and users will get more privacy with their trades. The disadvantage is that users will not be trading native bitcoin so will have to be comfortable holding LBTC and consider the costs of converting BTC to LBTC and back again.\n\n## = Submarine Swaps\n=\n\nThis trade protocol allows users to swap between Bitcoin on Lightning network to on-chain Bitcoin.\n\n## = Stablecoin Swaps\n=\n\nAtomic swaps between Bitcoin and USD stablecoin. Just the same as BSQ swaps, but with a Bitcoin coloured coin built on the same tech.\n\n## = Multisig Options\n=\n\nThis trade protocol would allow the creation of P2P put and call options with the buyer and seller blocking BTC in a multisig on-chain transaction. 2 PSBT would be created sending the BTC to the buyer or seller depending on the result of a binary event. On expiry a blind oracle would trigger the correct transaction to be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.\n\n## = Multisig open contracts\n=\n\nThis trade protocol will allow user defined conditional payments. Any simple contract can be created by locking funds in a multisig 2-of-3 transaction with an arbitrator holding the third key and deciding if the condition was met in case of dispute. This is similar to the old Bisq 1 2-of-3 multisig model, but open to any type of contract than can be easily verified.\n\n## Adding Trade Protocols to Bisq 2\n\nTrade protocols are designed to be modular so more trade protocols can be added in the future.

Wise to Wise payments allow users to send payment from any supported currency to any other supported currency. Payments utilize the Wise multi-currency account. This is available for users in most countries.\n\n## Setting up a Wise Account\n\nSet up an account. Go to [https://wise.com/ Wise] and register for an account. KYC will be required.\n\n## Setting up a Wise Account in Bisq\n\nGo to Account > National Currency Accounts in Bisq and select Add New Account.\n\nEnter the email address you have registered with TransferWise and the currencies you would like to make and take offers with.\n\n## Getting your Wise account ready for trading\n\n''This section is primarily for **BTC sellers** using Wise.''\n\nYou can set up your account on the mobile app or on the web site. Screenshots are from the website.\n\nOn the left click 'open a balance'. Choose the currency you would like to trade in and select Confirm. You can add as many currencies as you wish.\n\nThe following currencies all come with local bank details as part of your Wise account (may differ depending on locations):\n\n* AUD\n* EUR\n* GBP\n* NZD\n* RON\n* SGD\n* USD\n\nIf you are selling Bitcoin on Bisq these accounts are useful as they allow you to trade with those currencies as they give you a recipient bank account that can be used to receive funds from the Buyer of Bitcoin\n\nClick on recipients. This is where you set up where you want the money paid to.\n\nClick 'Add your bank account' and enter your bank account details (these can be your own bank details, or they can be the Wise local bank account details you have created).\n\nOnce added click the down arrow next to the account and select '[https://wise.com/help/articles/2932129/nominating-a-primary-account make primary]'. This means when someone pays you via Wise to Wise it will go into your primary bank account.\n\nNB: You need to have a primary bank account set up for each currency you wish to receive funds to on Wise. If you do not have a payment account set up the trader might not be able to send payment to you. If they are able payment will appear in your Wise balance for this currency.\n\n## Making payments with Wise\n\n''This section is primarily for **BTC buyers** using Wise.''\n\nBecause of the way Wise payments are implemented in the Bisq trade protocol, the only information sellers have about buyers is their email address.\n\nWise has a useful guide about this [https://wise.com/help/articles/2932105/can-i-send-money-to-someone-with-only-their-email-address in their help section].\n\nTo set up a transfer to an email address, follow these steps:\n\n# Start a transfer by clicking the Send money button\n# At the recipient step, choose Someone else or Business or charity\n# Untick the box next to I know their bank details\n# Enter your recipient’s email and full name\n# Pay for the transfer as usual\n\nYou can then choose how you would like to pay. You can even pay by credit or debit card!\n\nOn the case that the payment was made with a name different from the email address (which is allowed) and could create some confusion, the receiver could verify that the name of the btc buyer is correct by writing his email on a new payment and see if the name matches the one he received it from. *Of course do not go through resending them any funds, there is no need in order to verify the name.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "ACH Transfer", "content": "**ACH Transfer**, or Automated Clearing House Trasnfer, is a payment method introduced in Bisq v1.8.0. It is primarily used for domestic, low-value payments between participating financial institutions. ACH transfers are one of the two main bank transfer payment methods in the United States, the other being domestic Wire transfers.\n\n## What countries offer ACH Transfer?\n\nACH is only available in the United States.\n\n## What currencies are available for ACH Transfer?\n\nACH only supports transfers of USD.\n\n## What is the maximum trading duration for ACH Transfer?\n\nThe maximum trade time is 5 days, but most are completed within 2 business days. Financial institutions send ACH transfers in batches. Depending on when the transfer is initiated, it will be received the next business day, by the end of the current day, or in real time.\n\n## What is the maximum BTC limit for ACH Transfer?\n\n.\n\n## Is ACH Transfer a payment method that can be signed?\n\nNo, ACH accounts do not require signing.\n\n## How do I set up a ACH Transfer account?\n\nPlease note that not all banks offer ACH transfers to third parties. It's crucial to verify if your bank supports this service. Most banks allow ACH transfers to accounts you own at other institutions. However, they may ask you to confirm two micro-deposits they initiate. This process is not the same as a third-party transfer and Bisq sellers usually won't confirm these micro-deposits. Confirming micro-deposits enables your bank to send and receive money from that account, but this isn't a third-party transfer. If your bank fully supports third-party ACH transfers, they won't ask for micro-deposit verification. ACH transfers are typically provided at a low cost, so be sure to check with your bank about any fees.\n\n## How do I add ACH Transfer as a payment method in Bisq?\n\nTo add your ACH account to Bisq:\n\n# Head to the top menu and select ''Account''.\n# Then, choose ''National Currency Accounts''.\n# Click on ''Add new account''.\n# Select ''ACH''.\n# Fill in the necessary details.\n# If you'd like, choose to use a custom account name. This can help you manage multiple payment methods in Bisq. It will be visible only to you, like \"ACH - Chase Bank - USD - Jane Doe\".\n# Once done, click save new account.\n# If you have more than one ACH account you wish to add to Bisq you can create different accounts for each.\n\nEnsure all the details are accurate when you add them. Sellers can only confirm payment if the name associated with the incoming ACH transfer matches the account name listed in Bisq.\n\n## How do I buy BTC with my ACH Transfer account?\n\nYou can buy BTC with ACH on Bisq in 2 ways:\n\n# Make an offer to buy BTC on the USD market.\n# Take an offer to buy BTC on the USD market.\n\nWhen the offer is confirmed, Bisq will provide you with the BTC seller's ACH details for you to complete the payment. You should send the payment immediately and confirm you have done so in Bisq by clicking 'payment started'.\n\nIf you have the option to include a payment reference, please leave it blank. If your bank requires one, please just use your name that matches your bank account.\n\nOnce the BTC seller receives your payment, they will confirm in Bisq, and your security deposit and your purchased trade amount will be available in your wallet.\n\n## How do I sell BTC with my ACH Transfer account?\n\nYou can sell BTC with ACH on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer on the USD market to sell your BTC.\n# Take an existing offer on the USD market to sell your BTC.\n\nAfter the offer is confirmed, Bisq will provide the BTC Buyer with your ACH details. The Buyer should send the payment at their earliest convenience and confirm it in Bisq by clicking 'Payment Started'.\n\n## Are there any limits for me to be aware of when sending an ACH transfer\n\nYour bank may impose limits on the amounts you can send or receive. You should check if your bank has any such limits.\n\n## Are there any fees for me to be aware of when sending an ACH transfer?\n\n\nFees charged by your bank for sending an ACH transfer can vary and it's best to check with them. Fees can also be different depending on the speed of the transfer as some banks offer expedited processing.\n\nGenerally, banks will not charge for receiving ACH transfers, but again, it's best to check with your bank since some do charge.\n\n## How does dispute resolution work with ACH transfers?\n\nIf a dispute occurs, the mediator may ask the buyer to send them information showing that they made the payment of the correct amount to the BTC Seller within the correct time frame. The mediator may also ask the seller to send them information to prove their account details are correct, or in the case of the BTC Buyer making a payment late, or of the wrong amount.\n\nFor more information see dispute resolution.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Account limits", "content": "Elevated **account limits** apply to fiat payment accounts in order to limit damage a malicious user can do while allowing honest users to start trading immediately with no KYC and utmost privacy.\n\nAltcoin accounts can trade 0.5 BTC right away, but all fiat payment account types have limits lower than 0.5 BTC to match their particular risk profiles (see this table for details). Some payment methods with chargeback risk implement a mechanism called ''account signing'' that restricts trading activity until a trader proves their integrity to further secure against foul play.\n\nTo reduce the size of trades entering arbitration Bisq also sets new users trade limits to be 0.1 BTC. This is an additional limit to account limits but users can opt out of this limit at any time.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Which payment accounts are affected\n\nOnly fiat payment methods are affected by elevated account limits. Altcoin accounts are only affected by the new user limits which can be opted out if necessary for allow every altcoin account to trade up to 0.5 BTC right away upon creating a payment account in Bisq.\n\nAll fiat payment methods in all markets limit total trade size depending on the payment method's risk profile (see this table for details).\n\nDespite these limitations, chargebacks can still be possible for certain payment methods. Bisq reduces this risk with a mechanism called **account signing**.\n\nAccount signing only applies to payment accounts that meet ''both'' of the following conditions:\n* used in the following markets: USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, or BRL\n* is subject to chargeback risk: SEPA, SEPA Instant, Interac e-Transfer, Zelle, Revolut, Chase QuickPay, Popmoney, MoneyBeam, Uphold, and any kind of bank transfer\n\nThis means that all payment accounts that deal in currencies not listed above do ''not'' require account signing, even if they are subject to chargeback risk.\n\n## Account aging\n\n400px|thumb|See account age in the offer book.\n\nAccount age is no longer used to determine trade size limits for most payment methods. It is still measured, however, and you can see a payment account's age in the offer book before taking an offer, but we caution against using it as a measure of integrity. Older accounts are not ''necessarily'' safer.\n\n**Practically, this means that all payment methods on Bisq have full selling capability from the moment they are created.** Selling limits no longer phase in over time.\n\nSome payment methods implement a variation of account aging called account signing whereby limits are increased in stages over a period of 60 days after signing. More about this below.\n\nIf you're interested, details on the AccountAgeWitness object that enables this aging mechanism are [https://docs.bisq.network/payment-account-age-witness.html here].\n\n## Account signing\n\nthumb|right|A graphical overview of account signing.\n\nAccount signing limits ''buying'' limits of risky fiat payment methods to until the trader has bought bitcoin from a seller with a signed payment account, and then gradually phases in full buying limits. Selling limits are unaffected.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is how it works:\n* Payment account is created in Bisq for risky payment method\n** Buying is limited to BTC per trade until account is signed (see how below)\n* 30 days after signing, buying limits are increased to 50% of maximum\n* 60 days after signing, maximum trade size is allowed\n\nLet's see how this works in practice by looking at an example. SEPA has a maximum trade size of 0.0624 BTC, and it requires account signing in order for to enable full trade limits.\n\nFirst let's observe what happens if a new SEPA account is never signed. Notice how buying limits never increase beyond , but selling 0.0624 BTC is allowed from day 0.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Time Since Creating SEPA Payment Account (Never Signed)\n!

Maximum Trade Size (Sell)\n|-\n| Day 0\n|\n| 0.0624 BTC\n|-\n| Day 30\n|\n| 0.0624 BTC\n|-\n| Day 60\n|\n| 0.0624 BTC\n|-\n| Day 90\n|\n| 0.0624 BTC\n|}\n\nIf that SEPA account manages to get signed on the same day it's created, it will see its limit increased on Day 30. Selling limits are unaffected.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Time Since Creating SEPA Payment Account\n! Maximum Trade Size (Buy)\n!

There's two ways to get your account signed.\n\n##\nBuying BTC\n##\n\nTo sign your account you have to buy BTC following these requirements:\n* trade amount is greater than or equal to BTC and lesser than or equal to\n* offer must be in a market that requires signing (USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, BRL)\n* seller's account must have been signed for over 30 days at the time of the signing trade\n\nThrough taking an offer you can make sure that the offer fulfills the requirements to sign your account. Making an offer could not sign your account, because taker could be unable to sign your account (signed since less than 30 days, or unsigned).\n\nThe Bisq interface makes it easy to determine if an offer can help you get signed: simply **look for buy offers with a check mark badge**:\n\n600px|thumb|left|Top offer won't get you signed. Bottom offer will get you signed.\n\nIn the image above, the offer on top does not have a check mark, but the offer on the bottom does. And it's a valid size (i.e., between BTC and ), so taking that offer and successfully completing the trade will result in a signed account.\n\nYou can see your payment account's limits and signing status at Accounts > National Currency Accounts. Pick an account and look toward the bottom:\n\n600px|thumb|left|Where to see your payment account's limits and signing status.\n\n##\nWith your own signed account\n##\n\nOnce you have 1 signed payment account, any new payment account you create that requires signing will be self-signed as long as it uses the **exact same name** as your previously signed account. The payment account can be of a different type (e.g. a signed SEPA account can self-sign a SEPA Instant account), but a payment account created with a name that is even slightly different will not be self-signed.\n\nPayment account types that don't require your full name cannot be self-signed (e.g. Revolut, which only requires an email address) and they cannot self-sign other payment accounts.\n\nSelf-signed accounts are immediately signed, but limits are not immediately lifted. This is because they have an age of 0 days, so 30 days must pass for the limit to be lifted, and another 30 days must pass for full trading ability to take effect (see tables above).\n\n## Backing up and restoring payment accounts\n\nOnce your payment accounts have accrued age and been signed, you won't want to give them up. With proper backups, you won't have to—payment accounts can be restored if you ever have to remove/reinstall Bisq, move to another machine, etc.\n\n## User opt-out limits\n\nTo reduce trades into arbitration for new users unfamiliar with Bisq, new users have a 0.1 BTC limit by default that can be opt-out of at any time.\n\nTo access this limit go to Settings > Preferences\n\nframeless|left|Trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or changed at any time\n\nShown above is the trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or edited higher or lower at any time.\n\nIf you opt of of this limit you will be given a pop up message informing you...\n\nAccount signing limits are still applied to buy BTC with most National Account payment methods to reduce chargeback risk.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Arbitration", "content": "**Arbitration** refers to the last stage of the dispute resolution process—it's what takes place in case trader chat and mediation fail to resolve a dispute.\n\nThis page first covers the arbitration process itself, in a practical sense, so that users can be made aware of what to expect when trading. Then it covers the process in more detail, including its motivations, how all the components work together, and how the process is expected to develop in the future.\n\n## Process\n\nBisq's arbitration process is a thoroughly decentralized approach to handling disputes between 2 strangers on the internet: one in which no user needs to trust a third party with authority over their funds, but one in which a user can still expect a satisfactory outcome if they have followed the Bisq trading rules.\n\nArbitration is only available when:\n\n* one or both traders reject a mediator’s suggested payout\n* the time-locked delayed payout transaction is published\n\nA ''time-locked delayed payout transaction'' is signed (but not published) at the beginning of the trade process. Its purpose is to allow time for traders and mediators to work out a payout using the funds in the 2-of-2 multisig escrow, and to eliminate the possibility of fraud in case they can't.\n\nRequesting arbitration publishes this time-locked transaction, sending all funds in the multisig escrow (i.e., those of both trading peers) to the Bisq \"donation addresses\" (which are owned by the Burning Men, Bisq contributors who burn BSQ in advance). This transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for altcoin trades) and 20 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for fiat trades), which means arbitration is only available after this time has passed.\n\nBurning Men burn BSQ after estimating how many BTC from trading fees and delayed payouts will be during a cycle, and a filter controlled by the DAO distributes the BTC in proportion to how many BSQ have been burned. This keeps BSQ supply balanced, allowing for a corresponding amount of new BSQ to be issued to account for the BTC payouts made to traders as part of arbitration. As a result, BSQ supply is largely unaffected.\n\nThis dynamic essentially enables a sort of mutually assured destruction to drive dispute resolution on Bisq without trusted third parties.\n\n**In plain language, here's how the process works for traders:**\n\n# If you’re dissatisfied with the mediator’s suggestion and think you are entitled to a better outcome, request arbitration when it's available (doing so publishes the time-locked transaction and sends funds to the donation addresses owned by the Burning Men).\n# Collaborate with an arbitrator to clarify the details of your case.\n# If the arbitrator agrees you are owed BTC, they will pay it to you.\n# The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO so they are not out of pocket.\n\nTakeaway: if you are owed BTC after a dispute, you'll get it from an arbitrator who will refund you with their own funds. The arbitrator then requests reimbursement from the Bisq DAO usually once per DAO cycle and asks for the BSQ amount as a reimbursement for the BTC they have refunded Bisq traders. .\n\n## Process, In Detail\n\nTo better understand arbitration, we need to first understand the new trade protocol, and how it improves upon the old trade protocol.\n\n## = Pre v1.2 Trade Protocol\n=\n\nThe previous model with 2-of-3 multisig deposit transactions (where an arbitrator was the 3rd key holder, and makes the payout to one of the traders in dispute cases) carried a significant risk: if the arbitrator was malicious (or was hacked), he could have taken all offers with a sockpuppet trader and made the payouts right back to his own sockpuppet.\n\nThis risk made it impossible to scale dispute resolution and find more arbitrators—we were limited to filling the role with a tiny number of Bisq contributors who could be 100% trusted to not be malicious and who had a good enough background in computer security to make getting hacked highly unlikely.\n\nThis element was the single most problematic element in Bisq’s old trade protocol, but since there weren’t any better solutions, we used it for as long as we had to.\n\n## = Post 1.2 Trade Protocol\n=\n\nThe new trade protocol, launched in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.0 Bisq v1.2], eliminates the risks described above to a large extent by separating functions and involving the DAO. It significantly improves censorship-resistance, security, and scalability of dispute resolution on Bisq.\n\nthumb|right|Dispute resolution for trade protocol (v1.2+).\n\nThe basic change is that it uses a 2-of-2 multisig in the deposit transaction with only the traders’ keys.\n\nOn the happy path, the traders each sign the payout tx once the fiat or altcoin is transferred.\n\nIf anything goes wrong, there are 3 stages to resolve the issue:\n\n# The traders can have a direct chat where they can try to find a solution to their problem.\n# If that does not succeed either trader can open a mediation ticket and request help from a mediator. Mediators play a role similar to that of arbitrators in the old model, except they don’t have a 3rd key. They only can make a ''suggestion'' for the payout distribution, which either trader is free to accept or reject. If both traders accept, they create and sign the payout tx and the trade is completed. If either trader rejects, the dispute goes to stage 3. This escalation can only take place after a certain time period has passed. For altcoins, this period is 10 days, and for fiat it’s 20 days.\n# An arbitrator will investigate the case, just like a mediator would, and decide how a payout should be distributed. The arbitrator role currently has 2 parts: supreme mediator and refund agent (this is where the term ''refund agent'' comes from, but ''arbitrator'' is a better term for the role, as we will soon see). The supreme mediator part of the role is similar in function to that of a regular mediator (i.e., investigate a dispute). The refund agent reimburses traders BTC for disputed trades without requiring them to undergo the complex and time-consuming process of making a reimbursement request in the DAO. The ultimate goal, however, is to make such extreme dispute cases so ''rare'' that requiring users to request reimbursement from the DAO on their own becomes feasible (e.g., by reducing bugs, UX improvements, increasing security deposits, etc). But we’re not there yet, so for now, an arbitrator simply decides on a payout ''and'' funds this payout from their own pocket, and later makes a reimbursement request to the DAO to be reimbursed for their reimbursement to the user. To avoid potential fraud, and to keep the DAO from losing money in each arbitration case, we use the donation address to receive the funds from the trade via the time-locked delayed payout payout tx.\n\n## = Time-Locked Delayed Payout Payout Transaction\n=\nSince [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.8 v1.9.8], traders create a time-locked delayed payout payout tx where all the locked up funds (trade amount + both security deposits) are sent to Bisq donation address owners, also known as burningmen. These addresses are defined in the DAO. The burningmen are Bisq contributors who burn their BSQ in order to get a portion of time-locked delayed payouts and trading fees paid in BTC.\nFrom v1.2 to v1.9.8, this address was controlled by a single burning man who exchanged BTC for BSQ to burn them afterwards. That supposed a risk for the DAO as, although the burningman had to place a BSQ bond, the amount of the bond was lower than the amount of expected BTC to collect. Distributing the role into multiple burningman and requiring them to burn BSQ in advance, this risk has significantly decreased.\n\nIf a trade is not completed in 10 days (for altcoins) or 20 days (for fiat), either of the 2 traders have a chance (after mediation) to publish the time-locked payout tx where all deposit funds are sent to the donation address, requiring the aggrieved trader to request arbitration so they can receive a payout. With the preliminary solution we use now, the trader gets a payout from an arbitrator directly, **but the eventual goal is that the arbitrator makes a suggestion which the DAO uses as a basis for voting on the reimbursement request made by the trader(s)**.\n\n## = Avoiding Fraud\n=\n\nThe time-locked delayed payout payout tx is essential to avoid fraud. A trader could make a self-trade and then claim that his “peer” has not paid. Without the time-locked payout tx, he could go through the dispute process, make a reimbursement request, and receive BSQ for the equivalent “lost” funds in BTC. After that he could make the payout to himself from the trade, since he controls both “traders”—thereby scamming the DAO with the trade amount.\n\nTo avoid this fraud, we require that locked up funds in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx are spent before opening an arbitration ticket. Thus it is not possible for a trader to defraud the DAO in the way described above.\n\n## = Donation Address Owners (burningmen)\n=\n\nBurningmen are current and past contributors who earned BSQ by contributing to Bisq who opt to to burn their BSQ to get BTC from time-locked delayed payout transactions and trading fees paid in BTC. A DAO filter distributes the BTC in proportion to their relative amount of BSQ burned. The amount of BSQ to be burned is limited for each contributor, to prevent that a single burningman could create self trades and take advantage from being refunded at arbitration and receiving BTC from the DAO filter as well. In order to keep this system safe, it is required that refund agent does not reimburse a security deposit from deposit transaction.\nThe amount of BSQ to be burned (burn target) is estimated from accumulated reimbursement requests, trade fees paid in BTC and burned BSQ from burningmen in the last 12 months.\nThe BSQ burned and BTC sent to burningmen should balance over time. Each one of the burningmen, according to their prefferences, could try to \"charge\" a discount rate for the risk assumed advancing their BSQ to the DAO by burning less than the burning target, or they could try to \"pay\" to avoid selling big volumes of BSQ to a low liquid market by overburning (up to 100.000 BSQ over the burning target). They could also under or overestimate the amount of BTC to be received over the next year, which is the period that burned amounts decay linearly: the burn target is an estimation with data from the past.\nDAO contributors have another way to turn BSQ into BTC while contributing to remove the legacy burningman, which was a central point of failure for the Bisq DAO and created distorsion as a big BSQ buyer. Some burningmen will require to buy BSQ to be burned eventually. The impact for the market will be reduced as there will be multiple interested parties.\n\nLet’s make a simple example to clarify:\n\n* Two traders are engaged in a 1 BTC trade, with 0.15 BTC each locked in a security deposit\n* 1.3 BTC is locked in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx (ignoring miner fees)\n* Assume BSQ/BTC is trading at 0.0001 (for easy calculations)\n\nAfter the required time passes, and the mediation process is closed, one of the traders opens an arbitration case. By doing so, the 1.3 BTC is sent to donation addresses (controlled by the burning men). This transaction was signed by both traders at the time the offer was taken, but was time-locked so it was invalid until the required time had passed. The arbitrator investigates the case and makes a 1.15 BTC payout to the winning trader. He pays this sum from his personal wallet (pre-financing).\n\nWe assume that burningmen know there will be only one delayed payout during a cycle: burningmen burned 12,000 BSQ and received the 1.3 BTC into different addresses (which generates a 0.1 BTC profit), each one receiving a % based on the amount they've burned.\nThe arbitrator then makes a reimbursement request of 11,500 BSQ to settle his pre-financing. When approved, the DAO issues 11,500 BSQ to the arbitrator. The 0.1 BTC profit for burningmen was subsidized with the 0.15 BTC from the unpaid security deposit. The DAO keeps the other 0.5 BTC in form of reduction in BSQ supply of 0.05 BTC.\nArbitrator will have to burn or sell the BSQ the reimbursed BSQ to get BTC for new payments and reduce volatility risk, which is taking a high risk as they pre-finance the reimbursement. Bisq tries to make arbitration rare as reimbursing traders has a big cost.\n\n## = Why We Cannot Merge the Arbitrator and Burning Man Roles\n=\n\nThe separation of these roles is essential to keep the system flexible, censorship-resistant, and scalable.\n\n**Keep in mind that the current dual role of arbitrators (i.e., supreme mediator and refund agent) is not the ultimate goal**. The refund agent part of the role should be delegated to traders once the trade process is improved to a level where such cases rarely happen. How to keep the burden for traders low, and how to compensate them for this extra work—these items are still up for discussion (e.g. the trader could get a slight bonus if he does the reimbursement himself). A preferred option is to keep trader-submitted reimbursement requests optional and still offer arbitrator-funded reimbursements for a fee. The role could even be split, such that a market of refund agents develops where each agent offers their pre-financing services at different prices. But before getting into any of these discussions, we need to reduce bugs and improve UX.\n\nThe role of the burning man has been distributed between different contributors and a part of their earnings come directly as BTC, but it could also disappear when we have very few dispute cases, and once trade fees in BTC do not add up to a large amount. We could use the donation address to support critical infrastructure we use like Tor. Or we could use it to fund Bisq projects like the mobile wallet. There are many possibilities for how we could use these funds—but if we merged the burning man role with the arbitrator role, we would lose this flexibility.\n\nThe risks of the 2 roles are very different. An arbitrator does not present any severe risk to the DAO, actually, he ''takes on'' a lot of risk. A single burning man, on the other hand, is a trusted role and there is an open problem that a malicious burning man could make many trades, go to the arbitrator, get payouts, and then run away with the funds he received from the donation address. The high bond is a partial protection, but ultimately, this is a trusted role and only highly trusted Bisq contributors can take it on. This problem has been mitigated by distributing the role between different contributors with a cap on how much BTC they can get. So scalability is a small issue with the distributed burningmen, but we cannot say the same about the arbitrator. With more traders, there will be more cases, and we might need more arbitrators. Furthermore, with more regional expansion, we will need arbitrators with particular language skills. When arbitrators and burningmen are not combined into one role, we can add arbitrators to support this growth without posing high risk to the Bisq network. If we merged both roles, we would not be able to do this. There is a risk arbitrators expose to the DAO: they could fake their reporting, but this is likely solvable (traders can provide evidence).\n\nAnother important aspect is that arbitrator reimbursement is not automated. DAO stakeholders have ultimate power. Sure, they would probably lose an arbitrator if they don’t reimburse him fairly, and it might be hard to find new arbitrators after unfair behaviour from DAO stakeholders. But it is highly important that stakeholders be able to exercise absolute power.\n\nAnother consideration: if the process to reimburse arbitrators were automated, the result would probably involve legal risks that we want to avoid. The role would then adopt elements of a custodial function, and that would likely trigger regulatory issues.\n\n## = FAQ\n=\n\n**What are the conditions that lead to a payout, for example, a dispute between Bob and Alice that is not resolved by normal mediation and gets escalated to arbitration?**\n\nAfter the time-lock period (10 days for altcoins and 20 days for fiat), and after mediation is completed, either trader can open an arbitration ticket. Doing so publishes the time-locked delayed payout transaction.\n\n**How are Bob and Alice's BTC funds paid out to the Bisq donation addresses?**\n\nThe time-locked payout transaction is created and signed in the take-offer process and stored by both traders. The trade protocol requires this transaction to be in place before a trade is started.\n\n**How is the arbitrator responsible for deciding what the payout distribution should be? Are facts and circumstances of the case taken into account? And how is this similar to legacy arbitration?**\n\nIn terms of determining what a payout should be, an arbitrator's role is the same as that of a mediator. They'll ask you for any additional information they need to determine the facts and circumstances of the case. The only practical difference between arbitration and legacy arbitration is that arbitrators use their own funds to pay trader(s) instead of funds from the trading escrow.\n\n**How, upon deciding a payout, does an arbitrator pay the BTC to Bob and Alice?**\n\nArbitrators need to have enough BTC to cover potential payouts (up to 0.5 BTC per trade) — it's a requirement for anyone seeking to hold the role. An arbitration case can only be closed once an arbitrator makes a payout. Then, at the end of the DAO cycle, they'll get reimbursed with BSQ (which they can then sell for BTC).\n\n**Are there any trades the arbitrator will not pay out? **\n\nArbitrators will only reimburse trades in which the multisig deposit has been sent to the Bisq donation addresses. For trades requiring large reimbursements (above 0.5 BTC) they should be aware the arbitrators will only [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/296 partially reimburse traders up to 0.5 BTC]. Should a trader require a reimbursement over 0.5 BTC they can make a reimbursement request directly to the DAO on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support support repository].\n\n**How does the arbitrator issue a reimbursement request for an amount of BSQ equivalent to the amount of BTC paid out-of-pocket to settle disputes?**\n\nThis process is a work in progress. Currently we try to reduce volatility and exposure risk by converting pre-financed BTC to BSQ as fast as possible. Once it is BSQ there is no longer any volatility risk, and the arbitrator simply sums up all pre-financed BSQ and requests reimbursement. The public result of an arbitrator's work is a reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO.\n\n**How does the DAO issue this BSQ to reimburse arbitrators?**\n\nA reimbursement request is technically the same as a compensation request. DAO stakeholders vote on an arbitrator's request. The arbitrator needs to provide solid reporting to make their request transparent to the DAO. Currently there is some trust involved, since it cannot be proven that the arbitrator is not adding fake cases. This may be solvable by collecting data from traders, but this requires more thought.\n\n**Doesn't this dispute resolution mechanism incentivize Bisq to have more trades go to arbitration, since disputed BTC funds are sent to the burningmen, and thereby benefit BSQ holders and themselves?**\n\nIt's the traders who open arbitration, the DAO can't start arbitration, although it could generate bugs and be unresponsive at mediation. In this case, traders will be fully reimbursed (which will generate a loss for the DAO, as arbitrator charges for every arbitration case) if they have done enough reporting the issue and trying to get support through Matrix or Github.\nBugs and requiring arbitration is a bad user experience, so the DAO is also incentivized to keep arbitration and mediation cases at the minimum.\n\n'''How does an arbitrator spends their newly-issued BSQ?\n\nThe arbitrator sells BSQ for BTC from the market and burns BSQ as soon as reimbursement request is paid.\n\n**How does the burningman burn the BSQ they earn or buy?**\n\nBurning is done inside the Bisq software on DAO / Burning / Burningmen.\n\n**Why not simply combine the burning man and arbitrator roles?**\n\nSee longer explanation above. In short: to stay flexible, to be able to implement the target vision (reimbursement done by traders themselves), to avoid legal risks, to keep the arbitrator role scalable, and to address the trust/security issue with the current burning man model.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "bisq1"}

They would evaluate disputes and then sign funds to traders as they saw fit. Since these arbitrators (which we now refer to as ''legacy arbitrators'') had some element of control over users' funds, those who filled the role had to be ''very'' highly trusted.\n\nThe v1.2 update enabled trade funds to be secured in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow, in which arbitrators have **no involvement**. Mediators handle most disputes, but if an arbitrator does get involved, payouts either come from the arbitrator's own pocket or from the Bisq DAO. Arbitrators are still trusted to conduct their role with integrity and consistency, but this is a wholly different kind of trust, one that is unrelated to the handling of users' funds, and thus one that doesn't even require a bond.\n\n## Issue\n\nhttps://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/93\n\n## Team\n\n[https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/refund-agents @bisq-network/refund-agents]\n\n## Duties\n\n* Investigate trader disputes and determine how payout should be made (must respond to traders within 5 days)\n* Do payouts to traders as appropriate with BTC\n* Request BSQ reimbursement from the Bisq DAO\n\n## Rights\n\n* Write access to the Support - Private Matrix room\n\n## Bonding\n\nNot required.\n\n## Finding your arbitrator\n\nTo find your arbitrator see here.\n\nCategory:Roles", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Burning Men", "content": "**Burning Men** is the name given to Bisq contributors who choose to burn BSQ in order to receive bitcoin from Bisq trading activity: Trade fees and Delayed payout transactions. It's an evolution of the previous 'burning man' role. The change, implemented since January 2023 in this [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 proposal], aimed to increase Bisq's decentralization by distributing this role within many contributors. A single burning man could have gone missing, ran away with the BTC before trading them for BSQ and burning these BSQ, or could have been otherwise compromised.\nAs each burning men burns an undetermined amount of BSQ as a condition to receive a share of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, trust requirements and single points of failure are almost nonexistent.\nPlease note: The burningmen protocol described here is entirely different from burns made in Bisq 2 for increasing reputation. Burns made in Bisq 2 do not affect the burningmen protocol.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Contributing as a Burningmen =\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThere are two ways to contribute as a Burningmen. Since the system is not exempt of trust requirements, burningmen need to have provided value to Bisq in the past:\n\n* Contributors who received compensation for their contributions within the last 24 cycles.\n* Contributors who received a BSQ from the DAO genesis transaction.\n\nAfter burning some BSQ (it does not matter if they were previously earned or bought in the BSQ market) they will get a share percentage in the distribution of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions. The more value they've provided to Bisq, the bigger the portion of BSQ they are allowed to burn.\n\n## Considerations before burning BSQ\n\nBurningmen seek profit from burning BSQ, otherwise they would keep their BSQ or sell them for BTC at the market. But profit, coming from estimating the amount of BSQ to burn now to receive a share of future Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, is not granted. There are many sources of uncertainty:\n* Trading volume: affected by BTC trend, Bisq competitors, mining fees, etc.\n* Changes to trade protocol: traders could burn more or less BSQ directly, Delayed payout transactions could be reduced considerably.\n* BSQ/BTC price volatility.\n* BSQ burnt by competing Burningmen.\n\nSince the launch of the Burningmen protocol up to the moment of this writing (Cycle 61), more bitcoin has been distributed to the Burningmen than the bitcoin equivalent amount of BSQ that has been burnt. This means that, historically, burning BSQ has been profitable for most contributors.\nAlthough Bisq provides an estimation of BSQ to burn based in the past, each of the Burningmen should estimate their risk/reward scenarios based in their predictions. Becoming a Burningmen is optional. Depending on how they value the BSQ they have now, the BTC they can obtain on the future, or even if they just want to help Bisq grow, they will not burn BSQ at all, burn all the BSQ from their compensation requests or even buy more BSQ to burn up to their limit.\nThe less competition between Burningmen there is, the more profitable it will be for each of them, and vice versa. The less profitable Burningmen role is, the better for the DAO, as more BSQ is burnt, reducing or containing BSQ supply and therefore pressuring its price up.\n\n= Burning BSQ and receiving BTC =\n\n## Contributors\n\nWhen doing their compensation request, a contributor should fill the \"Burningman receiving address\" with a BTC address to receive the funds to. Once the compensation request is approved, that address will be used for any burning men payouts they receive up until they ever change it in a subsequent approved compensation request. If that field is never completed, an address from Bisq wallet will be used as receiving address.\nIt is highly recommended to use an external wallet like electrum or sparrow, which are able to handle many UTXOs and can connect to a signing device for cold storage.\n\nTo burn BSQ for the BSQ burning man role the current contributor will see their assigned name 'contributor_name' in the Burningmen Protocol UI. They can then choose to burn an amount of BSQ and press burn.\nSince ''Issuance share'' is capped depending on how many BTC were earned in the last 2 years (decaying linearly) it's important to make sure that the amount of BTC to burn will not exceed the cap. It would be prudent to begin with small amounts and never exceed the lower amount in the ''burn target'' column.\n\n## Receivers of the genesis distribution\n\nIf a contributor has funds from the genesis output(s) in their Bisq wallet they will see their assigned name 'Bisq co founder XX' in the Burningmen Protocol UI. They should chose the BTC address to receive funds and follow the instructions in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390#issuecomment-1306075295 github proposal].\n\nBurning BSQ works as described in the second paragraph at contributors section.\n\n= Burning Men Protocol UI =\n\nThe user interface to interact with the Burning Men User protocol user interface can be found at DAO > Proof of Burn > Burning Men.\n\n## Burning Men Candidates fields\n\n* Contributor name: Always use the same name as per github handle when doing compensation requests to avoid duplicated similar contributors with different names and shares.\n* Burn target: Click the ? icon to get more info. Take these numbers as broad estimates and do not use the one on the right as your cap will be exceeded. Even using the left value could make you reach your cap. Do not make decisions based on what to burn on these numbers alone.\n* Receiver share: It informs about the % chance of receiving a trade fee and % amount of the delayed payout transactions you'll receive. It's updated every block and changes based on who burns BSQ **and** the decay over time of the burns made by the burningmen. Each BSQ burnt amount decays linearly to zero over 12 months. To protect the DAO from an attack from a malicious contributor who self trades sending their trades to arbitration, the maximum share each contributor can get is 11%, no matter how many BSQ they burn.\n* Issuance share: It's the amount of BSQ compensation each contributor has received over the last 24 cycles, decaying linearly. Recent contributions have a higher weight. It bears maximum receiver share. A burning man can get a receiver share of up to 10 times their issuance share amount, up to a maximum of 11%. A 0.7% percent issuance share will limit the receiver share to 7%.\n* Burned amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by contributor over time\n* Decayed burn amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by the contributor when taking into account the decay their burns have over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the 'receiver share' value and changes every block.\n* Issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor over time.\n* Decayed issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor when taking into account the decay over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the 'issuance share' value.\n\n## Profit fields\n\nWhen selecting a burningmen, individual profit stats are displayed. It can be filtered by burning, trading fee and/or DPT eventsand by month or individual events. Looking at monthly profits can be used as an indicator of how many BSQ to burn. Note that it's normal to have a negative profit at the beginning, since receiver shares decay linearly over 12 cycles. A burning man should not expect to regain in one month what will be distributed during a longer period.\nScrolling down at the _Profit_ table, it's possible to export all burningman data from a contributor by clicking export to CSV.\n\n## DAO fields\n\nIt gives an overview of BSQ burning and bitcoin distribution across all DAO contributors.\n\n* Total amount of burned BSQ: All time amount of BSQ that has been burnt by all contributors acting as burning men.\n* Total amount of distributed BTC/BSQ: All time amount of bitcoin that has been distributed to all contributors acting as burning men. For ease of comparison this figure is also given as a BSQ amount.\n* Export to CSV: To see the results by month rather than all time in a CSV file, getting a more granular data.\n\nIf the amount of BSQ being distributed is greater than the amount being burnt then the burning men are generally in profit from their activities. If the amount of BSQ being distributed is less than the amount being burnt then the burning men are in a loss from their activities.", "category": "bisq1"}

The person taking the offer will be accepting these terms and conditions by taking the offer.\n\nPlease note it is against Bisq rules to use the 'Additional Information' field to include advertising offers with a way to contact you prior to the trade (e.g. website, phone, email, or Matrix/Keybase/Telegram user name). Doing this can result in a penalty, should someone take your offer and request for you to be penalized.\n\n= Taking a CBM offer =\n\n**Make sure to check the offer maker's terms and conditions before taking a CBM offer.** If you cannot fulfill the terms, do not take the the offer. If you have specific terms you would prefer, consider making your own offer instead.\n\n= Sending cash in the mail =\n\nPlease see the Bisq trade protocol for general trading rules.\n\nIn addition, buyers should:\n\n* Package cash in a tamper-evident cash bag. You can get one at [https://shop.fulmo.org/product/tamper-proof-courier-bags/ the FULMO shop] (the Bisq project gains nothing for providing this link. Fulmo is a friendly member of the Bisq community).\n* Place tamper-evident cash bag inside a parcel. AVOID using an envelope where a postal worker would be able to feel a wad of cash as this can lead to stolen cash.\n* Address the package to the name and address in the seller's cash-by-mail payment account.\n* Put a return address in case the package cannot be delivered.\n* Use inner and outer packaging addressed the same in case the outer one gets ripped open or damaged by water.\n* Seal all packages well, with tape.\n* Follow any special requirements and conditions set by the seller.\n* Film or take high-resolution photos of the cash packaging process with the address and tracking number already affixed to packaging.\n* Send the cash package to the BTC seller with a courier service that requires receipt of delivery to be confirmed by the seller.\n* If it's available, consider using a courier service that has appropriate insurance in place for any issues with delivery (i.e. USPS Registered Mail, insuring packages up to $50,000).\n* Communicate with courier service as required.\n\n**Please make sure you have all the necessary items arranged ''before'' taking an offer (tamper-evident cash bags, other packaging, courier and insurance picked out, etc).**\n\n= Receiving cash in the mail =\n\nWhen receiving cash in the mail, you should:\n\n* Film the opening of the package, making sure that the tracking number provided by the sender is visible in the video.\n* Follow any special requirements and conditions set by the buyer.\n* Communicate with buyer's courier service as required.\n\n= Dispute resolution =\n\nCash-by-mail trades are less verifiable than other fiat trades. This makes handling disputes much harder, so the onus to act honestly is squarely on both peers.\n\nIt is highly recommended for peers to make use of Bisq's trader chat to communicate directly with one another. This is the most promising way to resolve any issues that may arise during the trade.\n\nRegarding dispute resolution, please note:\n\n* Mediators can consider your case and make a suggestion, but they are NOT guaranteed to help.\n* If a mediator is engaged, and if either peer rejects the mediator's suggestion, both peers' funds will be sent to a [https://bisq.wiki/Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction Bisq 'donation' address], and the trade will effectively be completed.\n* If a trader rejects a mediation suggestion and opens arbitration, it could lead to lose both trading and deposit funds.\n* Arbitrators will make a decision based on the evidence provided to them. Therefore, please follow and document the above processes to have evidence in case of dispute. For cash-by-mail trades, arbitrator decisions are final, meaning reimbursement requests to the Bisq DAO for any funds lost in cash-by-mail trades will NOT be considered.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Changing your onion address", "content": "You may want to **generate a new Tor onion address** for your Bisq instance from time to time, primarily as a privacy-enhancing measure. Bisq automatically uses modern Tor v3 addresses (long, 56-character strings). This guide explains the process for forcing Bisq to create a new one.\n\n**Note:** This process changes the onion address your specific Bisq application uses to connect to the Bisq network (peers). It is different from, and does not affect, the Tor addresses of external services Bisq might connect to (like public Bitcoin nodes).\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Important Considerations Before Changing\n\n**CRITICAL WARNING: Do NOT change your onion address if you have any open trades or open disputes.** Doing so will make your Bisq instance unreachable by your peers in those specific contexts. You will be unable to complete those trades or disputes, likely resulting in loss of funds (security deposits or trade amounts).\n\n* **Open offers are OK:** If you only have open *offers* (not accepted trades), it is safe to proceed. Bisq will automatically update your offers with the new onion address when it restarts.\n* **Backup Importance:** This procedure involves deleting a folder. Backing up your **entire Bisq data directory** beforehand is strongly recommended. At a minimum, ensure the `hiddenservice` folder within the Tor directory is backed up (see steps below). This backup allows you to revert to your old address if absolutely necessary (e.g., an unexpected issue arises with a recently completed trade requiring dispute).\n* **Local Reputation Reset:**\n\n## Checking Your Current Onion Address\n\nYou can verify your current Bisq onion address type:\n1. Go to `Settings` > `Network Info`.\n2. Scroll down to the \"Bisq network\" section.\n3. Your address will be displayed. A modern Tor v3 address is a 56-character string. (Older, now deprecated, v2 addresses were 16 characters).\n\n600px|thumb|left|Check your current onion address under Settings > Network Info.\n\n## Step 1: Back Up Your `hiddenservice` Directory\n\n**Before proceeding, ensure Bisq is completely closed.**\n\nNavigate to your data directory. Find the Tor folder within it, relevant to your operating system and network (e.g., `btc_mainnet/tor/`).\n\n**Create a safe backup copy** of the entire `hiddenservice` folder found inside that Tor directory. This folder contains the private keys for your current onion address.\n\n## Step 2: Generate the New Onion Address\n\nWith Bisq still closed and the `hiddenservice` folder safely backed up:\n\n1. **Delete** the original `hiddenservice` folder from your Bisq data directory (the one inside `btc_mainnet/tor/` or similar).\n2. **Restart Bisq.**\n3. **Be Patient:** When Bisq restarts after the `hiddenservice` folder is deleted, it needs to generate new Tor keys and register the new v3 address.\n* This process can take **up to 10 minutes**.\n* It is **resource-intensive** (uses significant RAM). Close other demanding applications beforehand.\n* Bisq **may appear unresponsive** during this time. Do not force quit; let it run.\n4. Once the process completes, Bisq will start normally, and you will have a new Tor v3 onion address. You can verify it under `Settings > Network Info`.\n\nRemember to create new backups that include your new `hiddenservice` folder.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Command line options", "content": "Specifying **command line options** can enable additional non-default settings when running Bisq from the command line.\n\nSee a full list of available options [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/common/src/main/java/bisq/common/config/Config.java#L57 in the code]. This article covers more notable ones for typical use cases.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Specify a different data directory\n\nThe default data directory Bisq uses is called \"Bisq\". All Bisq data is fully contained in it. The default path of this data directory varies based on your operating system. To change the default path too, see below.\n\nYou can specify a different data directory with --appData=BisqTest (change \"BisqTest\" to whatever you want; \"Bisq\" is the default) and Bisq will create a brand new data directory in the default path with a new wallet, keys, onion address, etc (or use the existing data directory with that name if it's already there).\n\nYou can use this option to run more than one instance of Bisq at once, which can be helpful to send funds from one Bisq instance to another when switching to a new data directory.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## Specify a different data directory path\n\nIf you'd like to change the default path for the data directory altogether (e.g. to store the data directory on another drive), run Bisq with --appDataDir=/external/hard/drive/path.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## Dump delayed payout transactions\n\nAdd the --dumpDelayedPayoutTxs=true option to dump delayed payout transactions in the following files in your data directory, inside the db folder:\n\n# delayed_payout_txs_closed.json\n# delayed_payout_txs_pending.json\n# delayed_payout_txs_failed.json\n\n## Specify a Bitcoin node\n\nSometimes Bisq cannot connect to the node specified in the interface at Settings > Network Info, so starting Bisq with --btcNodes= can help.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## See all Bisq trades\n\nSee all Bisq trades by running the --dumpStatistics=true option. Then check out btc_mainnet/db/trade_statistics.json.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## Include command-line options by default\n\nIf there are certain options you'd like to include every time you start Bisq, you can make a script that specifies them for you.\n\nFor example, this script specifies an alternative data directory path on macOS:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appDataDir=/external/hard/drive/path\n\nReplace the Bisq executable path above with the one for your operating system and specify the options you want to include. Then put the script somewhere in your system path so you can easily call it.\n\nOptionally, consider making a dummy directory in the default location to prevent Bisq from accidentally launching in its default mode. To do this, create a directory named \"Bisq\" in the default data directory path for your operating system without any permissions.\n\nFor example, on macOS:\n\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/\n$ mkdir Bisq\n$ chmod 000 Bisq\n\nIn this way, since the system won't have write access in the default location, launching Bisq normally will fail, reminding you to launch Bisq with your script.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "DAO technical overview", "content": "In this **technical overview**, you will see:\n* what BSQ tokens actually are, how they’re created, and how they’re destroyed\n* the various functions of the Bisq DAO and how BSQ enables them\n\nSeveral example transactions are included so you can explicitly see the processes.\n\n## BSQ token\n\nBSQ is a colored coin based on Bitcoin. One BSQ is represented by 100 bitcoin satoshis.\n\nThe colored coin concept does not require OpReturn data but uses the transaction graph to determine if a tx output originates in either the genesis tx or an issuance transaction.\n\nBSQ inherits all the transaction rules from Bitcoin and adds some additional rules. Even though BSQ transactions do not require OP_RETURN, it will be used for certain specialized transactions (voting, compensation requests, etc). Aside from the ancestry to the genesis or an issuance transaction, there is another important rule: the outputs are parsed in a way that the first outputs are interpreted as BSQ as long there is sufficient BSQ value available from the inputs. So the order of BSQ and BTC outputs is essential! For inputs the order is irrelevant. Any violation of those rules would make BSQ invalid. There are many more details which are not currently covered in this document.\n\nWe use the Bisq P2P network as a carrier for content-rich data like that of proposals or voting. The blockchain is used for timestamping that data. Both the P2P network data and the tx are linked together and are used for creating network consensus.\n\nBSQ is a result of blockchain-related data and P2P network data.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe Bisq DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data as well as on data from the Bisq P2P network. Each Bisq application verifies the rules of the DAO. The degree of trust to data delivered from other nodes can be determined by the user. Running a full DAO node requires running bitcoind with RPC enabled. The DAO state can be rebuilt from the genesis transaction. The only remaining trusted entity are then the seed nodes which deliver past P2P network data. As seed node operators are bonded, risk for abuse is very limited. There are (at the moment) 8 seed nodes and all need to be in consensus on P2P network data. The user can see the consensus in the application (Network Monitor tab).\n\n## = Nodes\n=\n\nA user can decide to run the application as lite node or full node. By default it runs as lite node as that does not require any additional setup.\n\n##\nFull nodes\n##\n\nA fully-validating BSQ node requires a Bitcoin Core node to verify blockchain data. RPC is used for communication. Setup details are in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dao-setup.md source code documentation].\n\nFull nodes receive a notification from Bitcoin Core at each new block, scan the block for BSQ transactions and broadcast those to the Bisq P2P network. Every transaction with any BSQ input or output (issuance) is considered a BSQ transaction. The full node also listens to network messages from lite nodes which request BSQ blocks from a certain block height. The full node sends back the list of all blocks since the requested height. The bandwidth requirements for this will depend on the number of BSQ transactions, but rough estimations suggest that there will be no considerable issues. Bisq seed nodes are used as full nodes since those are the first nodes to which a user gets connected and we can use the existing connection to transmit the additional data early in the startup process.\n\n##\nLite nodes\n##\n\nMost users will likely operate in lite node mode. They have to trust the seed node operators that they are not all colluding and holding data back. If at least one operator is honest the lite node can detect a conflict and would re-validate each block from the last snapshot or even from the genesis block. The UI will notify the user about conflicting data from seed nodes.\n\nAt startup, a lite node requests the missing BSQ blocks from the seed node and then validates those blocks to achieve a local state of valid and unspent BSQ outputs. In case of chain splits it can be that one of the seed nodes is on another chain and conflicting blocks get propagated. This would trigger a re-validation of all blocks from the latest snapshot for the lite node. The last received block would be considered the current state but the user will see a message saying there are conflicts (and that it is recommended to wait for more than one confirmation before considering a BSQ transaction as valid). Only after all full nodes (seed nodes) have the same state again will the lite node exit the \"warning\" state. If the user waits for a sufficiently high number of confirmations (4-6) he will not risk that his validation was based on an orphaned chain and that he could become victim of a double spend.\n\n## = Seed nodes\n=\n\nSeed nodes act as providers for P2P network data and filtered blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain for lite nodes. When a node starts, it requests all P2P network data from several seed nodes.\n\n## = External DAO monitor\n=\n\nMonitoring of DAO-related data and infrastructure will be added to [https://monitor.bisq.network/ Bisq monitoring]. This should help us spot any potential consensus or network conflict early.\n\nThis is not deployed at the moment, but will be integrated soon.\n\n## = BSQ block explorer\n=\n\n[https://explorer.bisq.network/ BSQ block explorers] show all BSQ transactions with some metadata (transaction type, etc). It gives also some statistical data about the network. It is a very basic version at the moment, but we are working on a more sophisticated version. Any BSQ transaction can be looked up in a normal Bitcoin block explorer as well, but of course those explorers will not show any DAO-related context. If looking up a BSQ address on a normal Bitcoin block explorer, a user needs to remove the B prefix so the address is considered a valid BTC address.\n\n## BSQ integration in Bisq\n\nThe Bisq DAO and BSQ are fully integrated into the Bisq UI. It comes with a BSQ wallet and UI for creating proposals, participating in voting, and taking part in other DAO functions.\n\n## = Wallet\n=\n\nThe Bisq application provides an integrated BSQ wallet with basic features for receiving and sending BSQ, as well as a transaction history screen. The wallet is based on [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki BIP 44] and uses [https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md registered coin type 142]. This provides extra protection against the risk of accidentally using the BSQ wallet as a BTC wallet (e.g., when restoring from seed words). To avoid users from needing to backup 2 different sets of seed words, we use the same seed for both the BSQ and the BTC wallets, even though they are stored in different files. To further avoid mixing BSQ with normal Bitcoin, we use a \"B\" as address prefix for BSQ addresses in the user interface. Internally that prefix does not exist, as a BSQ address is a normal BTC address, and BSQ transactions are normal BTC transactions.\n\nBSQ token transactions and balances are represented inside the application but there is also a web-based [https://explorer.bisq.network/ BSQ block explorer].\n\nA BSQ transaction is valid only after a blockchain confirmation. However, for better usability, we allow users to spend their own change outputs. This involves no risk, as a user would render all follow-up transactions invalid if he tries to double-spend. Unconfirmed BSQ received from others is not spendable.\n\n## = Application internal DAO monitor\n=\n\nInside the application we maintain a hash chain of states and P2P network data. The overall DAO state gets hashed at each new block which contains the previous hash, thus forming a chain of hashes. If the last hash is correct, all the previous must be correct as well. Each node receives the last 10 hashes from seed nodes and compares it with its local hash. If there is any conflict, it shows a warning and requests to rebuild the DAO state. At each new block, each peer broadcasts its local hash to its neighbors. That way, the node also receives hashes from normal peers.\n\nSimilar to DAO states, we also maintain a hash chain for proposal data and blind vote data. These hashes are created only once per voting cycle at an appropriate block height (i.e., when it is expected that the whole network has received all data).\n\nThere are valid cases when consensus could be temporarily broken. In case of a chain split, nodes can have different DAO states, as the Bitcoin block hash is part of the data, and if 2 nodes are on a different chain they will have different block hashes.\n\nIn case some P2P network data was not distributed well in the network, there may be temporary conflicts of the relevant hash chains. An application restart should usually resolve such issues. If not, rebuilding the DAO state forces all P2P network data to be reloaded.\n\n## = Snapshots\n=\n\nTo avoid reevaluating all history at each startup, we use a snapshot mechanism.\n\nEvery 20 blocks a snapshot mechanism is triggered. The current state is cloned and kept in memory, and if a previous clone exists, it is persisted. At the next snapshot trigger event, the last clone is persisted and a new clone is cached. In this way, the snapshot is always at least 20 blocks old.\n\nThe lite node requests the blocks since the latest snapshot only, so that will usually be 20-40 blocks (maximum). The only exception to this is on first startup after a new install, when a lite node only has the snapshot shipped with the binary—in this case, requested blocks might consume a bit more bandwidth.\n\nIf we maintain a monthly release schedule, there can be about 4500 blocks in a month, but even with that we expect not more than 1-5 MB of bandwidth to receive the initial blockchain data.\n\n## = Snapshots shipped in releases\n=\n\nEach application release is updated with a recent snapshot version of the DAO state. This data will be used for new users who have not created their own snapshot yet. This saves new users from needing to download all historical data and rebuilding DAO state from genesis.\n\nThe user still can rebuild from genesis if he does not want to trust that developers have shipped a correct snapshot. Any discrepancy would be easily detected.\n\n## Blockchain-related data\n\nOne part of the DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data. We only use the blockchain for timestamping. Transactions do not carry content-rich data—this data is stored on the Bisq P2P network.\n\nList of possible BSQ transaction types:\n\n* Genesis tx\n* Transfer BSQ tx\n* Trade fee tx\n* Proposal tx\n* Compensation request tx\n* Reimbursement request tx\n* Blind vote tx\n* Vote reveal tx\n* Lockup tx\n* Unlock tx\n* Asset listing fee tx\n* Proof of burn tx\n\nIn addition, a transaction can be unverified, invalid or irregular.\n\nUnverified is the default state for all unconfirmed BSQ transactions. Validation is done once a tx is confirmed.\n\nInvalid transactions are transactions which have violated validation rules. BSQ are destroyed in such transactions.\n\nIrregular transactions are transactions which are invalid with their intended use but have not destroyed their BSQ. An example is a proposal tx which got confirmed too late (not in proposal phase) and therefore is invalid as a proposal tx, but the BSQ is still valid to be spent.\n\n## = Genesis tx\n=\n\nBTC from the donation address was used to fund the input for the genesis tx. The genesis tx issued 3,657,480 BSQ, which is equivalent to 3.65748 BTC. The amount of 3,657,480 BSQ is the sum of the 2,500,000 BSQ which was distributed as symbolic [https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/2f194230e23459a9211322c4b1c182cf3f367086e8059aca2f8f44e20dac527a testnet BSQ] to past contributors back in July 2017 and 1,157,480 BSQ contributors have earned since starting [https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html Phase Zero] in October 2017.\n\nThe outputs are the BSQ addresses of all contributors who have contributed to Bisq before we start the DAO on mainnet. All outputs are by definition valid BSQ. The genesis tx is funded with the exact amount, including the miner fee, so there is no change output.\n\n## = Transfer BSQ tx\n=\n\nSending BSQ to another address is a simple transaction without OpReturn. It requires a BSQ input for the transferred BSQ as well as a BTC input to cover the miner fee. The outputs are the receiver's BSQ address, an optional BSQ change output, and an optional BTC change output.\n\nA transaction to send 10 BSQ could look like this:\n\n* Input 1: 30.00 BSQ (BSQ sender)\n* Input 2: 0.01 BTC (required BTC for mining fee)\n* Output 1: 10.00 BSQ (BSQ receiver)\n* Output 1: 20.00 BSQ (BSQ change output back to sender)\n* Output 2: 0.0095 BTC (BTC change output)\n* Mining fee: 0.0005\n\n## = Trade fee tx\n=\n\nWe invalidate a small amount of BSQ for the trade fee payment. Since the burned amount is used as miner fee and not\nas a regular tx output, we are not restricted by the dust limit of 546 satoshis, and can spend fees as little as 0.01 BSQ (equivalent to 1 BTC satoshi). The fee is the difference of the BSQ input and the BSQ output.\n\nA BSQ trade fee payment tx could look like this (for a fee with 0.5 BSQ):\n\n* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 9.50 BSQ\n* Output 2: 0.09950050 BTC change output\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049950 BTC + 0.00000050 BTC or 0.50 BSQ)\n\nIn this case, we only used 9.50 BSQ of the 10.00 BSQ from the input. Since the second output is spending more than the remaining 0.50 BSQ, it is an invalid BSQ output so we consider it a BTC output. The remaining 0.50 BSQ which was not used in the first output will be used for the mining fee, thus reducing the mining fee which is paid from the BTC input (input 2).\n\n## = Proposal tx\n=\n\nA proposal transaction contains an OpReturn output which indicates the type and carries the hash of the\nproposal payload data.\n\n* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee\n* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Output [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: 0x10\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 20 bytes for hash of proposal payload\n\nThe hash is created from the bytes of the proposal payload with tx ID set to null using protobuffer serialization.\nIt is first hashed with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160 to get a 20 byte hash.\n\nExample with a 2 BSQ fee:\n\n* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 8 BSQ\n* Output 2: 0.09950200 BTC change output\n* Output 3: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)\n\n## = Compensation request tx/Reimbursement request tx\n=\n\nCompensation request tx and reimbursement request txs are technically the same and inherit the properties of a\nproposal tx but have some additional requirements. They add a BTC output which will be interpreted as a BSQ output at the vote result phase in case the request is accepted by voting.\n\n* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee\n* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs BSQ issuance and miner fee\n* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)\n* Outputs [1]: Issuance candidate output; before voted ok it is BTC afterwards newly issued BSQ\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Outputs [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: Compensation request tx: 0x11 / Reimbursement request: 0x12\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 20 bytes for hash of request payload\n\nExample with a 2 BSQ fee and requested issuance amount of 5000 BSQ:\n\n* Input 1: 10.00 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 8 BSQ\n* Output 2: 0.00500000 BTC (5000 BSQ after positive voting)\n* Output 3: 0.09950200 BTC change output\n* Output 4: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)\n\n## = Blind vote tx\n=\n\nThe blind vote tx contains the hash of the blind vote payload and uses the vote stake as input. The stake is blocked from spending during this phase and is only unlocked by the vote reveal tx. If another transaction spends the stake, the blind vote becomes invalid. The blind vote requires a fee in BSQ.\n\n* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee + stake\n* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output of stake\n* Output [0-1] Optional BSQ change output\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Output [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: 0x13\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 20 bytes for hash of encrypted votes\n\nTo create the encrypted votes we use following data:\n\n* Secret key: 128 bit AES key.\n* List of a tuple of proposal Tx IDs + vote, sorted by tx ID. Only valid proposals of current cycle are included.\n\nWe use protobuffer serialisation for the bytes which will be encrypted with the secret key.\n\nExample with a 2 BSQ fee and 7000 BSQ vote stake:\n\n* Input 1: 8000.00 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 7000 BSQ / 0.00700000 BTC\n* Output 2: 998 BSQ change output\n* Output 3: 0.09950200 BTC change output\n* Output 4: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049800 BTC + 0.00000200 BTC or 2 BSQ)\n\n## = Vote reveal tx\n=\n\nThe vote reveal tx consumes the stake output from the blind vote tx as the only BSQ input. It does not require a BSQ fee.\n\nIn the OpReturn data we add the secret key for decrypting our blind vote and a hash of the blind vote list to ensure consensus of the P2P network data used in voting. This hash will be used in the vote result phase to determine a majority in case different users get a different list of blind votes, which would lead to different vote results, and therefore cause consensus failures.\n\n* Input [1]: BSQ input -> stake output of blind vote tx\n* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [1]: BSQ output (unlocked stake)\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Output [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: 0x14\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 20 bytes for hash of blind vote list\n* 16 bytes secretKey\n\nThe hash of the blind vote list is made using all blind vote payload data received in the cycle and sorted by blind vote tx ID.\nThe secretKey is the encoded byte representation of the secret key.\n\nExample with 7000 BSQ stake:\n\n* Input 1: 7000 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 7000 BSQ\n* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC\n* Output 3: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC\n\n## = Lockup tx\n=\n\nThe lock tx can be use for locking up funds for a bonded role or for bonded reputation: a certain amount of BSQ is locked for a defined lock time (in blocks). Only an unlock tx can unlock locked funds. Once the unlock tx is confirmed, the lock time will be used to determine when the funds can be used in a normal transaction again. While funds are locked, they cannot be moved, or they are invalidated. While funds are locked, or are in an unlocking state, funds can be confiscated by voting.\n\n* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs\n* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [1]: Locked up BSQ\n* Outputs [0-1]: BSQ change output\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Output [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: 0x15\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 1 byte for lockup reason (bonded role 0x01, reputation 0x02)\n* 2 bytes for lock time (see: bisq.common.util.Utilities.integerToByteArray for encoding)\n* 20 bytes for hash\n\nThe hash in case of a bonded role is created from immutable data of the bonded role. Currently we use hashCode but that should be changed to a cryptographic hash.\nThe hash for a reputation is derived from a salt. The salt is by default a random string as hex or can be any string defined by the user.\n\nExample with locking up 4000 BSQ:\n\n* Input 1: 6000 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 4000 BSQ lockup\n* Output 1: 2000 BSQ change output\n* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC\n* Output 3: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC\n\n## = Unlock tx\n=\n\nThe unlock tx takes the lockup tx output and use the lock time encoded in the OpReturn to determine the unlock time.\nThe BSQ output cannot be used in another tx until the lock time is over. During that time it is in the unlocking state.\nAfterwards it is in the unlocked state and can be spent like any normal BSQ output.\n\n* Input [1]: BSQ input from lockup tx lockup output (output index 0)\n* Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [1]: BSQ unlock output\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee\n\nExample with unlocking 4000 BSQ:\n\n* Input 1: 4000 BSQ (from lockup tx output)\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 4000 BSQ unlocking/unlocked state\n* Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC\n\n## = Asset listing fee tx\n=\n\nThe asset listing fee tx is used for paying listing fees for an asset. The ticker symbol of the asset is specified in the OpReturn data to bind the tx to a specific asset.\nIf the BSQ fee is more than the required mining fee, we do not use a BTC input, and add the remaining BTC to the BTC output.\n\n* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for listing fee\n* Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - fee)\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Output [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: 0x16\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 20 bytes for hash of ticker symbol\n\nWe take the bytes of the ticker symbol as UTF-8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.\n\nExample with a BSQ fee of 20 BSQ:\n\n* Input 1: 100.00 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 80 BSQ\n* Output 2: 0.0997 BTC\n* Output 3: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)\n\n## = Proof of burn tx\n=\n\nA user can put the hash of an arbitrary string (pre-image) into a proof of burn tx and burn a specified amount of\nBSQ. He can later use the pre-image to prove to any party that he has created that hash. He can also sign any challenge\nmessage and the challenger can verify that he is the key holder of the first input used in that tx.\n\n* Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for burned amount\n* Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee\n* Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - burned amount)\n* Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output\n* Output [1]: OP_RETURN with OpReturnData and amount 0\n* Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee\n\nOpReturn data:\n\n* 1 byte for tx type: 0x16\n* 1 byte for version: 0x01\n* 20 bytes for hash of pre image\n\nWe take the bytes of the pre-image as UTF-8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.\n\nExample with 20 BSQ burned:\n\n* Input 1: 100.00 BSQ\n* Input 2: 0.1 BTC\n* Output 1: 80 BSQ\n* Output 2: 0.0997 BTC\n* Output 3: OpReturn data\n* Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)\n\n## P2P network payloads\n\nProposals and blind vote data are published over the Bisq P2P network. They must be published in the correct phase and cycle, otherwise they are considered invalid. Each node listens for these messages and persists the data locally. At startup, each node receives missing data from seed nodes. The corresponding tx ID is part of the data and is used to map the data to the transaction. The hash of the P2P network data is part of the OpReturn data in the transactions. In this way, we can verify that the mapping of a tx to the data is correct in both directions.\n\n## = Temporary proposal payload\n=\n\nDuring the proposal phase the user can add and remove proposals. For removing we use the public key which was added when publishing a proposal and verify with a signature if the remove attempt is coming from the same owner. This is the same model as we use in other P2P network data like offer payloads. The data has a time to live of 60 days, and after that, it is removed from local storage.\n\n## = Proposal payload\n=\n\nThere are several different types of proposals:\n\n* Compensation request\n* Reimbursement requests\n* Proposal for changing a parameter\n* Proposal for a bonded role\n* Proposal for confiscating a bond\n* Generic proposal\n* Proposal for removing an asset\n\nThe proposal contains the tx ID of the proposal transaction. When creating the transaction we add the 20-byte hash of\nthe proposal data to the OpReturn data of the proposal tx. As the tx ID would be part of the proposal data and cannot be\nknown before the tx is created, we leave it empty and set it afterwards. That way we get a mapping in both directions and\ncan verify later that a proposal payload has a valid tx and that the tx data matches the proposal data.\n\nDuring the break after the proposal phase, all nodes publish their proposal payload, which uses proposals from the temporary\nproposal payload. This data is now immutable and will be used for voting.\n\n## = Blind vote payload\n=\n\nBlind vote data are published when the user makes his blind vote tx and are managed in the same way as proposal payloads (append-only data).\n\n## Governance\n\nGovernances takes place in regularly-occurring voting cycles. A cycle consists of 4 distinct phases.\n\n## = Phases\n=\n\nPhases are defined by block height. Each phase is separated with a break to avoid issues with reorgs.\n\nHere are the phases and the initial duration values (they can be changed by voting):\n\n* Proposal phase (compensation requests, etc): 3600 blocks, about 25 days\n* Break: 150 blocks\n* Blind vote phase (approve/decline proposals): 450 blocks, about 3 days\n* Break: 10 blocks\n* Vote reveal phase: 450 blocks, about 3 days\n* Break: 10 blocks\n* Result phase: 10 blocks\n\nThe full cycle will last 4680 blocks which is about one month if one block takes an average of 10 minutes.\n\n##\nProposal phase\n##\n\nAny BSQ stakeholder can publish a temporary proposal payload during the proposal phase, as well as remove their own proposals.\n\n##\nBlind Vote phase\n##\n\nA BSQ stakeholder can vote on any proposal with 3 options: accept, decline or ignore. Not voting on a proposal is the same as ignoring it.\n\nThe user defines how much _stake_ they want to put into their vote. The higher the stake, the higher the vote weight compared to other voters. In addition to the stake, _merit_ is added if the user has earned BSQ in previous cycles through accepted compensation requests. The merit value of each issuance ages linearly over time: it reaches 0 after 100 000 blocks (about 2 years). Aged accumulated merit is automatically added to the stake, and the sum of both is the vote weight.\n\nWhen creating the blind vote tx, the user also publishes the blind vote payload. We use the same linking of tx ID and payload hash to map them together.\n\n##\nVote reveal phase\n##\n\nUpon entering the vote reveal phase, each voter automatically publishes their vote reveal tx. There is no fee required for this transaction beside the miner fee. No P2P network data is published.\n\n##\nVote result phase\n##\n\nIn the vote result phase, all nodes calculate the vote result on all proposals and apply the result to the overall BSQ state.\n\nThis process uses the hash of the blind vote list from the vote reveal tx to determine the winning majority, in case users had different P2P network payloads of blind votes. The majority is calculated by stake (not merit) of the voters. Only if at least 80% of the network has the same hash is the cycle is valid, otherwise, all proposals and requests are considered rejected.\n\nA proposal is considered accepted if the required quorum and threshold are reached. Quorum is the minimum amount of accumulated vote weight in BSQ which is required. Threshold is the relationship of accepted votes to total votes. Each proposal type has different quorum and threshold parameters which can be changed by voting, but threshold can never be below 50.01%.\n\nIn case a proposal's data is not available, it is rejected. In case there are 2 accepted change parameter proposals for changing the same parameter to 2 different values, we reject both as it shows there is a social consensus issue in the DAO.\n\n## = DAO Parameters\n=\n\nThere are many different parameters which can be changed by voting.\nTrading fees, voting parameters (threshold and quorum), durations of the phases, and many more.\n\nSee the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/3854907c14357680038661c8153095a157efbc5d/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/governance/param/Param.java Param class] for a complete list.\n\n## = Bonded roles\n=\n\nAll roles in the Bisq DAO which can potentially create severe damage are handled as bonded roles. To become a role owner one need to make a request for a bonded role, and once accepted by voting, the person needs to lock up the defined bond. The role only is only considered active when the bond is locked up.\n\nThe required amount for the bond is defined in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/497e202420940372fa1a344f64d375eac710d299/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/state/model/governance/BondedRoleType.java BondedRoleType enum]. The unlock time is 110 days for all roles.\n\nIn severe cases, BSQ stakeholders can make a proposal to confiscate a bond. This will require a very high threshold in voting and is considered an exceptional case which hopefully never happens.\n\nMost bonded roles are connected to environments which cannot interact with the Bisq DAO directly. For example, the Github Admin role cannot be revoked by confiscating the role owner as the Bisq DAO has no power over GitHub. The only exceptions are mediators and arbitrators, since people can be verified as valid bonded role owners before they are used for dispute resolution. This is not implemented yet and will be part of the new trade protocol update in the next few months.\n\n## = Bonded reputation\n=\n\nSimilar to bonded roles, a user can lock up a bond to prove reputation. There is no concrete use case for this in Bisq at the moment, but we might use it in the future for new forms of trade protocols which are based on bonded reputation.\n\n## = Asset listing fee\n=\n\nAssets added to Bisq need to gain enough traders to reach a minimum trade volume over a certain time period. These parameters are DAO parameters and can be changed by voting. If an asset does not satisfy these parameters, such as trading volume thresholds, it will be removed from the list of assets when creating an altcoin payment account or selecting the preferred currencies in the software preferences.\n\nAnyone can pay a fee in BSQ to gain access to a trial period where requirements to reach trade volume thresholds are lifted. Usually the coin issuers do this, but it can be done by anyone interested in trading a particular asset. The fee is initially 1 BSQ per day for a trial period, with a minimum of 30 days. The fee can be changed by voting.\n\nIf an asset gets removed by a Remove Asset Proposal, it can no longer be reactivated by the listing fee. Listing fees already paid are lost in this case.\n\n## = Proof of burn\n=\n\nThis advanced feature does not have a concrete use at the moment, but might be used in the future. Burning BSQ can be used as a form of reputation. If one is willing to burn some money, and can use that proof for other activities (e.g. securing a trade), they might be interested that this form of reputation by burning BSQ will not become pointless in case he was publicly proven as scammer. The user can prove that he was the originator of the transaction by providing the pre-image to a hash, which gets added to the OpReturn data and he can sign any challenge message to prove he had funded the transaction. We use the EC key from the first input for the signature.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis document does not cover all details and cannot be used as basis for implementation of BSQ features or for\ncreating self-crafted transactions. The source code is the only real specification. It is NOT recommended to create custom BSQ transactions, as tiny mistakes can lead to destroyed BSQ. Bisq developers will not be concerned with transactions which might be valid with the current rule set but which have not been created by the Bisq application. In the future, updated rules might become more strict and might break such externally-created transactions. Requirements for backward compatibility will only consider use cases and tx structures created by the Bisq application.\n\nPlease note that currently it is not recommended to send BSQ to a hardware wallet. Handling the miner fee might cause invalidation of the BSQ funds or cause losses if precious BSQ is used to pay the miner fee. We will publish some instructions how to do this in a safe way soon.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "DAO user reference", "content": "This **DAO user reference** covers practical details on the workings of the Bisq DAO for traders and contributors.\n\nSome basic DAO functions like paying trading fees, making proposals, and voting may not seem complex, but implementing these functions on peer-to-peer networks (Bitcoin and Bisq’s own P2P network) adds extensive technical complexity.\n\nImmense technical challenges aside, the practical constraints of the Bisq DAO are not trivial. One requirement is complete decentralization of decision-making (no persons with special powers) and funding (no central wallets or accounts to store and distribute funds). Another is that incentives must be so well-aligned that stakeholders are naturally motivated to grow and support the DAO merely by acting rationally—there are no managers to promote you (or fire you).\n\nAnd perhaps most critically, the DAO needs to be secure: safe from hackers and scammers trying to take advantage of the DAO and its users.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## BSQ Token\n\nContributors earn BSQ for working on Bisq, and traders spend BSQ to trade on Bisq. This basic dynamic is covered in the DAO introduction article and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvOZlIDYEQ&list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e in this video series].\n\nBut what actually ''is'' BSQ, and where does it come from?\n\nA single BSQ token is denominated as 100 satoshis (i.e., it's represented on the Bitcoin blockchain as 0.00000100 BTC). This bitcoin is 'colored' with additional properties that causes Bisq software to recognize it as BSQ.\n\nBSQ can only be created in one of two ways:\n\n# through the genesis distribution (detailed below)\n# through an issuance transaction (compensation request or reimbursement request)\n\n## = BSQ Genesis Distribution\n=\n\nThe Bisq DAO did not launch with a supply of zero BSQ tokens. An initial supply of BSQ tokens was created to account for all the contributions to the Bisq project before the mainnet launch of the Bisq DAO.\n\nThese contributions can be divided into 2 segments.\n\n**1. Before October 2017**\n\nIn the early days of the project, before Bisq tracked compensation requests and voting results, Bisq collected donations. In October 2017, as part of the implementation of the Phase Zero plan, it was decided that 2.5 BTC of all donations would be distributed back to these patrons as BSQ where each person would receive an amount proportional to their prior contributions.\n\n**2. After October 2017**\n\nIn October 2017, the plan outlined in the Phase Zero plan went into effect. Subsequent contributions to Bisq were [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues documented on GitHub] and stakeholders voted to approve those contributions [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlXDswj3251BPCOcII-UyWlX7o7jMkfYBE-IZ5te5Ck on this spreadsheet].\n\nThe genesis BSQ distribution issued the sum of both these segments of past contributions.\n\nUltimately, the genesis transaction issued [https://mempool.space/bisq/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 3,657,480 BSQ to over 200 past contributors]. You can see [https://mempool.space/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 the corresponding Bitcoin transaction here].\n\nAddresses were confirmed over email, Slack, Twitter, and on these two GitHub threads: [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/260 one], [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/263 two].\n\n## Bisq DAO\n\n## = Technical Overview\n=\n\nThere are 2 key points to note about how the Bisq DAO works.\n\n**1. Every DAO action is an on-chain Bitcoin transaction.**\n\nEvery DAO action requires BSQ, and since BSQ is bitcoin, every DAO action is also recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. As noted above, this does NOT mean you should try to form your own BSQ transactions. But it does mean that every action you take on the Bisq DAO is immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain, publicly verifiable, and virtually impossible to reverse.\n\n**2. Bitcoin provides transaction integrity, and Bisq's own P2P network provides storage.**\n\nDAO actions such as making proposals and voting include extra data such as text and links that don't belong on the Bitcoin blockchain. This extra data is stored on Bisq's own P2P network (literally, Bisq users' hard drives). A hash of that extra data is included in the OP_RETURN output of the corresponding Bitcoin transaction. Then, the Bitcoin transaction ID is added to the extra data and broadcast to peers on the Bisq network.\n\nYou can visualize it like this:\n\nthumb|left|600px|How Bisq DAO data is stored\n\nStoring a hash of the extra data on the Bitcoin blockchain ensures any attempts to manipulate it will fail, since the hash of the manipulated data will change and then not match the hash recorded in the corresponding Bitcoin transaction.\n\n**For a more thorough treatment of the technical workings of the Bisq DAO, see the technical overview article.**\n\n## = Voting Cycle\n=\n\nVoting cycles are timed to last about 1 month. Duration is measured in blocks, so actual calendar/clock times may vary.\n\n##\nProposal Phase\n##\n\n''3600 blocks, about 24 days''\n\nDuring this time, Bisq stakeholders (contributors and traders) can make proposals. It is not possible to edit a proposal, but it is possible to remove a proposal and submit a corrected one (only during this phase).\n\nThere is a small fee to make proposals to discourage spam. Fees for proposals that are removed are not reimbursed.\n\nProposals requesting the issuance of new BSQ will also require a small amount of BTC to be included in the proposal transaction so there is BTC to 'color' into BSQ. The spec requires 100 satoshis per BSQ token, so a request for 1000 BSQ will require 1000 × 100 = 100,000 satoshis.\n\nKeep in mind that the actual BSQ you end up with will be net the proposal fee: if your request for 1000 BSQ is approved, and if the proposal fee is 2 BSQ, you will end up with 998 BSQ in your wallet.\n\nFor compensation requests, please make sure you follow established conventions and recommendations.\n\nIf the proposal phase ends before you can make your proposal, simply wait and make your proposal in the next proposal phase.\n\n##\n= Other Details\n##\n=\n\nAs illustrated in the image above, proposal transactions are published on the Bitcoin network and proposal data objects are broadcast on the Bisq P2P network. The Bitcoin transaction includes a hash of the proposal data object.\n\nAfter the proposal phase is over, there is a break of 150 blocks (about 1 day) to review and discuss proposals before voting begins.\n\n##\nBlind Voting Phase\n##\n\n''450 blocks, about 3 days''\n\nYou may approve, reject, or abstain from casting a vote on proposals. It is highly recommended that you only approve or reject proposals for which you can make a well-informed decision.\n\nIt is not necessary to have made a proposal to be able to vote—any stakeholder (anyone with BSQ) can participate in voting.\n\nOnce you have made your selections, you must specify a stake and publish your votes.\n\nVotes cannot be changed once they are published.\n\n##\n= Voting Stake\n##\n=\n\nYour voting weight is determined by 2 factors: **reputation** (how much BSQ you've earned), and **stake** (how much of your owned BSQ you allot to your vote) that you specify in your vote transaction.\n\n''Reputation'' is the amount of BSQ earned by doing work for the Bisq network, independent of the amount of BSQ spent or sold. So if Alice earns 10,000 BSQ by working on Bisq, and she sells 8,000 BSQ for BTC to pay her bills, her reputation value remains 10,000 BSQ. Caveat: reputation decays over time. BSQ earned decays linearly over a period of 2 years as soon as it's earned. So the reputation value of Alice's 10,000 BSQ is 5,000 BSQ one year after she earns it, and zero two years later.\n\nReputation cannot be specified when making a vote transaction—it's automatically calculated for the user from their past contributions.\n\n''Stake'' is the literal amount of BSQ specified for the vote transaction. This is BSQ you own that you would like to devote to your vote. The more BSQ you allot, the more weight your vote will hold. BSQ specified for stake is unspendable for the duration of the voting cycle.\n\n**Total voting weight is the sum of reputation value and specified stake.**\n\nBSQ earned is worth more than BSQ bought. The idea is that there is no better measure of good-will and dedication to the project than actually working on the project. The arrangement still allows people who buy into the project considerable influence, while hopefully minimizing the potential of whales with bad intentions from buying their way in and sabotaging the project.\n\n##\n= Other Details\n##\n=\n\nVotes are published on the Bitcoin network and ''encrypted'' vote data objects are broadcast on the Bisq P2P network (hence the term 'blind' vote). The Bitcoin transaction includes a hash of the vote data object. BSQ specified for voting stake is also specified in this transaction, and cannot be spent until the vote reveal transaction is published.\n\nFollowing the end of the blind voting phase, there is a break of 10 blocks to protect against reorgs.\n\n##\nVote Reveal Phase\n##\n\n''450 blocks, about 3 days''\n\nNo action is required of the user during this phase aside from having the Bisq software online at some point during the vote reveal phase so it can publish the vote reveal transaction.\n\nYou will see a pop-up in the UI when the transaction has been published.\n\n##\n= Other Details\n##\n=\n\nOnly a Bitcoin transaction is made in this phase—no additional data is broadcast to the Bisq P2P network.\n\nThis transaction includes 2 items:\n\n# the key to decrypt the votes cast in the blind voting phase\n# a hash of the list of voting data objects received by the Bisq node making the transaction (ordered by transaction ID; details below\n\nOne of the inputs to this transaction is the BSQ reserved for stake, so once this transaction is published, that BSQ becomes spendable again.\n\nIf a user fails to make their vote reveal transaction, their vote is rendered invalid.\n\nAgain, for protection against reorgs, there is a break of 10 blocks after this phase is over.\n\n##\nVote Result Phase\n##\n\n''10 blocks, about 100 minutes''\n\nThis phase is more of a trigger, so allotting 10 blocks is more for consistency than a hard requirement.\n\nIn this phase, Bisq nodes calculate vote results from proposals, voting stake, and votes (which can now be decrypted from the vote reveal transactions).\n\n##\n= Determining Consensus\n##\n=\n\nWe can trust that all Bisq nodes will get the same data from the Bitcoin blockchain. However, we cannot be sure that all Bisq nodes have obtained all corresponding data from the Bisq P2P network. It is critical that any potential inconsistencies be handled before determining vote results, otherwise, vote results may differ.\n\nThis is why each Bisq node includes a hash of the list of the voting data objects it has received in its vote reveal transaction. While a hash of vote data objects is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain for integrity, it's not guaranteed that every ''voting data object itself'' is actually delivered to every Bisq node.\n\nSo, when calculating vote results, the majority hash from the vote reveal transactions (majority by voting stake) is considered to be the authoritative representation of votes for the whole network. Vote result calculations are based on this uniform determination, ensuring consensus across the network.\n\nThis threshold was tested in Cycle 20. The majority hash lacked the requisite 80% voting stake consensus because of Tor network issues, so results were invalidated, and there was zero issuance. See [https://bisq.network/blog/cycle-20-results/ more details here].\n\n## Note on Unexpected Situations\n\nGreat care has been taken to make sure that there are no opportunities for the Bisq DAO to be exploited by scammers, hackers, or others with bad intentions.\n\nMuch expertise and theory went into the Bisq DAO's conception, implementation was careful, and testing was thorough. The resulting software is the best expression of the intention of these collective efforts, but it may not be infallible.\n\n**We say this to establish that Bisq DAO code is not law.** It has clear intentions, and every effort will be made to fix unintended results.\n\nWhile we hope nothing will be catastrophic enough to require it, hard forks, confiscation, and new issuances are options to deal with extreme scenarios. BSQ trading and DAO operations can be halted through an alert message from the lead developer. Such messages may be ignored by users if they think the measure is being abused, but ignoring such messages in a situation where the measure ''is'' justified may exclude the user from reimbursement in case of losses.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Data Privacy", "content": "As Bisq is a peer to peer trading system, there is no central server for storing account information. Only the two people involved in a P2P trade know the details of that trade. If mediation or arbitration is opened, the mediator or arbitrator are provided with the trade details too.\n\nThe trade parameters are stored on those participants' computers. That is much better than having the data stored in centralized servers, but still is not ideal. Bisq users may trade with lots of people over time and those details can accumulate. If their computer were lost stolen or seized, unwelcome individuals might gain access to that information, which in the case of more popular trading methods would be account names and numbers.\n\nTo mitigate that risk, Bisq has introduced a [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/6001 feature] to clear account related information from closed trades after a certain grace period has passed. As always, you are in charge of your own Bisq instance and so this grace period can be configured to best suit your preference. It is configured by the field \"Clear sensitive data after (days)\" in the Settings screen. Once a trade has finished, it is unlikely that you ever need to see your trading peer's payment account information, as it was only required to make and/or verify that payment. So a good rule of thumb would probably be the default setting of 60 days, or lower. After a closed trade has passed the grace period, Bisq clears maker/taker payment account payloads from the trade, as well as trader chats. The same applies to any Mediation/Arbitration dispute linked to the trade. (Note that the grace period is measured from the trade date, so for example if you did a trade on 1st January, and it completed on the 5th of January the account information would be cleared on the 1st March based on the default setting of 60 days.)\n\nThat's all there is to it, a privacy preserving effort we can all take part in to keep Bisq useful and safe for all, especially for your past trade peers whose details you might have the liability to protect.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Deposit transaction pending in mempool and CPFP", "content": "The following article is directed at users who have at least intermediate knowledge of Bitcoin, and the suggested technique is not officially supported, meaning that if you lose funds because of mistakes, you are the only accountable party.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Basic fee considerations =\n\nA trade on Bisq can only start after the deposit transaction has been mined into a block (one confirmation is enough), so the application will choose the optimal miner fee based on how mempool is busy at the moment the taker accepts the maker's offer. There are two different edge cases which Bisq is not able to account for, and that will delay the first confirmation, if not prevent it entirely from happening:\n* sudden spikes of transactions in mempool (think about a bull run, or central exchanges flooding the blockchain with consolidation txs, or a new hype like inscriptions)\n* traders funding Bisq wallet at a fee which is too low to be confirmed in current mempool, and then using the unconfirmed utxo to fund the deposit tx (this will cause a Child Pays For Parent -more on this below- on the original funding tx and possible unconfirmed precursors, that will decrease the effective fee rate of the actual deposit transaction)\n\nCommonly, it is a combination of the two that happens: mempool becomes progressively busier, and at the same time one of the traders (or even worse, both) send funds from an external wallet to be used for the deposit transaction, selecting an inadequate fee that will bring down the effective fee rate.\n\n= What happens when fee is too low =\n\nBitcoin transactions can either be confirmed, or not, so the deposit transaction will be pending in mempool until one of two outcomes occurs:\n* it is finally included in a block (trade will start normally, even with a large delay)\n* it will be purged out of mempool by all nodes on the network (no solid expiration time on this, but if it happens both traders will need to do an SPV resync to let Bisq acknowledge the deposit tx never took place)\n\n= What can be done to speed things up =\n\nA common strategy to accelerate a Bitcoin transaction is called Child Pays For Parent (CPFP), and consists of spending one of the outputs (child) of an unconfirmed transaction (parent) at a high fee, so those miners who want to collect said high fee, will necessarily have to confirm both child and parent transactions in the same block (and that's why child pays for parent).\n\nCalculating the fee you need to pay for the child, so the parent fee is bumped to the desired value, requires knowing the total size of all involved transactions, and absolute fees that are already on the table, but for practicality, let us say that if you want to double the effective fee rate of the parent, you need to use a fee that is 3 to 4 times more than the parent's original fee, and increasing this even more will further speed up the confirmation.\n\nCPFP can only be done by the owner of the unconfirmed UTXO that will act as a child, so when a deposit tx is stuck in mempool after Bisq wallet was funded at a low fee, these are the possible cases:\n* trader sent funds to Bisq wallet at low fee, but has a change output of this funding that went back to his external wallet: trader has to send this change output to another address of the same external wallet, using a very high fee\n* trader sent a whole UTXO to Bisq wallet, and used part of it to fund a deposit tx: he will have to do CPFP within Bisq, by going to ''Funds > Receive Funds'', copy the first unused receive address, then go to ''Funds > Send Funds'' and, after selecting the unconfirmed UTXO(s), send the full amount to the Bisq address taken from the clipboard, enabling ''Use custom value'' at the bottom to manually choose a very high fee\n\nThe trader who needs to do this is the one who used a low fee in the external wallet while funding Bisq.\n\nWhen the CPFP transaction is published, you will notice that the effective fee rate of the deposit tx was increased, and if you chose a high enough fee for the child transaction, it should be confirmed in the next few blocks.\n\n= Inapplicable cases =\n\nThe above strategy is only possible when there is a change output owned by one of the traders, that can be used to bump the parent's fee.\n\nWhen the trade was funded from internal Bisq funds, and the reserved balance had already confirmed, but the deposit didn't, because of a sudden and very high spike in mempool traffic, this strategy will not be possible, because there is no change output that can be spent in order to raise the effective fee rate.\n\n= Final considerations =\n\nIf you find yourself in one of the scenarios where you can apply the aforementioned strategy, remember you are responsible for your own funds, and expected to know what you are doing. It is unlikely to actually lose funds unless you send the UTXO to a wrong address, but you could waste the mining fees if you didn't choose a high enough fee for the CPFP, as then you would need to either RBF the CPFP (not covered in this article), or do an additional CPFP at a much higher cost.\n\n= External acceleration services =\n\n[https://mempool.space mempool.space] has now the option to accelerate transactions that are in mempool: open the transaction detail page, and right next to the ETA field you will find an ''Accelerate'' button that will give you access to a paid service which will increase the fee of the transaction by paying miners off-band.\n\n= Fee-bumping a DPT =\n\nSame considerations apply to delayed payout transactions needed to start arbitration, but in this case it is always possible to CPFP a DPT.", "category": "bisq1"}

Any penalties will be taken from the trader's BTC security deposit.\n\nThe trader at fault will be charged the penalty, and their security deposit will be deducted a BTC amount.\n\nThe trader that is wronged will receive the BTC penalty as compensation. The payout transaction for the trade will include funds from the other trader's security deposit.\n\nFor more information about what to expect, you can see the table of penalties.

Arbitration is only available when:\n* One or both traders reject a mediator's proposed solution.\n* The time-locked transaction (the delayed payout transaction created at the trade's start) is published by one of the traders.\n\nThis transaction sends **all** funds in the multisig escrow (both traders' funds) to the Burning Men.\n\nThe delayed payout transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed for altcoin trades, or 20 days for fiat trades.\n\nConsider this transaction as a safeguard or fallback option, to be used only when other options have failed.\n\nPractically, here's how arbitration works:\n\n# If you're trading with an unresponsive peer or feel the mediator's suggestion was unfair, publish the time-locked transaction as soon as possible and request arbitration.\n# Collaborate with the arbitrator to clarify your case's details.\n# If the arbitrator sides with you, they will personally reimburse you.\n# The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO for the reimbursements they've paid. This isn't something you need to worry about as a trader, but it's good to know how the process works on both sides.\n# Arbitrators are required to respond to messages within 5 days, so it may take a bit longer for them to respond than mediators (you should still respond to messages within 2 days).\n\n## = Burning Men Protocol\n=\nAll trades placed from 1st January 2023 will use a new trade protocol (Burning Men Protocol), designed to further improve Bisq's decentralization.

The protocol change means trades placed from 1st January 2023 will have an important difference should the trade end in arbitration.\n\nThis change is necessary for the security of the new protocol.\n\n**Remember, arbitration should be seen as a last resort. All efforts should be made for traders to come to an agreement with themselves or via the mediator.**\n\n## How to find your arbitrator ?\n\nYour arbitrator's name should be visible when you open a arbitration ticket.

Bisq isn't a black-box corporation with inscrutable processes. It's an open software project that is governed openly.\n\nTherefore, for whatever reason, if the process above doesn't work for you, you can make a make a reimbursement request yourself in the Bisq DAO.

{"title": "Face-to-face (payment method)", "content": "Bisq can help users arrange **face-to-face** (F2F) trades to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nDone correctly, this may be the only payment method that can be both private ''and'' anonymous. But there are a number of things you should consider when doing a F2F trade on Bisq.\n\nF2F trades are ''technically'' very similar to online trades. In fact, to carry out a F2F trade, you follow the exact same process within the Bisq software as you would for any other trade. The difference is in how the buyer pays the seller: instead of paying through a financial intermediary (like a bank or other money transfer service), the buyer meets the seller in real life and pays with cash.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Setting up a F2F account in Bisq =\n\nWhen setting up a F2F payment account in Bisq, you will be asked to enter the following information:\n\n* Country\n* Currency\n* City (this will be displayed with the offer)\n* Additional information (for example where you would like to complete the trade, **do NOT place direct contact information here!**)\n\nYou can only select one currency for a single F2F account. If you would like to trade with more than one currency, please create separate accounts for each currency.\n\nDefine any special terms, conditions, or details you would like to be displayed with your offers in the 'Additional Information' field. **Users can see this field ''before'' taking the offer by clicking the info icon of the offer.**\n\n= Making a F2F offer =\n\nMake sure to state any special terms or conditions in the 'Additional Information' field of the payment account before making an offer. The person taking the offer will be accepting these terms and conditions by taking the offer. For example you could include that you are looking to complete the trade in a Starbucks within the city center.\n\nPlease note it is against Bisq rules to use the 'Additional Information' field to include advertising offers with a way to contact you prior to the trade (e.g. website, phone, email, or Matrix/Keybase/Telegram user name). Doing this can result in a penalty, should someone take your offer and request for you to be penalized.\n\n= Taking a F2F offer =\n\n**Make sure to check the offer maker's terms and conditions before taking a F2F offer.** If you cannot fulfill the terms, do not take the the offer. If you have specific terms you would prefer, consider making your own offer instead.\n\n## Meeting your trading partner\n\nDoing a transaction face-to-face means you’ll be coming within close proximity of a stranger to exchange relatively substantial value.\n\n## = Be safe\n=\n\nPeople do local, in-person commerce all the time, all over the world. Incidents are rare, but they do happen. You should be cognizant of risks and do your part to minimize potential harm.\n\n**Guard your data.** When you set up a face-to-face payment account in Bisq, you’ll need to provide contact information so you can arrange a meeting with your trading partner. Make sure this information isn’t traceable back to your property or identity.\n\n**Meet in a neutral public place.** Meeting your trading partner in a place with witnesses and security cameras significantly reduces the chance of an incident.\n\n**Don’t bring more than you need.** Even in a public place, incidents can still happen, but you can limit the chance even further by limiting valuables on your person that would interest a thief in the first place.\n\n**Bring backup.** Consider bringing a friend with you. Also, depending on the laws in your area & your own comfort, consider carrying a concealed tool for self-defense. Even pepper-spray can hobble a criminal just enough to get you out of immediate danger.\n\n## = Validate payment\n=\n\nFace-to-face trades are usually settled with cash. Cash is wonderfully anonymous, but it can be counterfeited. Be sure you know the basics of detecting counterfeit currency. For example, there are several characteristics of US dollar bills one can examine to quickly determine fakes with high accuracy.\n\nYou could look for tools like counterfeit pens to do the work for you, but make sure you do thorough research before picking one. Counterfeit pens, for example, are often not reliable.\n\nIf you’d rather not take the chance of carrying or accepting cash, consider meeting at a bank where you can validate a buyer’s payment on the spot.\n\n## = Ensure you follow Bisq protocol\n=\n\nUltimately, the deal will be completed in Bisq. Buyers must mark payment as sent before sellers can release assets.\n\n**Buyers** should bring a laptop with them so they can mark the payment as sent. Otherwise, the buyer will end up paying the seller and have to walk away without the bitcoin they paid for (since the seller won’t be able to acknowledge receipt of payment before the buyer acknowledges they sent payment).\n\n**Sellers** should bring a laptop with their Bisq client running no matter what. Once they receive a legitimate payment, they’ll need to mark the payment as received so the assets are released to the buyer. No buyer will want to walk away after paying without proof of a complete deal.\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe lack of verifiable actions makes handling face-to-face disputes much harder.\n\nThis is why we highly recommend that both parties bring laptops and acknowledge their ends of the deal on the spot.\n\nOtherwise, the same dispute process is in place for F2F trades, but be advised that mediators and arbitrators often won’t have a way to settle disputes. In such cases, aggrieved traders can send deposit funds arbitration and make an appeal to the Bisq DAO.\n\nHaving said that, mediators and arbitrators may attempt different tactics to get a handle on the situation.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Failed Trades - Reimbursement of Trade Fees and Miner Fees", "content": "Sometimes trades on Bisq fail because of bugs or edge situations, that lead to an invalid deposit transaction: either no deposit txid exists, or the txid is missing from the blockchain (as can be verified on a blockchain explorer).\n\nUsually failed trades will also have an issue with the maker and/or taker txid, caused by an out-of-sync internal Bisq wallet on the party with the failed tx.\n* if miner and trade fees were lost for the BTC buyer and/or seller, a reimbursement can be considered if the lost fees are significant enough, e.g. above $10 of value\n* if no fees were lost, no reimbursement is obviously needed\n* **no other losses will be caused by a failed trade**, as the deposit tx never happens, so no additional funds will have left your wallet in the first place\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Common reasons for trades to fail\n\nThe most common reason for a trade to fail is either the maker or taker is trading with an out-of-sync bitcoin wallet.\n\nWhen the maker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet they will often be able to 'make' a trade of their choosing. Normally one of two things happen:\n# 1. When the maker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet most often the trade will end up not being displayed on the Bisq Markets for someone to take as the software checks to make sure an offer is valid before propagating it to the peer to peer network. When a trade fails in this way the maker will not have lost any trade fees or miner fees as there was never any maker transaction ID. In this instance the fix is for the maker of the trade to do an SPV resync. Once this is completed they can delete the trade they made by goin to Portfolio > Open Offers and pressing the delete icon next to the trade.\n# 2. Sometimes an invalid maker offer can be shown in a users Bisq instance. If this happens when the taker takes the offer they will lose both mining and trade fees as they will incur costs for the taker transaction ID even though a deposit transaction will not be created. In this case reimbursement can be considered by the taker if the lost fees are significant enough to warrant making a reimbursement request, eg above $10 of value.). In this instance the fix is for the maker of the trade to do an SPV resync.\n\nWhen the taker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet they will often be able to 'take' a trade of their choosing. Normally one of two things happen:\n# 1. The trade remains in the offer book, the taker transaction and the deposit transaction fails, the trade can be seen on both the buyer's and seller's Bisq instance. The deposit transaction confirmation will show as N/A. This is because the deposit transaction could not be created because the taker transaction failed. In this instance neither the maker or taker will have lost any trade or miner fees. The offer will still be able to be taken in the offer book, and the taker transaction did not confirm so no fees were spent from the takers wallet. In this instance the fix is for the taker of the trade to do an SPV resync.\n# 2. The trade is removed from the offer book, the taker transaction and the deposit transaction fails, the trade can be seen on both the buyer's and seller's Bisq instance. The deposit transaction confirmation will show as being present but a check on a blockchain explorer will show it as an invalid transaction. This is because the deposit transaction could not be created because the taker transaction failed. In this instance the maker will have lost trade and miner fees, but the taker will not have lost any fees. In this case reimbursement can be considered by the maker if the lost fees are significant enough to warrant making a reimbursement request, eg above $10 of value.). In this instance the fix is for the taker of the trade to do an SPV resync.\n\n## Less common reasons for trades to fail\n\nLess common reasons for trades to fail are:\n\n* Bugs in the software\n* Tor network issues\n* A user trading with an out of space hard drive, corrupted wallet, or poor connection to the Bisq network\n\nIn these cases the maker and taker can check their respective transaction IDs.\n\n* If the maker or taker ID failed then the respective user will not have lost any miner or trade fees.\n* If the maker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the maker will not have lost any trade or miner fees IF the deposit transaction shows as N/A\n* If the maker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the maker will have lost trade and mine fees IF the deposit transaction shows as being present but is invalid when checked on the blockchain.\n* If the taker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the taker will have lost trade and miner fees if the trade failed.\n\nIn instances like the above ideally the trade would end up in mediation and the mediator will request your logs to understand what the issue was that caused the trade to fail and make recommendations for what, if anything, you need to do to avoid future instances of failed trades.\n\n## What failed trades are eligible for reimbursement?\n\nAny user that has lost trade and miner fees is eligible for reimbursement.\n\nTrades are also only eligible for reimbursement if submitted within 3 months from the date of the trade.\n\n## When to consider reimbursement?\n\nIt is important to remember no trade or deposit funds are lost with failed trades. Most of the time if you see your Bisq wallet is missing funds from a failed trade it means your wallet it out-of-sync, which is why the trade failed! Do an SPV resync to fix the issue and your wallet will show the correct balance.\n\nReimbursement of a filed trade requires some work to do in gathering the information and posting it online, it also have some privacy implications as you are having to post maker, taker, and deposit transaction IDs. As a result of this it is often not making reimbursement requests for MOST failed trades as miner and trade fees are usually small (less than a few dollars, local currency equivalent, of value). Therefore, it is recommended traders ONLY request reimbursement for trades where they feel their trade fee and miner fee losses are significant enough to warrant the time to do so. Most of the time this will be for takers with lost trade fees where the trade that failed was a large amount of BTC. For example the maximum trade fee loss on a 1 BTC trade would be 0.0044 BTC. This would be worth requesting reimbursement for.\n\n## What should I do before requesting reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees?\n\nBefore requesting reimbursement for a filed trade you should make sure you are eligible for reimbursement ie you have lost both trade fees and miner fees.\n\nYou should also be aware of what miner fees and reimbursement fees you have lost on the trade. This is important as it means traders are aware of what fees they are claiming before they make a reimbursement request and prevents any misunderstanding of users with failed trades assuming they have lost the trade or deposit amounts when that is not the case, and in most cases can be quickly solved with an SPV Resync.\n\n##\nHow do I know what my miner fees were?\n##\n\nPlease also make sure you know how much miner fees you lost for a trade. This can be checked on blockchain explorer.\n\nthumb|center|This shows where you can find your miner fees on a blockchain explorer such as mempool.space\n\n##\nHow do I know what my trader fees were?\n##\n\nPlease also make sure you know how much trade fees you lost for a trade. This will be a percentage of the trade amount and differs depending on whether you were the maker or taker or chose BTC or BSQ to pay the trade fees.\n\n* BTC trade fees are 0.15% of the trade amount for the maker and 1.15% of the trade amount for the taker.\n* BSQ trade fees are 0.075% of the trade amount for the maker and 0.575% of the trade amount for the taker.\n\nYou can check the latest trading fees here.\n\nYou can verify your BTC fees on any blockchain explorer.\n\nYou can verify your BSQ fees on a BSQ explorer such as https://bisq.markets/ or https://bisq.mempool.emzy.de/\n\n## How to make reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees from a failed trade?\n\nYou can make a reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees from a failed trade by creating a new issue on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues Bisq GitHub Support repository].\n\nYou will need a GitHub account, to maintain privacy feel free to create on just for the purpose of the reimbursement. There is a [https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=reimbursement-template.md&title=Fee+reimbursement+for+trade+XXXXX template here]* that you should follow to create your reimbursement request.\n\n*This link will only work when you are logged into a GitHub account.\n\nOnce your issue is posted a support agent might ask you some more questions if they need any extra info to what you have provided.\n\nIf your request is a valid one for reimbursement then the [https://bisq.wiki/Fee_Reimbursement_Agent Fee Reimbursement Agent] will add you to their list of reimbursement cases to payout.

{"title": "Frequently asked questions", "content": "Below is a compilation of **frequently-asked questions (FAQ)** about Bisq, how to use it, and how to help the project.\n\nFeel free to ask further questions on any of Bisq's many outreach channels linked at the bottom of this page.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## About\n\n##\nHow is Bisq different from other decentralized exchanges?\n##\n\nBisq is fundamentally different: it's a peer-to-peer trading network accessed via software you run on your own hardware, not a website or centralized service. It connects you directly to other users running the software to facilitate trades. It's open-source and community-driven via a DAO.\n\nCrucially, you can trade bitcoin directly for fiat currencies (like USD, EUR) or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThink of it like owning your home versus renting. With Bisq, you have full control over your funds and data; with centralized services (even DEX websites), you're subject to the platform's rules and risks.\n\nWith Bisq you're always the owner:\n\n* Bisq does **not** hold your bitcoin. Trading funds (in the classic v1 protocol) are held in **2-of-2 multisignature addresses** controlled solely by you and your trading peer.\n* Bisq does **not** hold your national currency. Fiat transfers happen directly between traders using external payment services.\n* All data travels over Bisq's secure peer-to-peer network built on Tor—no central servers means **no data honeypots** vulnerable to large-scale hacks.\n* Bisq requires **no registration or KYC**, protecting your privacy. Data about who trades with whom is not stored.\n* Bisq is code, not a company, governed by its DAO.\n\nSee more in the Introduction.\n\n##\nIs Bisq open-source software?\n##\n\nYes. Bisq's software is free/libre open-source licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3).\n\nYou can find the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq source code] and [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/LICENSE license] on GitHub.\n\n##\nIs Bisq safe?\n##\n\nBisq is designed with multiple layers of security, and strong incentives encourage fair trading, making the vast majority of trades proceed smoothly.\n\nKey security mechanisms (particularly in the classic v1 protocol) include:\n\n* Bitcoin secured in a 2-of-2 multisignature escrow address controlled only by the traders.\n* Mandatory security deposits from both traders, refunded upon successful completion, deterring fraud.\n* A 3-tier dispute resolution system (trader chat, mediation, arbitration) for handling issues.\n\nHowever, trading fiat currencies always carries some inherent **chargeback risk**, as banks can sometimes reverse payments. Bisq mitigates this by:\n\n* Supporting mainly payment methods known to have lower chargeback risk (explicitly avoiding easily reversed methods like PayPal or credit cards).\n* Employing an account signing mechanism in v1 for certain fiat methods, which limits trade sizes for new accounts until integrity is established through successful trades.\n\nNewer protocols like Bisq Easy use different security models, such as relying on seller reputation instead of security deposits.\n\n## Getting started\n\n##\nI find Bisq very confusing initially!\n##\n\nYou're not alone; some users find the interface takes getting used to, especially compared to simpler centralized exchanges.\n\n* Check out the official [https://bisq.network/getting-started/ getting-started guide].\n* Visual guides and tutorials may be available on the [https://bisq.network/ Bisk Network website] or community channels. (Note: Previous specific video links were outdated/broken).\n\nBisq is under continuous development, with ongoing efforts to improve the user interface and experience.\n\n##\nMy currency market has few or no offers. What can I do?\n##\n\nMarket liquidity varies. Some markets are very active, while others are less so, often due to the availability of suitable local payment methods or lack of initial bootstrapping.\n\nYou can check recent activity for your market via `Market` > `Trades` in the application.\n\nTo help grow a market:\n* Ensure suitable local Payment methods are supported. You can [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new/choose suggest new ones here].\n* Spread the word in relevant local communities to attract both buyers/sellers and market makers. Bisq contributors can often offer support and resources for local outreach efforts.\n\n##\nDo I really need bitcoin to buy bitcoin on Bisq? How do I get started with none?\n##\n\nYes, the classic Bisq v1 trading protocol requires a small amount of BTC for security deposits and mining fees, creating a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem for complete beginners.\n\nHere are ways to get your first small amount of BTC:\n* See suggestions on the Funding your wallet page (e.g., friends, Bitcoin ATMs, earning BTC).\n* Visit the `Get your first BTC` room on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] to potentially arrange small, informal trades (details here).\n* Use the **Bisq Easy** trading protocol available in Bisq 2, which does **not** require a security deposit, making it ideal for first-time buyers.\n\n## Trading (Classic v1 Protocol)\n\n##\nWhat are trading fees?\n##\n\nTrading fees are a percentage of the trade size. If paid in BTC, makers pay 0.1% and takers pay 0.7%. Fees are roughly halved if paid in BSQ tokens. Remember you also need BTC for on-chain mining fees (for deposit and payout transactions) and the security deposit itself (which is returned if the trade completes successfully).\n\n##\nMining fees are high. How can I trade cost-effectively?\n##\n\nThe classic protocol requires 4 on-chain transactions (3 paid by taker, 1 by maker). To minimize costs:\n* Be an offer **maker** rather than a taker (fewer transactions to pay for).\n* Trade when network **mining fees are lower**.\n* Make offers for **larger BTC amounts** (fees are fixed per transaction, less impactful on larger trades).\n* **Pay trading fees with BSQ** for an approximate 50% discount.\n\n##\nWhy require a security deposit in BTC?\n##\n\nSecurity deposits incentivize both parties to follow the Trading rules. They are locked in multisig escrow with the trade amount and returned upon successful completion. If rules are broken, the deposit can be partially or fully awarded to the counterparty via dispute resolution, deterring violations like non-payment or failing to confirm payment.\n\n##\nWhat are trading limits? How much can I trade at once?\n##\n\nMaximum BTC per trade varies by payment method based on perceived risk (especially chargeback risk). For example, methods like Zelle or SEPA often have lower limits (e.g., 0.0625 BTC) than less reversible methods. Altcoin trades generally have higher limits (e.g., 0.5 BTC in v1) as chargebacks aren't possible. Check the Payment methods page for current limits per method. Also see Account_limits regarding initial limits for new accounts.\n\n##\nWhich payment methods are available?\n##\n\nSee the Payment methods page for the full list. You can [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new/choose suggest new payment methods] via GitHub.\n\n##\nHow does Bisq handle fiat (USD, EUR, etc.)?\n##\n\nBisq **never** touches or holds fiat currency. Fiat payments are transferred directly between the buyer and seller using their agreed-upon external payment service (e.g., bank transfer, Zelle). Bisq's role is to provide the secure environment (escrow, deposits) and process for peers to coordinate this external transfer safely.\n\n##\nHow long does a trade take?\n##\n\nTrade times vary greatly depending on the chosen payment method and trader responsiveness.\n* Bisq requires the initial deposit transaction to confirm (usually ~10 minutes) before the buyer can send payment.\n* Some Payment methods are near-instant (SEPA Instant, Faster Payments), allowing trades to complete quickly after the deposit confirms.\n* Others take days (SEPA, Wire Transfers, ACH).\n* Altcoin trades are typically faster (1 day or 1 hour for Instant).\nCheck the Payment methods page for the maximum trading period allowed for each method. Manual confirmation by both parties is always required.\n\n##\nHow does Bisq protect my privacy?\n##\n\n* Bisq is standalone software, not a website logging your activity.\n* Payment information is stored locally and only shared with your direct trading peer (and potentially dispute resolution agents if needed).\n* All P2P network communication uses Tor for IP address anonymization.\n* All data exchanged between users is end-to-end encrypted.\n* No registration or KYC is required.\n\n##\nDo I need to keep Bisq online for my offers?\n##\n\nYes. Since there are no central servers, your Bisq application must be running and online for your offers to be visible and available for others to take. If Bisq goes offline, your offers are removed from the distributed offer book but are automatically republished the next time you start Bisq. Once a trade *starts*, continuous connection isn't required, but you must come online periodically to perform necessary actions (send payment, confirm receipt).\n\n##\nDo I have to use the built-in Bisq wallet?\n##\n\nNo. While convenient for holding trading funds (BTC, BSQ) and security deposits, you can choose to send funds *from* or receive funds *to* an external wallet address when initiating or completing trades.\n\n##\nDo I have to use the BSQ token?\n##\n\nNo, using BSQ is optional. You can pay Trading fees in BTC. However, using BSQ provides a significant discount (around 50%) on trading fees and directly supports Bisq contributors through the DAO mechanism.\n\n##\nWill my bank know I'm trading bitcoin?\n##\n\nBisq itself doesn't interact with your bank. However, your trading peer will see your name associated with the payment. Some banks have been known to flag accounts involved in peer-to-peer crypto trading. To minimize potential issues:\n* **Never** put Bitcoin-related terms (\"BTC\", \"Bisq\", etc.) in payment references/memos.\n* Leave the reference field **blank** if possible.\n* If a reference is required, use something neutral and innocuous, or just your name. Agree with your peer via trader chat if unsure.\nSee Trading rules for details.\n\n## Common Technical Niggles\n\n## = Startup / Connection Issues\n=\n\n##\nBisq on macOS won't open, or asks for keystroke recording permission!\n##\n\n* If it won't open, try right-clicking the app icon and selecting `Open`.\n* The keystroke permission prompt is a known issue related to older Java versions sometimes bundled; Bisq does **not** record keystrokes. See [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373 GitHub issue 3373] for historical context. Ensure you are using a recent Bisq version.\n\n##\nBisq seems slow or uses high CPU/memory on startup.\n##\n\nThis is often caused by Bisq synchronizing blockchain data (SPV sync). While newer releases include recent data to speed this up, it can still take time, especially if you haven't run Bisq recently. Let it finish syncing; performance should normalize afterwards. If issues persist on a current version, check Reducing_memory_usage or seek support.\n\n##\nOn Linux with a high-resolution display, everything is tiny!\n##\n\nSee Running_on_HiDPI_screen for solutions.\n\n##\n\"Payment started\" button won't stick / asks to send confirmation again.\n##\n\nThis is a known issue related to P2P network conditions, often when the peer is offline. Try these steps:\n* Send a message in trader chat.\n* Click the \"Payment started\" button multiple times.\n* Restart Bisq.\n* Try `Settings` > `Network Info` > `Open Tor Settings` > `Delete Outdated Tor Files And Shutdown`, then restart Bisq.\n* Wait while staying online (it sometimes resolves itself).\n* If the trade period is ending, open mediation (`Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O` on the trade) and explain the issue to the Mediator, potentially providing screenshots.\n\n## = Wallet / Sync Issues\n=\n\n##\n\"Offer cannot be taken due to counterparty trade restrictions\". What does this mean?\n##\n\nThis usually means information about the offer maker's account limits (based on age/signing status) hasn't fully propagated across the P2P network to your Bisq instance yet. Try restarting Bisq. The offer maker might also need to restart their Bisq client.\n\n##\nMy SPV resync is taking forever or freezing!\n##\n\nThis can happen with older wallets or wallets with many transactions.\n* If it stalls, close and restart Bisq to resume the sync.\n* Syncing is much faster if you connect Bisq to your own local Bitcoin full node.\n* After a very long resync completes, consider switching to a fresh wallet to prevent future issues.\n\n##\nHow can I get a fresh Bisq wallet and transfer my BSQ balance to it?\n##\n\nThis involves carefully renaming directories while Bisq is **closed**. The wallet is in `btc_mainnet/wallet` inside your Data_directory.\n1. Ensure you have some BTC in your current wallet for transaction fees.\n2. Close Bisq. Rename the `wallet` directory to `oldWallet`.\n3. Start Bisq. It will create a new, empty `wallet` directory. Immediately go to `Account` > `Wallet Seed`, write down the new seed phrase securely offline, and note down your new BTC and BSQ receiving addresses.\n4. Close Bisq. Rename the new `wallet` directory to `newWallet`. Rename `oldWallet` back to `wallet`.\n5. Start Bisq (loading your original wallet). Send your BSQ and BTC funds to the new receiving addresses you saved in step 3.\n6. Close Bisq. Rename `wallet` to `oldWallet` (or delete it if funds are confirmed sent and old seed backed up). Rename `newWallet` to `wallet`.\n7. Start Bisq. You should see your funds in the fresh wallet.\n\n## = DAO Sync Issues\n=\n\n##\n\"heightOfLastBlock must match chainHeight\" error on startup\n##\n\nThis indicates a DAO state mismatch. Try this fix:\n1. Make a backup of your data directory.\n2. Close Bisq.\n3. Navigate to your Data_directory. Delete the `DaoStateStore` directory and the `BsqBlocks` directory (usually found within `btc_mainnet/db/`).\n4. Restart Bisq. It will resync the DAO state.\n\n##\n\"Cannot take offer because snapshot height does not match...\" error\n##\n\nThis means your local DAO state is out of sync with your peer.\n1. Try going to `Settings` > `Preferences` and click \"Rebuild DAO state from resources\".\n2. Restart Bisq when prompted. Let the DAO sync fully (watch for \"Synchronizing DAO\" message at the bottom to disappear).\n3. Try taking the offer again. If the error persists, the other trader likely needs to resync their DAO state.\n\n## = Installation / Environment Issues\n=\n\n##\nI want to install Bisq on a VPS or headless system.\n##\n\nBisq requires a graphical desktop environment. Some users report success using tools like [https://www.xpra.org Xpra] to forward the GUI, but this is an advanced setup and not officially supported.\n\n##\nI receive a `Java heap space` error on Linux.\n##\n\nYou may need to increase the memory allocated to Bisq. Edit the launch configuration file (often `/opt/bisq/lib/app/Bisq.cfg` or similar) and increase the value in `java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=Xg` (e.g., change `8g` to `16g` if you have sufficient RAM).\n\n## Dispute resolution\n\n##\nHow does dispute resolution work?\n##\n\nBisq uses a 3-layer system: Trader chat, Mediation, and Arbitration. Most issues can be resolved directly via chat. If not, a Mediator can be called (Ctrl+O / Cmd+O on the trade) to propose a resolution based on Trading rules. Arbitration is a rare final step if mediation fails. (Note: The arbitrator role changed significantly in v1.2). See Dispute_Resolution_in_Bisq_1 for full details.\n\n##\nHow is collusion between mediators, arbitrators, and traders prevented?\n##\n\nSince Bisq v1.2, trade funds are held in 2-of-2 multisig addresses controlled *only* by the two traders. Mediators and arbitrators do *not* hold a key and cannot unilaterally release funds, preventing collusion risk involving escrow control. They are still bonded roles within the DAO to ensure they act fairly and responsibly when investigating and proposing resolutions.\n\n##\nWhat happens if the buyer does a chargeback after BTC is released?\n##\n\nBisq cannot reverse fiat chargebacks made through external banking systems. If a chargeback occurs after the trade is complete and BTC is released, the seller generally has no recourse *within Bisq*. This risk is why Bisq avoids easily reversible payment methods and uses account aging and account signing (in v1) to vet traders using riskier methods. Payment methods frequently used for chargebacks may be removed from Bisq.\n\n##\nWouldn't a pure reputation system be better than dispute resolution?\n##\n\nPure reputation systems are vulnerable to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack Sybil attacks] (creating fake identities) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick long con] attacks. They can also compromise privacy (tying reputation to identity) and decentralization (requiring central storage). Bisq's model combines protocol incentives (like security deposits in v1 or Reputation in Bisq Easy) with human-based dispute resolution for robustness.\n\n##\nHow can I contact my trading peer?\n##\n\nUse the built-in, end-to-end encrypted trader chat available within the trade screen in the Bisq application. Avoid external communication methods.\n\n## DAO\n\n##\nWhat is the Bisq DAO?\n##\n\nThe Bisq DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is how the Bisq project governs itself and funds its development without relying on a traditional company structure. It's built on Bitcoin and ensures the project remains decentralized and censorship-resistant, aligning governance with the software's principles. Read the Introduction_to_the_DAO.\n\n##\nHow does the Bisq DAO work?\n##\n\nIt primarily handles funding and strategy:\n1. **Funding:** Trading fees paid by users (especially when paid in BSQ, Bisq's native token) are distributed to contributors whose work is approved by DAO voting.\n2. **Strategy:** Project direction, parameter changes, and other decisions are made collectively through proposals and voting by BSQ stakeholders within the Bisq application.\nLearn more in the DAO documentation. (Note: Previous specific video links were outdated/broken).\n\n##\nWhat do I need to know about the DAO as a trader?\n##\n\nParticipation is **optional**. You don't need BSQ or DAO interaction to trade. However, using BSQ to pay Trading fees gives you a significant discount (~50%) and directly funds project contributors. When you buy BSQ, you typically buy it from a contributor; when you pay fees with BSQ, it's 'burned' (destroyed). See more on this cycle here.\n\n##\nIs BSQ just for fundraising? What's its issuance?\n##\n\nNo, the DAO/BSQ system is primarily for decentralized **distribution** of existing trading fee revenue to contributors, not for initial fundraising. BSQ is 'issued' (created by coloring bitcoin) only when a contributor's compensation request is approved by DAO vote. It's 'destroyed' when used for fees. There's no pre-mine or fixed issuance schedule like many other tokens.\n\n##\nCan I use Bisq without BSQ and the DAO?\n##\n\nYou can pay Trading fees with BTC instead of BSQ. However, since Bisq version 1.9.8, the DAO components are always active in the background as they are integral to how contributor roles and network parameters are managed. Using the DAO/BSQ provides benefits (lower fees) and supports the project's decentralized funding model, which avoids reliance on centralized wallets. Learn more about the DAO here.

BTC buyers can buy a maximum of 0.007 BTC in one transaction. BTC sellers can sell a maximum of 0.007 BTC in one transaction.\n* Traders can negotiate their prices. Sellers of BTC will likely charge a high premium to cover mining fees, time, and profit.\n* BTC buyers should post on the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room the amount they are looking to buy, the payment method they are looking to use, and which currency they wish to make payment in: for example, \"I am looking to buy 0.007 BTC with GBP using Revolut.

This will reduce your losses if a trader disappears after payment, but should be weighed against transaction fees. If you are trading fiat, also consider the risk of a bank finding multiple transactions more suspicious than a single large purchase.\n\nIf a trader isn't comfortable with multiple installments, it's most likely out of their control, and you may want to find another trader or an alternative payment method. As always, you are doing this at your own risk; make sure to consider someone's track record to determine how cautious you should be. A trader that has consistently delivered positive results is more trustworthy than someone who hasn't completed any trades yet.\n\nIf a trader has treated you well, leaving a positive review in chat will help others with their own evaluation of that trader; likewise, if you have a bad experience with a trader, don't be afraid to leave a negative review, even if there is a possibility that it could've been accidental.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Bisq is a decentralized bitcoin exchange network best understood through its major components:\n\n# Bisq is primarily a cross-platform **desktop application** (currently Bisq 2) that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies, supporting multiple trading protocols.\n# Bisq provides **trading protocols** (like the classic v1 protocol and Bisq Easy) that enable individuals to exchange directly with one another over the internet, eliminating the need for trusted third-party exchange services.\n# Bisq operates on a **peer-to-peer network** formed by Bisq applications discovering, connecting to, and working with one another. The Bisq network is fully peer-to-peer, requires no centrally-controlled servers, and has no single points of failure.\n\nBisq is not a company—it is **free/libre software** released under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3). Bisq is built by individuals around the world who choose to work together, organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It is used by individuals globally who prefer trading directly with peers instead of using centralized bitcoin exchanges.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Why Bisq exists\n\nBisq’s mission is to provide a **secure**, **private**, and **censorship-resistant** way of exchanging bitcoin for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies over the internet.\n\n* When we say **secure**, we are referring to the safety of users' funds. Centralized exchanges often require users to deposit funds onto exchange servers, creating large targets for hackers and thieves. Bisq avoids this custodial risk.\n* When we say **private**, we are referring to users' ability to control their own information. Most centralized exchanges require extensive personal identification (KYC) to open an account, linking trading activity to real-world identities and creating risks of data leaks or misuse. Bisq requires no registration or KYC.\n* When we say **censorship-resistant**, we are referring to the freedom to trade voluntarily without third-party interference. Centralized exchanges operate within specific legal jurisdictions and can be shut down or forced to comply with regulations that restrict trading or mandate surveillance. Bisq's decentralized nature resists such external control.\n\nBisq was built to fulfill this mission: providing an exchange mechanism where users keep control of their funds, privacy is the default, and the freedom to transact is defended.\n\n## How Bisq works\n\n## = In a nutshell (v1 Trade Example)\n=\n\nImagine you want to buy bitcoin (BTC) in exchange for Euros (EUR). Using Bisq's classic v1 trading protocol (which involves security deposits), you are a ''buyer'' of BTC looking for a ''seller'' of BTC who accepts EUR.\n\nThe basic steps would be:\n\n# You download, install, and run the Bisq 2 desktop application.\n# You add your EUR payment method details (e.g., SEPA bank account) to your Bisq client.\n# You browse Bisq’s offer book for existing offers to sell BTC for EUR.\n# You take an existing offer, agreeing to the seller's price and terms. This initiates the trade process, including locking BTC from both parties into escrow.\n# You send the EUR payment using your chosen method (outside of Bisq) and confirm \"Payment sent\" in the Bisq application.\n# You and the seller wait for the EUR payment to arrive in the seller's account.\n# The seller receives the EUR payment and confirms receipt in Bisq.\n# The trade completes, and the bitcoin (trade amount + your security deposit) is released to your Bisq wallet. The seller also receives their security deposit back.\n\nFor complete setup instructions, see the [https://bisq.network/getting-started/ Getting Started] guide.\n\nThe exact steps can vary depending on whether you buy or sell, act as the offer maker or taker, and the specific payment methods involved. Regardless of the protocol, the process differs significantly from centralized exchanges.\n\n## = How trading with Bisq is different\n=\n\nKey characteristics distinguish Bisq trading:\n\n* **Desktop Application:** Bisq runs locally on your computer, not in a web browser.\n* **Manual Offer Taking:** There is no automatic order matching. Users manually browse the offer book and choose specific offers from peers. This enables direct P2P settlement and user control over counterparties.\n* **Out-of-Band Fiat Payments:** Bisq orchestrates, but does not directly process, fiat (or altcoin) payments. These transfers happen directly between users via their chosen payment methods outside the Bisq application itself.\n\nThese differences lead to a fundamental trade-off: Bisq trades may take longer to settle than on centralized platforms, but they offer significantly enhanced security, privacy, and censorship resistance.\n\n## = How Bisq keeps funds secure\n=\nMechanisms vary by protocol, but core principles include:\n* **Non-Custodial:** Users always retain control of their fiat and cryptocurrency funds. Bisq never holds user funds.\n* **Incentives/Collateral:** Trading protocols use mechanisms to ensure fair play. The classic v1 protocol uses security deposits locked from both buyer and seller alongside the trade amount in a **2-of-2 multisig escrow**. Other protocols like Bisq Easy rely on seller reputation.\n* **Dispute Resolution:** If issues arise, a decentralized human dispute resolution system (including trader chat, mediation, and potentially arbitration) is available.\n\n## = How Bisq keeps data private\n=\n* **No Registration/KYC:** Using Bisq requires no identity verification or account registration with a central entity.\n* **Tor Network:** All peer-to-peer network communication runs over the Tor network by default, masking IP addresses.\n* **No Central Servers:** Bisq has no central databases storing user or trade data.\n* **Encrypted Communication:** Trade details are end-to-end encrypted between the trading counterparties.\n\n## = How Bisq resists censorship\n=\n* **Distributed P2P Network:** The network consists of users running the software globally, making it difficult for any single entity to shut down.\n* **Built on Tor:** Inherits Tor's own censorship resistance properties.\n* **Code, Not a Company:** Bisq is open-source software developed by a DAO, not a legal corporate entity that can be easily targeted or shut down by regulators.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Introduction to the DAO", "content": "The Bisq network is governed by a **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** built on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## = What is a DAO?\n=\n\nConventional entities such as for-profit and non-profit corporations must be sanctioned by the state: they are legal entities registered in particular jurisdictions. No matter how big or small or virtuous or innovative they are, they cannot operate without state approval. In return for this approval, the entity is endowed with rights (e.g., limited liability) and responsibilities (e.g., taxes).\n\nA **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** is just a generic term for a governance model sanctioned by software: code defines conventions for governing the project irrespective of the stance of the state.\n\nThe universe of DAOs is diverse. Just as companies come in many shapes and sizes, and some companies are scammy, fraudulent, or just poorly managed—that’s no reason to assume all companies are the same way. It’s the same with DAOs: some DAOs haven’t worked out so well, but others might turn out differently.\n\n## The Bisq DAO\n\nThe Bisq DAO forgoes a system where governance is dictated by the rigid rules of software in favor of a self-contained economy where governance is guided by software but ultimately determined by the collective, subjective judgments of its community.\n\nIt achieves this by introducing a unit of value called the **BSQ token** that enables Bisq stakeholders—contributors, traders, or anyone who owns BSQ—to make subjective value judgments. This token underlies all actions in the DAO.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvOZlIDYEQ&feature=emb_logo Click here for a quick introductory video on the what & why of the Bisq DAO]\n\n## = BSQ token\n=\n\n## = Overview\n=\n\nHere’s a graphical overview of how the DAO works at a high level:\n\n700px|thumb|left\n\nLet’s observe some of the dynamics of this system:\n\n* Contributors ''maintain'' Bisq through valuable work\n* Traders ''use'' Bisq to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n* Contributors ''earn'' BSQ tokens when their compensation requests are approved through voting\n* Traders ''buy'' BSQ tokens in order to pay lower trading fees\n* Stakeholders ''vote'' on compensation requests\n* Contributors can ''lock'' a bond in BSQ to ensure integrity in high-trust roles\n\nNow let’s see how these dynamics enable the Bisq DAO to provide 3 core governance functions without any central points of authority.\n\n## = Earn and distribute revenue\n=\n\nEvery project needs to be financially sustainable to fund ongoing operations and development. But traditional means of handling revenue and revenue distribution are necessarily centralized—any receiving address or account must be owned by one person, or a small group; determining how much a person should be paid must be determined by one person, or a small group; etc.\n\n**Contributors produce, creating BSQ**\n\nIn the Bisq DAO, trading fees are collected from traders and distributed to contributors, but there is no central authority to do this. Here’s how it works: after a Bisq contributor does work, they file a **compensation request** in the DAO with a description of what they did and how much BSQ they want in return. Then, stakeholders (who are other contributors, traders, and anyone else with BSQ) vote for/against the request. If the request is approved, the contributor is issued new BSQ in the amount they requested and **BSQ supply is increased**.\n\n**Traders consume, burning BSQ**\n\nThen, a trader looking for lower trading fees can buy those BSQ tokens from a contributor. When they buy BSQ tokens for BTC, the contributor is paid for their work, and the value transfer from producer to consumer is complete! When a trader pays trading fees with BSQ, those BSQ tokens are burned or \"decolored\" and **BSQ supply is decreased**. This process of creating and destroying BSQ tokens enables a sort of [https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html#how-bsq-decentralizes-compensation-and-enables-monetary-policy monetary policy] controlled by Bisq stakeholders and traders.\n\nIn this way, there is no need for a central entity to collect and distribute revenue: the BSQ token enables a transfer of value from producer to consumer without any single entity controlling any aspect of the decision-making or distribution process.\n\nIn this way, the risk that people in high-trust roles misbehave is minimized, and the community has access to a responsible mechanism for handling such a scenario in cases that warrant it.\n\n## Learn more\n\nFor more information on how you can use the DAO to trade/contributor, how it works, its technical foundations, etc. please see the this page.", "category": "bisq1"}

For this to go well, you won't want your compensation request to be the first interaction you have with other Bisq contributors.\n\nIdeally, you will have already had conversations with team leads and other contributors to:\n* make them aware of what you want to do\n* get others' feedback on your plans\n* get an idea of how valuable your contribution is to the project(so your compensation request is reasonable to you ''and'' to stakeholders)\n** don't hesitate to suggest a ballpark cost before getting started, if one is not already suggested by other contributors; this helps avoid surprises and hurt feelings at compensation request time\n\nIt would be even better to have public threads (issues, pull requests, other discussion threads) tracking your work, progress, and outcomes to help stakeholders put your compensation request into perspective.

Work that’s planned or in-progress is not eligible for compensation.\n\nGenerally, work merged to the master branch of a repository can be considered delivered (if applicable).\n\nReporting bugs and/or opening issues generally does not qualify as delivered work since, strictly speaking, opening an issue does not usually ''deliver'' anything. With that said, there are occasional exceptions to this, so as suggested above, please keep other contributors informed about what you're up to in order to minimize misunderstandings.\n\n## Create your compensation request\n\nMaking a compensation request requires 2 steps:\n# opening an issue on GitHub\n# submitting the compensation request to the Bisq DAO\n\nIssuance and voting takes place on Bisq, but metadata (e.g. compensation request details) is stored on GitHub to decrease the data storage burden on the Bisq and Bitcoin networks.\n\nIf you wish to request compensation for the current cycle, please make a compensation request issue no later than one week prior to the end of the current cycle's proposal phase.

This is because a bot is used to parse requests to automatically aggregate work done for reporting and budgeting.\n\nThe placeholder text of the issue you just opened tells you everything you need to know.\n* In the \"Summary\" section, fill out all the numbers in brackets (**required**)\n* In the \"Contributions Delivered\" section, list your contributions as rows in the table (**required**)\n* In the \"Contributions in Progress\" section, list contributions you're expecting to deliver in future cycles\n\n##\nTips on making a convincing request\n##\n\nThe onus is on **you** to convince Bisq stakeholders what you did, how much it’s worth, and why it’s valuable. Voters will be evaluating what you put in this GitHub issue to determine whether or not you should be issued the BSQ you're asking for.\n\nIn order to make your case as strong as possible, make sure to:\n* Include as many links to issues, pull requests, and other \"evidence\" for any work you want to be compensated for\n* Comments that help explain what the work is, why it is valuable, etc.\n* Links to role reports, if you hold any roles in the Bisq network\n\nAs mentioned above, this is a big reason that it’s important that everything you do for Bisq be as public, documented, and verifiable as possible, and that everything you do has positive consensus with multiple stakeholders so you know you’re not wasting your time.\n\nEven then, not all stakeholders will be familiar with your work, so it’s important to be as thorough as you can when making a compensation request so there’s enough context for those unfamiliar with your work to make an informed vote.\n\nFeel free to check out [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed old compensation requests] if you're unsure about anything.\n\n##\nTips on valuing your work\n##\n\nValuing work is a judgment call. There's no precise way to go about valuing your work, but here are some pointers:\n* work should be valued based on the value of the contribution you made, not on the raw time you spent on it\n* if you are unsure about the value of your contribution, consider what you would charge for your work if you did it as a freelancer\n\nIdeally, especially if you're a new contributor, consider discussing compensation for particular tasks you're working on with another contributor who's been around longer to see if your expectations align with theirs. You can also browse older requests for examples of what people in the past were paid for similar work.\n\n## 3. Submit your GitHub issue and address feedback\n\nUpon submitting your compensation request issue (or removing [WIP] from the title), a bot will parse it to evaluate formatting. If it's not valid, the bot will add a parsed:invalid label to the issue and leave a comment with a reason. Please edit your issue until the bot adds a parsed:valid label. If the bot does not work and it does not produce any label, continue normally.\n\nYou may receive feedback from other contributors that needs to be addressed. After waiting for a prudential time, you can submit your request to the Bisq DAO.\n\n## 4. Submit your request as a DAO proposal\n\nOnce a team lead has given you the go-ahead, it's time to submit your request to the DAO.\n\nIn Bisq, go to DAO > Governance > Make Proposal.\n\n600px|thumb|left|Submitting a compensation request to the DAO.\n\n# Select \"Compensation request\" in the dropdown menu\n# Specify your GitHub handle, exactly like it is on GitHub\n# Replace the # with the number of your GitHub issue (for example, if your compensation request’s GitHub URL is https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/999, the URL in your DAO compensation request should be https://bisq.network/dao-compensation/999. Don’t copy the GitHub link directly—it won’t work!)\n# Specify the amount of BSQ you're requesting\n\nWhen you’re ready, click Make proposal to confirm your proposal for voting in the current cycle. **Proposal data cannot be edited, so make sure everything is correct.**\n\n## 5. Add a comment to your GitHub compensation request with your BSQ transaction ID\n\nTo ensure that someone else is not claiming for your contributions we ask that you post your BSQ transaction ID as a comment on the GitHub issue.\n\nYou can access your BSQ transaction ID for the compensation request in the Bisq application by visiting DAO > BSQ Wallet > Transactions\n\nPlease copy your transaction ID and paste it as comment on your GitHub issue thus linking Bisq compensation request with the GitHub issue.\n\n## = Fees and other costs\n=\n\nA compensation request is a type of proposal, and proposals cost a fee to make in the Bisq DAO. Currently that fee is 2 BSQ. Since a compensation request is intended to issue new BSQ, you’ll also need to include a small amount of bitcoin to be colored into BSQ if your proposal is accepted—100 satoshis × [requested BSQ amount]. See more details in the User Reference.\n\nAlso remember that Bisq DAO proposals are Bitcoin transactions, so it costs mining fees and takes time for them to be confirmed. Consider watching mining fees to broadcast your proposal at a reasonable cost. Waiting until late in the proposal phase to submit may cause it to not be confirmed in time.\n\nThe BSQ and BTC is automatically added to your proposal transaction by Bisq, but the BTC needs to be in your Bisq BTC wallet at the time you submit your proposal. Keep in mind that you’ll also need some BSQ and BTC for the other phases (vote & vote reveal).\n\nWhen you successfully submit your proposal in the DAO, it’ll propagate across the Bisq peer-to-peer network and be ready for stakeholders to vote on in the voting phase. If your request is approved, you will see the BSQ you requested in your wallet after the voting phase is over.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Making a reimbursement request", "content": "You might need to make a **reimbursement request** to the Bisq DAO if a disputed trade cannot be resolved through mediation. This article outlines the steps to make such a request.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## To be eligible for reimbursement you must make you request within 3 months of the trade\n\nReimbursement requests for trade can only considered by the Fee Reimbursement Agent if the user has opened a reimbursement request within 3 months of which ever is the latest; trade completing, trade failing, mediation summary proposed, arbitration summary received.\n\nIf a user would like to submit a reimbursement past this date they must do so through submitting a reimbursement request directly from the DAO and include a reason why they have waited >3 months before submitting their reimbursement request. They would also be expected to do all the work required to put forward their case independently rather than have the Fee Reimbursement Agent / Support Team complete the necessary work on their behalf.\n\n## Ensure no further action can be taken to resolve the dispute\n\nMaking a reimbursement request to the DAO should be a last resort.\n\nFirst make sure to:\n\n* Contact your trade's counterparty through the chat in the Bisq program. Traders are not required to respond, but many do, so it's worth a try.\n* Request mediation in the Bisq program. Mediators typically respond quickly, but they can take up to 2 days to respond. If you don't hear back within 2 days, feel free to reach out to your mediator on Matrix. Bisq assigns mediators to trades randomly. To find out which mediator is assigned to your trade, see this article.\n\nYour mediator will likely let you know if/when no further action can be taken on the dispute.\n\n## Escalate your case\n\nIn order to make a reimbursement request, you need to publish the time-locked payout transaction signed at the start of your trade. This transaction sends ''all'' trade funds (yours and those of the counterparty) to arbitration.\n\n**The only way to do this is to reject your mediator's suggestion in Bisq.**\n\nTo access your mediator's suggestion, click the View Proposed Resolution button:\n\nthumb|600px|left|Button to view mediator's suggested payout, so that you can reject it and enable arbitration.\n\n## Obtain the transaction ID of your published time-locked transaction\n\nThis transaction proves that your funds are no longer in the multisignature wallet, so it will be important to include this TXID in your reimbursement request (for others to verify).\n\nYou'll find the transaction details in Funds > Transactions, and it will be titled \"Refund collateral\":\n\nthumb|600px|left|Where to find the time-locked payout TXID.\n\n## Create an issue on GitHub\n\nBisq DAO requests have 2 parts: (1) a GitHub issue with all proposal details and (2) a proposal in the Bisq DAO itself pointing to a GitHub issue.\n\nThe GitHub issue needs to be made in Bisq's support repository. Voters cannot see the conversations you may have had with your counterparty and with your mediator, so your issue should include the circumstances of your dispute and all relevant details.\n\n[https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/new?title=Reimbursement%20for%20trade%20XXXXX&body=%3C!--%0A%0A**This%20is%20a%20template%20for%20reimbursement%20of%20disputed%20funds%20ONLY.**%0A%0AFor%20trade%20fee%20reimbursements%2C%20please%20use%20this%20this%20template%20instead%3A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbisq-network%2Fsupport%2Fissues%2Fnew%3Fassignees%3D%26labels%3D%26template%3Dreimbursement-template.md%26title%3DFee%2Breimbursement%2Bfor%2Btrade%2BXXXXX%0A%0A1.%20Replace%20%22XXXXX%22%20in%20this%20issue%27s%20title%20with%20the%20first%20digits%20of%20your%20trade%20ID%20before%20the%20dash.%0A2.%20List%20the%20circumstances%20of%20your%20dispute%2C%20being%20careful%20not%20to%20reveal%20any%20sensitive%20information%20about%20your%20or%20the%20trade%27s%20counterparty.%20%0A%0AAt%20a%20minimum%2C%20this%20should%20include%3A%0A%0A*%20full%20trade%20ID%0A*%20dispute%20details%3A%20what%20happened%0A*%20GitHub%20handle%20of%20mediator%20who%20handled%20your%20case%20(you%20can%20find%20it%20here%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fbisq.wiki%2FFinding_your_mediator)%0A*%20any%20other%20details%20that%20would%20help%20to%20convince%20bisq%20stakeholders%20that%20your%20request%20is%20a%20legitimate%20one%0A%0ASee%20further%20details%20on%20for%20making%20a%20reimbursement%20request%20here%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fbisq.wiki%2FMaking_a_reimbursement_request%0A%0A--%3E Use this template to make your issue].\n\nThe template recommends a list of items to include in your request, such as:\n\n* Full trade ID\n* Dispute details (what happened?)\n* GitHub handle (not Matrix handle!) of mediator who handled your case (here's how to find it)\n* TXID of your time-locked payout transaction\n* Any other details that would help to convince Bisq stakeholders that your request is legitimate\n\nIt's important that you tag your mediator so they are alerted of your request and can corroborate your claims. If your mediator doesn't reply to your issue within a couple of days, ping them on Matrix to make sure they saw it. Their explicit sign-off will be crucial for DAO voters to approve your request.\n\n**Please make sure not to include any sensitive information (e.g., payment account details) of ''either'' trade party.**\n\n## Submit your reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO\n\nOnce you've created the issue, you'll need to make the corresponding proposal in the Bisq DAO so stakeholders can vote on it in the next voting phase.\n\nTo make the proposal, simply go to DAO > Governance > Make Proposal, pick \"Reimbursement request\" in the drop-down, and fill in the details.\n\n**Triple-check before hitting Make Proposal**. Bisq DAO proposals are bitcoin transactions, so they cannot be reversed. You can delete a request and make a new one, if you really need to, but you will not get proposal fees back and you must delete before the end of the proposal phase in which the proposal was made.\n\nNew proposals can only be made during the proposal phase of a DAO cycle. If the Bisq DAO is not in the proposal phase, you'll need to wait for the next proposal phase to begin in order to make your reimbursement request. You'll see when the next proposal phase will begin in DAO > Governance > Make Proposal.\n\n600px|thumb|left|Creating reimbursement request proposal in the Bisq DAO.\n\n## Add a comment to your GitHub reimbursement request with your BSQ transaction ID\n\nTo ensure that someone else is not claiming for your reimbursement we ask that you post your reimbursement transaction ID as a comment on the GitHub issue.\n\nYou can access your transaction ID in the Bisq application by visiting DAO > BSQ Wallet > Transactions\n\nPlease copy your transaction ID and paste it as comment on your GitHub issue thus linking Bisq reimbursement request with the GitHub issue.\n\n## Sell your newly-issued BSQ for BTC\n\nOnce the voting phases of the cycle are over, if your request was approved, you'll see your newly-issued BSQ in DAO > BSQ Wallet.\n\nIf you'd like to exchange the BSQ for BTC this can be done on the BSQ/BTC market in the Bisq application.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Manual payout", "content": "## Overview\n\nFunds for a Bisq trade are locked in a 2-of-2 multisig that is controlled only by the two parties involved.\nBisq normally does all the work to sign and publish the payout at trade completion.\nHowever sometimes a trade can fail due to unforseen circumstances, leaving the funds stranded in the 2-of-2 multisig.\nWhen this happens, a Manual Payout may be necessary.\n\n## Using Bisq's Manual Payout tool\n\nThe emergency payout tool is in Bisq, if you do a CTRL-G it will open.\n\nThe purpose of the tool is to allow owners of a 2of2 multisig to issue a transaction which pays out the funds to their addresses. The tool is designed to be used in collaboration with mediators but\nit could conceivably be used by the multisig key holders alone.\n\nThe tool operates in 4 steps:\n\n# Fill input information;\n# Import/export details to trade participants;\n# Sign using each holder's private key;\n# Build and broadcast the payout.\n\n## = Fill in inputs\n=\n\nInput information can be either filled in manually using information from the Bisq trade's Json contract, or for ease of use the same information can be imported from the Mediation ticket.\n\n* If filling in manually, all fields on the \"Inputs\" tab must be entered.\n* If importing from Mediation, choose the Import menu option then pick your mediation ticket from the drop down list and press \"Import from mediation ticket\".\n\nOne important thing which the tool prompts you for is the \"amountInMultisig\" field. This value is not known in Bisq, so the user (or Mediator) has to look it up on a Blockchain explorer and enter it completely accurately into the tool. If it is incorrect in any way the resultant transaction will fail. (Reason for this is that Segwit includes the amount as part of the signature inputs).\n\n## = Import/Export to trade participants\n=\n\nOnce accurate input information has been entered, the same information needs to be passed to both owners of the multisig keys (the two traders). This is what the \"Export\" menu item is for. It translates the input field data into a code which can be DM'd or emailed to the participants, which they can enter via the \"Import\" menu (& \"Import from String\" option).\n\nThe important thing is that each participant have EXACTLY the same information entered into the Inputs section of the tool. If there is any discrepancy between the inputs that each participant signs, then the transaction will be invalid.\n\nNote that if the two traders have access to the mediation ticket they can Import from the ticket themselves. But it is generally best for Mediator to Export their filled in fields to both traders (via DM).\n\n## = Sign\n=\n\nBoth participants have to sign the inputs. This is done from the Sign menu, for convenience there is a \"Locate key in wallet\" button which will scan the user's wallet for a key which matches the inputs. \"Generate signature\" will sign the inputs using the key at the top of the screen. Users could alternatively choose to locate the key themselves, and paste it into the \"privateKeyHex\" field before doing \"Generate signature\".\n\nOnce the signature has been generated each participant should send it to the person who will build and broadcast the transaction (usually the Mediator).\n\n## = Build & Broadcast\n=\n\nOnce both signatures have been provided, they can be pasted into the Build screen at which time the \"Build\" button at the bottom of that screen should be pressed. It will generate the TxID and transaction hex into the text area. The transaction hex can be verified using your own tools* or simply broadcast to the network using the \"Broadcast\" button (or alternatively send it yourself using your Bitcoin node).\n\n* NB: \"https://bitaps.com/broadcast\" has a \"Preview\" feature that tests if the transaction is acceptable to the mempool before actually sending it. Any errors in the transaction will be listed, or if it is good it will say \"Test mempool transaction accepted\" and give the option to broadcast it at that point.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Participating in a DAO voting cycle", "content": "**Participating in a DAO voting cycle** is something any stakeholder can do—Bisq trader, contributor, or anyone else who wants to help the project succeed.\n\nThis article covers how to make a proposal and vote on other proposals, as well as how the BSQ token enables this process to be handled in a decentralized and trustless but meritocratic way.\n\nFor a brief overview of how the Bisq DAO works at a high level, see the DAO introduction article.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Background\n\nAs covered in the Introduction to the DAO article, the Bisq DAO's governance model helps achieve several functions for the Bisq project.\n\nThis governance model is composed of voting cycles: periods of 4,679 blocks (approximately 1 month) made of 4 phases:\n# **Proposal phase**, in which stakeholders submit compensation requests and other proposals requesting reimbursements for trading fees, changes in trading parameters, or changes in some other aspect of the Bisq project. After the proposal phase is over, there is a break of 150 blocks (about 1 day) to review and discuss proposals before voting begins.\n# **Blind voting phase**, in which stakeholders cast their votes on submitted proposals. Votes are encrypted in this phase to prevent later voters from being influenced by earlier voters. Following the end of the blind voting phase, there is a break of 10 blocks to protect against reorgs.\n# **Vote reveal phase**, in which each stakeholder sends the decryption key for their vote. Again, for protection against reorgs, there is a break of 10 blocks after this phase is over.\n# **Vote result phase**, in which vote results are calculated and BSQ is issued accordingly.\n\nYou can see approximate start and end dates for the current voting cycle at DAO > Governance > Dashboard.\n\n700px|thumb|left|DAO blocks and estimated calendar times.\n\n## Acquire BSQ\n\nIn order to participate in DAO voting, you will need BSQ. See how to acquire BSQ in this article.\n\nAs of this writing, making a proposal costs 2 BSQ and casting a ballot (voting) costs 2 BSQ. You'll also need some plain BTC for transaction fees (each DAO action is a bitcoin transaction which requires mining fees to be paid), and if you will be asking for compensation or reimbursement, you'll need to include some plain BTC to be colored into BTC (precise amount is 100 satoshis × [requested BSQ amount]).\n\nKeep this in mind when buying BSQ to get started for the first time, and make sure you have a BTC balance in your Bisq wallet that's sufficient for what you want to do.\n\n## Make a proposal\n\n**Please read this article on proposals before submitting a proposal for voting.** Bisq proposals tend to be for significant items, and proposals submitted to the DAO are typically for ''controversial'' significant items.\n\nIn DAO > Governance > Make Proposal, you’ll find the form to make a new proposal. Pick the type of proposal you want to make from the dropdown, fill the form, and hit Make Proposal.\n* Make sure the GitHub handle you put in Bisq matches the GitHub handle on the issue.\n* Also make sure to replace # with the GitHub proposal number. For example, if submitting proposal #999 with URL https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/999, the DAO proposal URL should be https://bisq.network/dao-proposals/999.\n\nHere's how making a generic proposal can look:\n\n700px|thumb|left|Submit a generic proposal for DAO voting.\n\n## Vote on proposals\n\nOnce the proposal phase is over, after a short break, the voting phase starts.\n\nYou can see all proposals in the current voting cycle in DAO > Governance > Browse Open Proposals.\n\nClick through each proposal to see more details, and then vote—it’s strongly recommended that you only accept or reject proposals you know well and have a strong opinion about.\n\n400px|thumb|left|Cast votes for proposals during the blind voting phase.\n\n## Submit votes\n\nWhen you’re done selecting your votes, you will need to submit your votes.\n\n400px|thumb|left|Select voting weight and submit all votes.\n\nAll votes are submitted in a single ballot. Casting a ballot currently costs 2 BSQ + mining fees.\n\nIn addition, to submit your votes, you need to specify a BSQ amount to use for **voting stake**. The more BSQ you stake for your vote, the more weight it will carry. This staked BSQ cannot be traded or otherwise transferred until your vote reveal transaction is published.\n\nThe software has checks to prevent such BSQ from being spent, but if BSQ staked for voting is somehow spent, the corresponding vote will be rendered invalid.\n\nThis is why, as you see in the screenshot to the left, it's advisable to use most (but not all) of your BSQ for the voting stake—we left some BSQ available for spending in case we need it for other purposes during the remainder of the voting cycle.\n\nVote weight from earned BSQ is BSQ earned from contributing to Bisq: this BSQ is treated slightly differently from BSQ bought on the open market when determining a stakeholder’s voting weight.\n\nOnce you’ve entered a voting stake, go ahead and click Vote on all proposals.\n\n## Reveal your vote\n\n\nAfter the blind voting phase is over, you must make sure Bisq goes back online at some point during the vote reveal phase to publish your vote reveal transaction.\n\nBisq will publish the transaction automatically when it’s online, so you don’t have to actually do anything, and you’ll see a pop-up when the transaction is published.\n\nThis transaction includes the key to decrypt your vote from the blind voting phase. It also includes a representation of all votes you’ve received from the network, which is used to determine a consensus of all votes cast on the network. See more details here.\n\n**Don’t forget this step! If your vote reveal transaction is not published, your vote cannot be decrypted, and so it cannot be counted.**\n\n## Get vote results\n\nOnce the vote reveal phase is over, results are calculated and the next voting cycle starts.\n\nYou can see results of the last voting cycle in DAO > Governance > Vote Results.\n\n700px|thumb|left|Submit a generic proposal for DAO voting.\n\n## See DAO transactions on a block explorer\n\nSince DAO transactions are bitcoin transactions, you can see them on any bitcoin block explorer. But because transactions use BSQ (bitcoin colored in a way that only Bisq understands), ordinary bitcoin block explorers can’t recognize which bitcoin transactions are also BSQ transactions.\n\nHence [https://explorer.bisq.network BSQ block explorers]. Whenever you do a Bisq DAO transaction, including paying trading fees with BSQ, you can see it on a BSQ block explorer.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the past few BSQ transactions that took place at the end of Cycle 23:\n\n700px|thumb|left|A listing of Bisq DAO transactions on mempool.space.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Security deposit", "content": "**Security deposits** in Bisq are BTC funds that buyer and seller lock in a 2of2 multisig address together with trade funds when an offer is taken in order to help ensure that both peers follow the trading protocol. Security deposits are fully reimbursed automatically to both trading peers when the trade ends without disputes.\n\nSecurity deposits are the most important tool Bisq offers to protect honest traders. Furthermore, requiring ''both'' parties to post a deposit increases chances that they will be willing to cooperate and determine amicable outcomes in case a trade doesn't go according to plan.\n\nWhen a trade doesn't go the happy path, a portion or the total amount of the offending peer's deposit will be lost, depending on whether the trade is concluded in mediation or arbitration. For example, it is considered a protocol violation when the buyer doesn't pay the seller as specified in the trade contract (e.g., late payment, mismatching names, wrong payment method, etc). This article lists all Bisq trading rules.\n\n## Note for new users\n\nSecurity deposits create a conundrum for new users: **bitcoin is required to buy bitcoin**. This can be inconvenient, but it's a core part of the security protocol. The initial amount of BTC required to do a trade can vary depending on the payment method, but the bare minimum BTC required to buy more BTC (as of this writing) is 0.002 BTC to cover the minimum security deposit and mining fees. Take a look at this article for suggestion on how to get this initial BTC without KYC (Bisq Easy, Get your first BTC room, a friend, ATM, sell something, work for it, etc).\n\nWhy the hard security deposit requirement? Bisq never custodies your funds, and it avoids reputation mechanisms that would weaken your privacy (e.g., reviews: to such reputation data, it must be stored somewhere ''and'' tied to an identity). Such mechanisms would only give a false sense of security anyway due to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attacks].\n\n## Recommended amounts\n\nBisq allows offer makers to choose a security deposit percentage: **minimum is 15%** of trade amount and **maximum is 50%** of trade amount (absolute minimum is 0.001 BTC). The offer taker must deposit the same amount as the offer maker.\n\nWhen creating an offer, Bisq recommends a security deposit based on recent volatility of the asset being traded: **the higher the volatility, the higher the recommended security deposit**. Using the recommended amount helps prevent trades from becoming future trades where the BTC buyer only sends payment to settle the trade if the BTC price has not fallen enough to compensate for losing the security deposit.\n\n500px|thumb|left|Depending on volatility, recommended security deposits can reach 50%.\n\nWhen taking an offer, the security deposit set by the maker can be viewed on the Deposit BTC (%) column.\n500px|thumb|left|See required deposit % in this column on the offer book.\n\n## Reduced peer's deposit payout during arbitration\n\nThe latest trade protocol, which introduced contributors as BurningMen, to eliminate the single-point-of-failure that was the legacy BurningMan, implies that the trader winning in arbitration will get a considerably smaller (if at all) portion of the peer's deposit as compensation, to account for the risk of malicious BM's exploiting the protocol itself.\nIf you want to minimize the risk of having funds locked in arbitration for a prolonged time without any compensation after the resolution, you should take into account [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/411 this table], and set a deposit % higher than the minimum amount possible, which will yield no compensation whatsoever.", "category": "bisq1"}

Frequently Asked Questions has a similar section with issues that traders could solve by their own.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## =Trade transaction structure\n=\nIf there are any issues with transactions or doubt if the deposit or delayed payout tx is correct you can check it in a block explorer by following the transactions outputs.\n\nThere are 5 diff. txs:\n* Maker fee tx\n* Taker fee tx\n* Deposit tx\n* Delayed payout tx (only get broadcast when arbitration gets opened)\n* Payout tx\n\n**The 2 trade fee txs have as first output the trade fee.** That goes either to one of the BTC receiver addresses ([1] and [2]) or to a BSQ change address of the user in case BSQ was used for the fee (the diff from BSQ input and change output is used for miner fee and is the burned BSQ).\n**The second output of both trade fee txs must lead to the (same) deposit tx**. The deposit tx has an OpReturn and the first output is to a multiSig address (start with `3` if non-segwit or with `bc1` if segwit). There can be an optional change output if trade amount was smaller than max. offer amount, but there are never more then 2 outputs + opReturn.\nIf the delayed payout tx or the normal payout tx was published you see that the first output of the deposit tx (the MS output) is spent and lead to one of those txs as the single input. The normal payout tx has exactly 2 outputs, 1 address for each trader and that addresses are dispayed in the trade/ticket details.\nThe delayed payout tx need to have exactly 1 input and 1 output to one of the addresses listed in [1] and [3]. **If arbitration is opened this tx MUST exist otherwise a refund MUST NOT be made**. The input must be the multisig output of the deposit tx (we have a code to check if its the deposit tx of the trade and not any past one - if a popup in mediation or arbitration tells you that there is an issue, take it serious and contact devs for advice).\n\nTo check the txs (and addresses) use a block explorer which shows clearly the inputs and outputs, not all explorers have a very intuitive UI to follow the flows of txs. If you select the addresses like in the below screenshot you can see the flow pretty clearly.\n\nthumb\n\nthumb\n\nthumb\n\nChecking if the trade fee tx leads to the deposit tx helps to quickly see if the trade funds are locked up and all is ok with the trade. If that is not the case the traders might have lost trade fee (if their trade fee tx is published - if one side is missing that user has not lost trade fee so no fee reimbursement is justified, such users need to do a SPV resync as the tx is likely committed in their wallet but not in the mempool due to too low fees or a bug at broadcast).\n\n## =One trade fee tx not found in mempool\n=\nIn case the miner fee was too low or due broadcast problems (bad network connectivity or bug) it can be that one of the trade fee txs is not getting confirmed or has not been broadcast.\nAfter a few days unconfirmed tx gets removed from the bitcoin nodes mempool (size of mempool is a local setting for each node/explorer so it can be that its visible in some explorers but in others not).\nIn such cases the deposit tx cannot be confirmed as well. Instruct the trader who's tx was not confirmed that he does a SPV resync so that the tx gets cleaned from his local wallet.\nOtherwise there is high risk that the change output gets used for another tx and that will fail then as well. Best to deactivate all open offers to avoid that a taker could take an offer before the wallet is resynced.\nThe trader who has the confirmed trade fee tx has lost his trade fee and can request for reimbursement.\n\n## =SPV resync\n=\nSPV resync tends to be recommened too often in support.\nSPV resync can be quite heavy and is not a great user experience to do, so only recommend if really needed.\nHow long a SPV takes depends on the age of the wallet and the number of transactions.\nOld wallets with many transactions can take a day or even more. Usually with a fresh empty wallet its about some minutes up to 1 hour.\nIt is faster if the user runs a local BTC node (not pruned). It also depends on internet connection and amount of CPU/RAM. CPU will be maxed out during sync.\n\nSPV resync is needed if there is a transaction in the wallet which never got confirmed. You can check for that by looking up the tx in several block explorers, if its not found in any then its pretty sure that tx got removed from mempool. This is expected in case miner fee was too low or when the tx broadcast failed.\nAnother reason to do a SPV resync is when there is a message that the wallet contains a `double spend` tx. This is usually not intentional done by the user but due to some errors or reorgs in rare cases.\nThere might be other more rare error conditions, but for those I recommend to contact the devs before recommending a SPV resync as it will help as well to fix potential bugs.\n\nIf users do not get connected to the BTC network do NOT recommend SPV resync.\nPotential reasons are:\n\n* User runs Bitcoin node in not pruned mode\n* Bitcoin node is not full synced when Bisq start (Bitcoin node need to always be full synced before starting Bisq)\n* User had set custom BTC node in settings or prog arg and has changed his setup\n* Connection issues\n* Tor issues\n\n## =Connection issues\n=\nIn rare cases Tor can cause problems. If no connection can be created after several restarts and if user is sure to have normal connectivity he should clean the Tor files via `Settings/Network/Tor settings`. He should make a backup first and not do it manually. Deleting the hiddenservice directory would make his node inaccessible as he would create a new onion address! If there are no open offers/trades/disputes and user dont care to lose his local reputation it is not problematic to delete the onion priv key. In some rare cases that can help as well (I saw in rare cases the changing the onion address solved Tor connection issues).\nTor has some ddos protection which can lead to get flagged an IP address. We see that from time to time on seed nodes and its likely caused by too much traffic or some traffic pattern which Tor interprets as ddos. In such cases changing the IP should help. Using a VPN can help to check if thats the problem (I had it once myself that I could not use Tor anymore and only via VPN it worked). After a few weeks it was ok again so it seems those bans fade out over time. Testing with Tor browser is another option to see if Tor itself has issues (does not cover issues if the onion address or cache files).\n\nIf network speed is very low (< 2 Mbit/sec) there might be connection timouts. We improved some data requests already and will improve more in upcoming releases but specially at startup the BTC sync and getData requests can be a bit heavy, specially if Bisq was not used for a while. Doing repeated startups can help as some data gets persisted and at next request less data is required. Using a local Bitcoin node helps as well as the BTC sync is then not adding up to tor traffic.\nIf the user has not used Bisq since more then a month he should update to latest version and then delete some files in the `db` directory inside the data directory. Then those files get replaced by more recent ones which go shipped with the latest binary. that avoids to need to download the missing data from seed nodes (seed nodes have limits as well of amount of delivered data). Those files are:\n* DaoStateStore\n* SignedWitnessStore\n* AccountAgeWitnessStore\n* BlindVoteStore\n* ProposalStore\n\nPlease note that deleting or manipulating files inside the db directory is usually not recommended and can cause severe problems! Some files are basically only cache files from public data like the ones above, those are not critical, but other data are local private data and would lead to a corrupted state or failed trades.\n\n**BTC Balance issues Connection issues**\nThere is a wallet info tool which can be opened with cmd+j. There you see all the raw data of the wallet: Addresses, public and private keys, txs, balance of both BTC and BSQ. Can be useful for investigation.\nAnother option is the open the emergency wallet tool by cmd+e. There one can withdraw all available funds (not including locked up funds in multisig). The displayed balance there is the sum of\nthe available balance + reserved in offers balance.\n\nIt is not recommended to use the BTC private keys outside of Bisq. It always can be recovered from Bisq. I am not aware of any case where funds got lost. Spending BTC outside of Bisq can lead to failed taker offer attempts, failed trades or double spends in Bisq and can screw up the wallet.\nFor those who still want to do it here are the HD wallet paths:\nBTC wallet segwit path is: M/44H/0H/1H\nBTC wallet legacy path is: M/44H/0H/0H\nBSQ wallet path is: M/44H/142H/0H\n\nBSQ should never be used outside of Bisq as the risk to burn the BSQ is very high. A BSQ tx has very strict rules how it is constructed and small mistakes lead to lost BSQ.\n\n## =Backup\n=\n* If a user reports a bug tell user to make a backup of data dir. This can help that relevant log files and rolling backups are still available later.\nRolling backup means that old files get deleted (e.g. bisq10.log is oldest log file) once the max. number files is reached, so we can only go back a certain depth back in history.\n* Tell users to always make a full backup of the data dir. Seed node is only an emergency backup and if there are open trades funds are at risk (e.g. no communication possible with mediator/peer, or manual payout required).\n* Every db and wallet file has a backup folder with the rolling backups. They are named with the unix epoch timestamp. Replace an existing file with a backup file should be done only in emergency cases and only if dev gives the advice.\n\n**Start over with a new data directory**\nSee https://bisq.community/t/how-to-switch-to-a-new-data-directory/7583 for more details\n\n**Logs**\n\nLog files are pretty verbose and a big hard to interpret for no developers but a few useful information can be easily extraced:\nIf you search for `VERSION=` you can see the users version. It gets logged at startup. If the user has once updated there must never follow a lower version in flater log entries. Downgrade is not supported and caused severe problems at the segwit update. After 1.5.0 we protect that downgrade is not possible, but will only have affect in next version after 1.5.0.\nIf you look for an error search for ERROR (all uppercase). But as there are some non critical errors as well (e.g. caused from broken connections) its better to leave that interpretation to devs. If you post errors post the stacktrace as well if it is available or at least a few log lines before and after the error so it is easier to get an idea what caused it.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Trade payout address reuse issue", "content": "It can rarely happen that, while buying BTC on Bisq, your trade will be reported as completed, but you see no incoming transaction into your wallet for the expected amount (trade amount + security deposit).\n\nOne of the possible causes of this event is what we call the \"address reuse bug\".\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Telltale signs of the address reuse bug\n\nOne very circumstantial evidence of this bug, is the trade completing almost instantly after you click the PAYMENT STARTED button. This is especially true when you would expect, on the other side, that another human needs the time to notice that the payment notification was sent, then verify having received said payment, and that it corresponds to what the trade details say, and finally get back to Bisq to release the BTC locked in the deposit transaction. If instead the trade closed in a matter of a few minutes, usually much less, it is possible this issue occurred.\n\nAnother obvious sign, is that you find no incoming transactions in your Bisq wallet, under FUNDS > TRANSACTIONS, that correspond to (trade amount + security deposit).\n\n## Prevention\n\nNoticing the issue in due time allows to cover for possible escalations, if the best case scenario (see below) doesn't play out.\n\nAll that is needed is to forewarn mediators (or any support agent) about the issue, using one of the support channels, communicating the trade ID and your onion address, so if a dispute is opened, the assigned mediator will know how to contact the buyer outside of the application.\n\n## Possible solutions\n\nWhile this issue can be annoying, and especially worrying for new users who have just started experiencing a new trading platform, the usual resolution path is a spontaneous and uneventful one, and requires no intervention whatsoever on the buyer's part.\n\n## = Normal payout (best case scenario)\n=\n\nEven if the BTC buyer sees a completed trade on his side, the BTC seller will be presented with the correct state, where he has received the ''Payment has been started'' notification, and is prompted to verify that the money has reached his account before releasing the BTC (by pressing the PAYMENT RECEIVED button, thus signing his part of the multisig and broadcasting the trade payout transaction).\n\nWhen the above happens, the trade really completes, and the buyer will receive the due BTC in his wallet.\n\nIt is actually possible that some cases of this bug go unnoticed, for those trades where fast payment methods are used, and there is but a delay of 10-15 minutes between buyer's Bisq reporting the trade as closed, and seller's Bisq actually sending the funds.\n\n## = Mediation\n=\n\nSince the buyer instance considers the trade completed, the trader chat will not be accessible to the buyer, not even in read only mode. This means that the seller will effectively see an unresponsive peer, which is not a problem per se (traders are not required to respond in trader chat, after all) but if other issues arise, that could be easily solved by a simple exchange between the peers, which won't be possible in this scenario, the seller could open a support ticket on his side, requesting the aid of a mediator.\nJust like the buyer will not have access to trader chat, he will also not be able to even know that mediation was opened. But, if he had followed the instructions in the Prevention section above, mediation would still be possible since he could communicate with his mediator via external chat, for example.\n\n## = Arbitration (worst case scenario)\n=\n\nArbitration should be generally avoided at all costs, but if mediation is not successful, either because the seller opened mediation and the buyer didn't follow instructions in the Prevention section above, or, with a very unlucky turn of events, because the seller went missing for whatever reason, leaving the deposit tx locked, recurring to the Refund Agent is the only way left to access the trade funds.\n\nIf the latter is true, and the buyer needs to open arbitration, contacting support is indispensable, because the buyer will have to be guided through the procedure to manually publish the Delayed Payout Transaction on the blockchain, that in turn will start arbitration.\n\nNo matter who will open arbitration, either seller or buyer, the latter will have to communicate with Refund Agent through a separate channel, usually via support chat, to follow through.\n\n## Technical explanation\n\nIn order to consider a trade as closed, the Bisq instance on the buyer's side needs to monitor an incoming transaction to a specific address of the internal wallet, and as soon as the payout amount is received to this address, Bisq can consider the trade completed because the locked BTC was released.\n\nIf, for any reason, the application associates to the ongoing trade a payout address which was already used in a previous trade, said address will have already received funds (from the previous trade), and that is why as soon as the buyer presses PAYMENT STARTED, Bisq will start looking for incoming transaction to that previously used address, immediately finding the previous payout and closing the trade as completed.\n\nThe presumed cause for this was identified once, and patched, but there appears to be another edge case which still leads to the issue. If you experience this bug, please send your logs through support, so the additional causes can be identified and fixed.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Trading BSQ", "content": "**BSQ** is the native token of the Bisq DAO, used optionally for paying trading fees at a discount and required for certain governance functions like voting and making proposals. This page explains why you might want BSQ and how to obtain it.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Why Obtain or Use BSQ?\n\nThere are two main reasons users acquire and use BSQ:\n\n* **For Traders:** Using BSQ to pay trading fees provides a significant discount (target is ~50%, re-calibrated each DAO cycle (approximately monthly) - see Updating BSQ trading fees) compared to paying fees in BTC. See Paying trading fees with BSQ.\n* **For Contributors:** BSQ is required to make proposals and vote in the Bisq DAO. Contributors also receive compensation for their work in BSQ, which they might then sell on the Bisq market for BTC. See Introduction to the DAO.\n\n## How to Obtain BSQ (Recommended Method: Swaps)\n\nSince Bisq v1.8.0, the primary, recommended, and default method for trading between BTC and BSQ within the Bisq application is via **BSQ swaps**.\n\n* **What are Swaps?** BSQ swaps allow BSQ and BTC to be traded **atomically** in a single Bitcoin transaction. This makes the process:\n* **Trustless:** No counterparty risk during the exchange.\n* **Instantaneous:** The swap happens as soon as the transaction confirms on the blockchain.\n* **Cheaper:** Involves significantly lower mining fees compared to the old multi-transaction protocol.\n* **Simpler:** Does not require setting up a specific \"BSQ payment account\".\n* **How to Swap:** Simply go to the **Create Offer** or **Buy / Sell BTC** screens in Bisq and select BSQ as the counter-currency against BTC. You can then make or take offers just like any other market. Ensure you have sufficient BTC or BSQ in your Bisq wallet to cover the trade amount and any fees.\n\nFile:Bisq-v1-buy-bsq-offer-book.png|Offer book showing offers where you can **buy** BSQ with BTC (BSQ Swaps).\nFile:Bisq-v1-sell-bsq-offer-book.png|Offer book showing offers where you can **sell** BSQ for BTC (BSQ Swaps).\n\nFor full technical details on how the swap protocol works, see the main **BSQ swaps** page.\n\n## Receiving BSQ\n\nIf you need to receive BSQ (e.g., for contributor compensation, or from an external source), you can find your BSQ receiving address in the built-in Bisq wallet:\n# Go to the `DAO` tab.\n# Select the `BSQ wallet` sub-tab.\n# Click the `Receive` button/tab.\n# Your current BSQ receiving address will be displayed. Click the copy icon to copy it.\n\n600px|thumb|left|Find your BSQ receiving address under DAO > BSQ Wallet > Receive.\n\n## Deprecated Trading Method\n\nPreviously, BSQ was traded using a manual process similar to other altcoins, requiring users to create a specific BSQ altcoin payment account. This method was deprecated in favor of BSQ swaps (introduced in v1.8.0) because swaps are faster, cheaper, more secure (atomic), and easier to use. The old method offers no advantages and should no longer be used.\n\nCategory:Guides\nCategory:DAO\nCategory:BSQ", "category": "bisq1"}

But you can set up an Altcoins Instant account on Bisq for 1-hour trade periods.\n\n= Proving payments =\n\nSome details of XMR transactions are not publicly available on the blockchain. In order for a mediator or arbitrator to handle disputes, the XMR seller must make sure they send XMR using a wallet that provides the following 3 items to prove the payment was made:\n# transaction key (Tx Key, Tx Secret Key, or Tx Private Key)\n# transaction ID (Tx ID or Tx Hash)\n# recipient's address\n\nThis information can be found in the following wallets: official Monero GUI and CLI wallets, MyMonero, Exodus (desktop), Cake Wallet, and Monerujo (mobile):\n\n* Monero GUI: on the Transactions tab.\n* Monero CLI: use the command get_tx_key . The flag store-tx-info must be enabled (it's enabled by default in new versions).\n* Other wallets: go to transaction history and look for transaction key (sometimes called \"tx key\" or \"secret key\") and destination address in a sent transaction. For Cake Wallet, the \"Save recipient address\" option must be enabled in settings.\n\nIf you are using another wallet not mentioned above, be sure you can still access the 3 items mentioned above.\n\nSince transaction keys and destination addresses are stored in Monero wallet software and not available anywhere else, be careful not to delete or restore your Monero wallet before a Bisq trade is complete.\n\n**Failure to provide the required transaction data will result in losing disputes.**\n\n= Verifying payments =\n\nTo verify that a certain sum of Monero was sent to a specific address:\n* Monero GUI: change wallet to Advanced mode and go to Advanced > Prove/check > Check Transaction\n* Monero CLI: use the command check_tx_key\n\n* [https://monero.com/explorer Monero.com explorer] - working checked 17.10.23\n* [https://p2pool.io/explorer/ P2pool explorer] - working checked 17.10.23\n* [https://xmrchain.net/ XMR Chain] - working checked 17.10.23\n* [https://www.exploremonero.com/receipt Explore Monero website] - working checked 26.11.23\n* [https://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html XMR Check Transaction tool] - not working checked 17.10.23\n\nIf you still have questions, see [https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html this guide on the Monero home page] or ask a question on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/monerosupport/ Monero support subreddit].\n\n= Auto-confirming trades =\n\nAuto-confirming trades verify receipt of XMR payment automatically. Typically, XMR buyers must check their wallet and manually mark a payment as received in Bisq. Auto-confirming trades do this automatically, making trades quicker and more efficient for both traders.\n\nThis feature is currently available for XMR trades where:\n* the XMR seller provides a valid transaction key or viewkey\n* the XMR buyer has auto-confirming trades turned on in Bisq settings\n\nAuto confirming works very well most of the time. However on some occasions users might be manually required to confirm payment, for example then the incorrect data is supplied by the BTC buyer.\n\nBy default auto-confirming trades is turned on in the Bisq app, if you wist to turn if off it can be done in Settings > Preferences:\n\nframe|left|XMR auto confirm\n\n## How it works\n\n## = XMR Seller\n=\n\nThe XMR seller will get a pop-up upon clicking Payment Sent asking for the XMR tx ID and XMR tx key.\n\n600px|thumb|left|The XMR seller can choose to enter this information, or not.\n\nThe trader can choose to enter this information, or not. **It is not mandatory**. If the trader chooses not to, they'll be informed that their trading peer will not be able to use auto-confirm.\n\n## = XMR Buyer\n=\n\nThe XMR buyer must have auto-confirm turned on in Bisq settings.\n\n500px|thumb|left|Auto-confirm status on the trade screen. In this particular instance, the XMR seller didn't specify the information needed for auto-confirm to work.\n\nExplorer nodes are queried every 90 seconds for 12 hours. If 12 hours pass without success, auto-confirm fails for the trade. If Bisq receives just 1 failure of any kind (related to transaction, network issues, etc), auto-confirm is considered failed. **This does not mean the XMR transaction was invalid.** It just means the user should check the transaction manually.\n\nThe user can mark the transaction as received any time by clicking Confirm Payment Receipt themselves, and auto-confirm will stop running for that trade and the trade will be completed normally.\n\n## Settings\n\nOn the Bisq settings screen, you can set:\n* Maximum amount of BTC that can be confirmed per trade (default: 1 BTC)\n* Monero Explorer node address (default: nodes run by Bisq contributors; see below for how to run your own)\n* Number of required confirmations (default: 5)\n\nPlease note that changes to these settings are applied immediately only for trades for which payment hasn't been started yet. Restart Bisq for updated settings to apply to all trades.\n\n**Changing the required number of confirmations is an exception: it takes effect immediately for all trades.**\n\nDisabling the auto-confirm feature altogether also takes effect immediately. But re-enabling the feature will only take effect on trades for which payment hasn't been started yet; restart Bisq for the auto-update feature to apply to all trades.\n\n600px|thumb|left\n\n## Monero Explorer nodes\n\nBy default, the Bisq auto-confirm feature relies on [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/107 a few Monero Explorers operated by Bisq contributors], but we highly recommend you to run your own Monero Explorer node at home.

Fees can be paid in BSQ or BTC.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Getting a discount\n\nBisq encourages traders to use BSQ by offering a discount of approximately 50%. This discount fluctuates as the BSQ/BTC rate fluctuates. To maintain the 50% discount target, trading fees are updated every cycle as necessary.\n\n## Current rates\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 250px;\"\n|+ Trading Fees per 1 BTC\n|-\n!\n!BTC\n!BSQ\n|-\n!Maker\n|0.0015\n|43.32\n|-\n!Taker\n|0.0115\n|332.12\n|}\n\nCombined BTC trading fee rate is 1.3% (0.15% by maker and 1.15% by taker).

Absolute minimum fee to avoid dust is 0.03 BSQ.\n\nTrading fee rates and absolute minimums are DAO parameters that must be proposed and approved through DAO voting in order to take effect. BTC fee rates tend to stay constant, but BSQ rates are adjusted every cycle to account for BSQ rate fluctuation.\n\n## Selecting how to pay\n\nTraders choose how they'd prefer to pay trading fees while making or taking an offer.

{"title": "Trading rules", "content": "Both Bisq traders must follow these **trading rules** to ensure smooth and successful trades.\n\nTo trade on Bisq, you assume one of two roles, no matter what national currency or cryptocurrency you’re trading: you either ''buy bitcoin'' or ''sell bitcoin''.\n\nThe rules below are **default** rules for every transaction. Offer makers sometimes specify their own additional terms for handling payments. For example, a seller using cash deposits might require a picture of a receipt torn in half with \"NO REFUND\" written on it. Face-to-face traders often specify terms about where and how to meet.\n\nMake sure you’re okay with an offer-maker’s terms **before** you accept an offer!\n\nTrade rules also help with the following:\n\n* Promoting good behavior from traders\n* Penalizing bad behavior from traders\n* Promoting good payment accounts of traders\n* Penalizing bad payment accounts of traders\n* Put the 'wrong doer' in a worse position and the person 'not at fault' in a better position\n\n= Common rules =\n\n## = No requirement to reply in trader chat\n=\n\nWhile using the available trade chat can be helpful to resolve issues directly among traders without the overhead of mediation, and being communicative is a good way to ease the process for new traders, there is no obligation to reply to a peer's messages.\n\n## = Do not communicate with your peer away from Bisq\n=\n\nUsing email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is strongly discouraged. The trader chat feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader’s chat messages indicate they broke a rule). This includes advertising offers to sell BTC with a way to contact you, for example a website, Telegram user name, or email.\n\nIn any case, it is forbidden to contact the peer using contacts obtained from their payment details, without their prior consent, or missing a compelling reason to do so.\n\n## = Be responsive during a dispute\n=\n\nTraders are expected to reply within 48hrs to either mediators or arbitrators, and could lose the dispute based on unresponsiveness.\n\nMediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.\n\n## = Do not change payment details once trade is in progress\n=\n\nOnce the deposit transaction is published, the trade is in progress, and its terms cannot be changed. Traders agreed to use the payment details specified in the trade contract.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected circumstance (e.g. hitting a bank-imposed transfer limit, or a payment institution interfering with the transaction), traders can propose alternatives through trader chat or mediation, but the peer is not required to comply. It is each trader's responsibility to ensure that the payment account in their offer will work before an offer is taken.\n\n= Rules for bitcoin sellers =\n\nWhether making or taking an offer, bitcoin sellers put all the bitcoin they’re selling in the multisig escrow, so there’s less for them to do and fewer rules they need to follow.\n\n## = Click Confirm payment after receiving payment\n=\n\nSellers have until the end of the maximum trade period to do so.\n\nAccount signing, introduced in Bisq v1.2, enables a seller with a signed payment account to sign a buyer’s payment account when they successfully receive a payment. For such trades, it is recommended that the seller take as long as possible (i.e., wait until close to the end of the trade period) to confirm receipt of payment to reduce the chance of a chargeback.\n\n## = Do not confirm payments with mismatching details\n=\n\nPayer name, account numbers, payment method, institution, and other details of a payment should match the details in the trade contract. If there are any concerns that buyer's payment details do not match (e.g. wrong name, account number etc) payment should not be accepted.'''\n\n= Rules for bitcoin buyers =\n\n## = Make payment reasonably early within trade period\n=\n\nBuyer should complete at a time such that the seller has enough time to acknowledge receipt of the payment before the trade period is over. Waiting until the very end of the trade period to make a payment is not advised, as then the seller cannot reasonably act in time to acknowledge receipt (also, it’s annoying). The lengths of trade periods vary based on payment method.\n\nThis is especially important for buyers with unsigned payment accounts trading with sellers with signed payment accounts. A seller will not want to confirm receipt of a payment made at the last minute from an untrusted account, so if you’re a buyer looking to get your payment account signed, you should make the payment ''as soon as possible''.\n\nSome payment methods include an option to cancel a payment after you have sent it eg Revolut and Interac e-Transfer. If you cancel payment without agreement with the seller or mediator you might end up being penalized for cancelling the trade.\n\n## = Click Payment started after sending payment\n=\n\nSeller cannot mark payment as received until buyer confirms that they have sent it.\n\nDon’t forget to do this!\n\n## = Leave the \"reason for payment\" field empty\n=\n\nSome payments offer a way to specify a reason for payment (some payment methods call it \"Message\" or \"Information for recipient\" or similar). **Leave this field BLANK.** Do not put the trade ID, any mentions of \"Bisq\" or \"Bitcoin\" or \"crypto\", or any other text whatsoever.\n\nIf you are required to fill in a reason, use your account name eg \"Joe Bloggs\" alternatively enter something non-descriptive like a dash \"-\". If you would prefer to use other text please agree this with your peer in trader chat. Please remember your peer is not obligated to agree anything and may not want to agree to anything other than leaving the description blank, your name or a dash.\n\nViolating this rule will likely result in a trade penalty.\n\nMany banks don’t like anything related to Bitcoin, and may take draconian measures if they sense such a transaction.\n\nMany users trade from personal accounts and may object to using anything that looks like it could be a commercial transaction.\n\n## = Pay any transaction fees\n=\n\nAny fees incurred to make the payment via the agreed payment method (e.g., bank fees for bank transfer, money-order fees for money orders, etc) are the buyer’s responsibility to pay.\n\nThe seller should receive the exact amount of the trade. The only exception to this rule is if the receiving institution imposes a fee on incoming payments—these fees are borne by the seller.\n\n= What happens when things go wrong? =\n\nSometimes trades do not go to plan for whatever reason.\n\nIt is prudent for all traders to know when entering into the trade what will happen when things go wrong. Traders would be wise to make themselves aware of the dispute resolution process to ensure there are no surprises.", "category": "bisq1"}

You should send payment immediately and confirm you have done so in Bisq by clicking 'payment started'.\n\nIf you have the option to include a payment reference please leave it blank. If your bank requires one, please just use your name that matches your bank account.\n\nOnce the BTC Seller receives your payment they will confirm in Bisq and your security deposit and your purchased trade amount will be available in your wallet.\n\n## How do I sell BTC with my UPI account?\n\nYou can sell BTC with UPI on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer to sell BTC on the UPI market.\n# Take an offer to sell BTC on the UPI market.\n\nWhen the offer is confirmed Bisq will provide with the BTC Buyer with your UPI details for you to complete the payment.

{"title": "US Postal Money Order", "content": "**US Postal Money Orders** (USPMO) are one of the most private payment methods on Bisq, currently only available for use on Bisq within the United States.\n\nThis article covers tips and tricks on using this payment method for buying and selling bitcoin on Bisq.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Setting up a payment account in Bisq =\n\nTo buy and sell bitcoin using US Postal Money orders, you will need to set up a corresponding payment account in Bisq.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n* It is okay to use a fake name and address in a USPMO account on Bisq **only if using the account will be used to ''buy'' bitcoin**. This is because a USPMO is a bearer instrument—as long as the money order itself is valid, it doesn't matter who sent it or what the sender's address is.\n** Consider using an online name generator (search \"random name generator\" on your favorite search engine) for a more bias-free suggestion for the sender's name.\n** For the sender's address, you may want to be more careful, because if your envelope is returned, you'll want to be able to retrieve it.\n*** **Option 1** - Use an actual fake address (search internet for \"random address generator\"). If your envelope is returned for any reason, you'll probably lose it for good.\n*** **Option 2** - Use another address: that of a neighbor, a friend, or a nearby building (e.g., apartment leasing office, local mom-and-pop shop, etc). This way, you'll have a higher chance of retrieving a returned envelope, but you'll reveal a bit of information about your location.\n* If selling, name and address must be correct (address must be correct in order to receive the envelope, and name must match photo ID to cash it).\n* To maximize privacy, consider setting up 2 separate payment accounts: one with fake information for buying bitcoin and one with real information for selling bitcoin.\n\nAgain, please note that incorrect information in Bisq payment accounts is generally against Bisq trade protocol. Buying bitcoin with USPMO is a rare exception.\n\n= Buying the money order =\n\nIt is highly recommended to use cash to buy the USPMO. Using any other electronic form of payment adds a form of tracking to the transaction, which can defeat the purpose of using the USPMO in the first place.\n\nIf you're not buying more than $3,000 of money orders in a single day, the [https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/509.htm#ep1124357 USPS does not require photo ID]. If asked for ID, kindly remind your cashier that ID isn't required (perhaps you left it at home?).\n\nAlso consider:\n* asking for a printed receipt, in case of a dispute on Bisq\n* wearing sunglasses and/or a mask\n* placing the USPMO out of sight upon receiving it, and filling it out elsewhere (away from cameras)\n\n= Sending a money order in the mail =\n\n400px|thumb|right|Figure 1. Extra paper for extra privacy in the envelope.\n\nAddress the envelope as appropriate.\n\nWhen putting the money order in the envelope, consider adding a blank sheet of paper for an additional layer of privacy. Fold a blank sheet of paper in half twice (to form a “V” shape). Place the folded sheet in the envelope with the opening facing up. In between the “V” opening, place the USPMO (see Figure 1). This extra layer of paper makes it harder to see the envelope's contents from the outside.\n\nAfter dropping your money order in the mail, don't forget to mark your payment as sent in Bisq!\n\n= Redeeming a money order =\n\n## For cash\n\nIn order to redeem a money order for cash, you'll need to present photo identification that matches the name on the USPMO.\n\nKeep in mind that the cash you can receive may be limited to the amount of cash the cashier has in their drawer—to receive larger quantities of cash, you may need to go to different locations or go back at different times.\n\nOne user has reported a workaround involving spreading the transaction to other counters at the post office:\n\nThe first time I visited the Post Office to \"cash out\" my money order someone sent me in Bisq, I think it was for the amount of $1,000 USD. The Teller told me she doesn't have that much money to help me redeem it. But then, instead of sending me away to my bank to deposit it there, she called out to her co-workers down the line, asking each of them how much each currently had in their drawer. Whereas she had (I forget the exact amounts now) maybe $200 in her drawer, the neighboring teller said she had $300 and the next Teller over said he had about $700. So, my Teller took my $1,000 money order, gave me the $200 in her drawer, printed me a new money order for the difference of $800, and sent me to see the next Teller. Then, that 2nd Teller accepted my $800 money order, gave me her $300 in her drawer, and printed me the difference of $500 as a new money order. Finally, the 3rd Teller used the $700 in his drawer to fully redeem my $500 money order. I had to hop three Tellers, one after another, paying the fee for each money order printed along the way, but I walked out of the Post Office with $1,000 cash in that one visit.\n\n## For new USPMOs\n\nAnother option is to redeem the USPMO you receive for another USPMO. Some cashiers will claim this isn't possible, but it is. Gently call a manager or colleague to help in case your cashier doesn't cooperate.\n\nWhy redeem a USPMO for another USPMO? Because a USPMO is almost as good as cash—you can mail USPMO to billers to pay bills (without banks!), for example.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Wallet", "content": "As many other apps in the Bitcoin space, Bisq has a wallet embedded in it. It is not required in order to use Bisq, but it makes trading easier. This article explains the differences between the Bisq wallet and a generic wallet and answers a few common wallet-related questions.\n\nSee backing up your wallet seed if you haven't already backed up your Bisq wallet.\n\n## What is a wallet?\n\nIn simple words a wallet is a piece of software that helps you manage private keys, public keys, and thus generate addresses, generate and sign transactions and keep track of the funds that belong to the private keys mentioned above by scanning the blockchain.\n\nMost wallets do just that and have a few advanced options on how to generate a transaction as, for example, a SegWit transaction does not have the exact same structure as a non-segwit transaction, a segwit-compatibility transaction and a multsig transaction, for example.\n\n## The Bisq Wallet\n\nThe Bisq wallet is particularly different than others because it allows you to interact with yet another type of transaction: a Bisq trading protocol transaction.\n\nBisq's trading protocol happens (today) all on-chain, which means it uses the Bitcoin blockchain to perform it's logic (which is very thin and simply logic).\n\nJust to have an idea, the transactions that are markedly different because they originate from a Bisq trade are:\n\n* The Maker fee transaction\n\n* The Taker fee transaction\n\n* The multisig transaction (which happens when an offer is taken from the Bisq order book)\n\nThe purpose here is not to detail how these transactions work or are structured, if you want to go deeper in this topic, look at this article about the anatomy of a bisq trade.\n\n## Understanding the Bisq Wallet\n\nIf you navigate to the tab called Funds in the Bisq wallet you will notice that you have 3 states for your balance:\n\n* Available - normal balance that you can use to send BTC to any other address at will\n* Reserved - balance that is under your full control, but that was marked as not spendable by the wallet (for your convenience, so for example, you don't start a sell trade and transfer all the funds out, which would cause you to pay more mining fees to fulfill what you initially intended)\n* Locked - This is outside of your full control. It can relate to balance that you have locked in a trade either because you're selling that BTC or because it is related to the security deposit (which in most cases will simply go back to your wallet after the trade is done)\n\n\n\nWatch keys can be used to see balance from an external wallet.\n\n## SPV file\n\nMost mobile wallets and in-application wallets are what is called a SPV wallet (Simple Payment Verification). Bisq is no different, for most cases.\n\nIf you have a full node in the local network, Bisq will try to connect through it to scan the blockchain and to validate and broadcast that Bisq related transactions. The downside here is that you need to always be connected and on the tip of the blockchain for Bisq to work properly.\n\nFor all other cases, where there is no full node in the machine, Bisq will run in SPV mode. That means it will ping other Full nodes in the network to derive its state and store it in this SPV file that we mention so often.\n\nBecause Bisq uses the Bitcoin Timechain/blockchain to determine the state of trades this file is especially important for your local instance of Bisq to run smoothly. See more here\n\n## Important\n\nAvoid using Bisq’s seeds in other Bitcoin wallets. Not all wallets support the handling of Bisq’s multisig as well as the BSQ token itself, which is based on Bitcoin UTXOs. By using your seed in other wallets you risk:\n* Messing with your own trades in Bisq - Exactly because bisq labels transactions internally (not something a lot of wallets do) it can get your open offers/trades into unexpected states.\n* Burning your BSQ balance - BSQ is colored Bitcoin, which means the token uses Bitcoin UTXOs to “move” around. If you spend these UTXOs for their Satoshi nominal values, you may encounter problems with your BSQ.\n\nCategory:Features", "category": "bisq1"}

It’s needed to have a Capitual account to redeem a CapCode.\n\nAfter generating a CapCode, the amount gets “locked in”, and is already deducted from your balance.

{"title": "Cloning an offer", "content": "'''Cloning an offer'' is a feature added in Bisq v1.9.11.\n\nCloning an offer allows offer makers to use the same security deposit for multiple offers.\n\n## What is this difference between duplicating and offer and cloning an offer?\n\nDuplicating an offer creates a new transaction. Therefore, each duplicated offer has a cost in terns of a new mining and trade fee for the on-chain transaction.\n\nCloning an offer uses the original deposit transaction of the cloned offer to create a new offer that shares the original deposit transaction, therefore, no additional on chain transaction or fees are needed.\n\n## What are the advantages of cloning an offer?\n\nThe advantages of cloning an offer are the ability to create more offers for different payment methods and/or different currencies increasing the likelihood that someone will take your offer.\n\nFor example if you are in the US and happy to accept payment by ACH, Strike, Wire, or Zelle, you could clone your offer to show all 4 of these payment methods without paying to create an additional offer. This will result in 4 offers been shown in the Bisq offer book and increase the chance that your offer is taken quickly.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of cloning an offer?\n\nThe disadvantages of cloning an offer is that once your cloned offer is taken all associated clones (those that share the same deposit transaction fee) will disappear from the Bisq offer book.\n\n## What offers can be cloned?\n\nAny maker offer can be cloned, excluding BSQ swaps.\n\nClones MUST be for a different payment method and/or currency.\n\nFor example you cannot create 5 Zelle clones (as these would all be for USD and Zell)\n\nYou could however create 5 Revolut clones for USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, CAD (as these would be for the same payment method but importantly 5 different currencies).\n\nYou could also create multiple clones of the same currency offers provding you use different payment methods for example a EUR trade for; SEPA, SEPA Instant, TransferWise, Revolut.\n\n## How do I clone an offer?\n\nThere are two ways to clone an offer:\n\n* Right click the offer in 'Open Offer' and click clone offer.\n* Go to open offers and press the square clone icon on the right the offer.\n\n## How do I see which of my offers are cloned?\n\nCloned offers share the same maker fee. You can see what maker fees each of your offer have in 'Open Offers' under the 'Maker fee' column.\n\n## How do I edit a cloned offer?\n\nYou can edit a cloned offer just like any other offer. click the pencil icon next to the offer in 'Open Offers'\n\nNB: Cloned offers share the BTC same amount, and must have different payment methods and/or currencies used for them. You will see a warning message if you try and change anything that cannot be changed.\n\n## How many times can I clone an offer?\n\nYou can clone an offer 10 times. You will get an error message if you try and clone an offer more than 10 times.\n\nYou can however have multiple offers and clone them each up to 10 times.\n\n## What happens when my clone offer is taken?\n\nWhen your cloned offer is taken you will see it in your 'Open Trades' the same as if any of your other offers were taken.\n\nThe clones of the offer sharing the same maker fee will then disappear from your 'Open Offers' and the Bisq offer book.\n\n## Is there a way to create the same cloned offers again quickly?\n\nNot currently, for now you will need to re-add your cloned offers manually.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Create a new wallet for your data directory", "content": "When you just need a fresh new wallet, but wish to keep everything else (accounts, signing status, onion address, trade history, notifications app association, and other custom settings), it is easier and faster to only generate a new wallet for Bisq, rather than switching to a new data directory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Why creating a new wallet? =\n\nBeing a project built in Java, Bisq uses [https://bitcoinj.org/ bitcoinj], which is a Java library to manage a bitcoin wallet, among other things. This comes with some known limitations, among which is the heavy performance hit when the wallet is old, and contains many transactions, this being especially aggravating when a user needs to do a SPV resync, as it will take a significant amount of time during which the PC will suffer from high load. With old-time and very active traders, who have many past transactions built up in their wallet, this is even more at risk of happening, and causes a forced interruption in trading, as SPV resync must be completed before the application can resume its operativity.\n\nRecreating a completely new Bisq wallet will eliminate the issue, at least for the near future (running your personal Bitcoin node also helps a lot with stability), at the same time preserving all the accrued reputation of your payment accounts, your full trading history, and your existing onion address, by which your previous trading peers will be able to recognize you.\n\n= Preparations =\n\nMake sure the following checklist is observed:\n* No existing open offers (delete them -this will make you lose the fees- or wait until they are taken, and their respective trades are completed).\n* No existing open trades (wait until they are completed).\n* No existing disputes (wait until their resolution).\n* Consistent wallet state (go to Funds > Send Funds, and for each btc address containing funds, verify its balance actually exists by searching the address on [https://mempool.space mempool.space], otherwise do a SPV resync and repeat).\n\n= Caveats =\n\nThe provided instructions are safe as long as you don't make mistakes, which could amount to:\n\n* Deleting a folder instead of renaming it.\n* Using a wrong address to send funds to.\nThe above mistakes can easily lead to loss of funds, which we obviously are not liable for.\n\n= Instructions =\n\nIf the above requirements are met, and you understood the caveats, assuming you have BTC (and probably BSQ as well) in your old wallet, you can follow the procedure outlined below:\n\n# Close Bisq.\n# Rename the data directory from Bisq to Bisq.old. Copy this file to an external device, it will be used as a backup in case of data loss.\n# Start Bisq.\n# A new Bisq instance called Bisq will be created (including a new wallet, which is the one we will soon be using to replace the old one).\n# Go to ''Account'' > ''Wallet seed'' and write down the seed of the new wallet. Set the password for the wallet at ''Account'' > ''Wallet password''.\n# Go to ''Funds'' > ''Receive Funds'' and copy the first btc receive address, pasting it into a separate text file for later use.\n# Go to ''DAO'' > ''BSQ Wallet'' > ''Receive'' and copy the BSQ receive address of the new wallet, pasting it into your notes.\n# Close Bisq.\n# Rename the newly created data directory, from Bisq to Bisq.new, and rename the previous directory from Bisq.old to Bisq.\n# Start Bisq\n# You will be back into your old Bisq instance\n# Go to ''DAO'' > ''BSQ Wallet'' > ''Send'' and send all your BSQ balance to the BSQ receive address of the new wallet (this needs to be done first! if you moved out all of your BTC now, there would be none left to pay for the mining fees to move the BSQ!)\n# Go to ''Funds'' > ''Send Funds'' and move all your BTC balance to the BTC receive address of the new wallet.\n# Close Bisq\n# Within the data directory, navigate to the contents of btc_mainnet and rename the wallet folder to wallet.old.\n# Copy the wallet folder from the same location in Bisq.new, into the btc_mainnet folder of the \"old\" data directory, so that now there will be wallet and wallet.old folders under btc_mainnet.\n# Start Bisq, wait until wallet is synchronized with the blockchain, and verify that all your funds were correctly moved, checking the contents of ''Funds'' > ''Send Funds'', and ''DAO'' > ''BSQ Wallet''.\n# You can now operate normally with Bisq. The brand new wallet will be used instead of the old one.\n\n= Create a new wallet when the old one is empty =\n\nIf you wish to switch to a brand new wallet, and there are no funds (anymore) in the previous one, the procedure is much simpler:\n# Close Bisq.\n# Navigate to your data directory and into the btc_mainnet folder.\n# Rename the wallet folder to wallet.old.\n# Start Bisq, notice a new wallet was created, write down the new seed and set the password.\n\n= Disaster recovery =\n\nIn case you made some mistakes along the way and things don't work as they should, and provided you never deleted anything, but rather renamed the folders as suggested above, you can go back to the starting point by simply making sure, after closing Bisq, that the data directory gets back to its original state, that is, Bisq.old is renamed to Bisq, and, if you got to that point, wallet.old to wallet.\n\nHaving a copy of wallet.old at an external device (like a usb memory) is also recommended, in case of the unlikely event of permanent data loss.\n\n= Cleanup =\n\nOnly after you are absolutely sure everything is in order, and if you need to free up as much disk space as possible, you can delete the Bisq.new and wallet.old folders.", "category": "general"}

You should then proceed to put together a pull request that fixes the bug as per the usual Development Process.\n\nOnce assigned to a critical bug, you should post comments on the issue indicating your progress and post standup updates about it each day you work on it. This allows other developers to help out if need be and keeps everyone in the loop.

{"title": "How to be a market maker on Bisq", "content": "Markets need liquidity to be useful. A **market maker** provides liquidity by creating offers and earns a profit for this very useful service. By publishing offers on Bisq, a market maker makes sure that when other traders come to market to buy or sell, they always have an option to do so immediately.\n\nSome markets on Bisq have few or no offers available. This means that new users see that market empty, they are discouraged and leave without trading. A market maker can bridge that coordination gap, helping kickstart a new market, while at the same time earning some Bitcoin.\n\nHere's a simple way to perform the market maker function:\n\n1. Find a market with few or no offers available.\n\n2. Create an offer to BUY Bitcoin at 3% below market price. (For example see How to create an offer to buy BTC with EUR)\n\n3. Create an offer to SELL Bitcoin at 3% above market price. (For example see How to create an offer to sell BTC with EUR)\n\n4. Stay online and keep Bisq running so that your offers are available.\n\n5. When one of your offers is taken, complete the trade and create a new one to replace it.\n\n6. Tell people about it! Let people from that market know that you are trying to kickstart it.\n\nIn the example above if both your offers are taken you will have sold at 103 and bought at 97, making a profit of 6. You will also be performing a very valuable service for other Bisq users who don't have the time to stay online and just want to be able to take an offer quickly. Offer takers will be happy to pay a small % for the convenience of buying or selling when they want. Some markets are less liquid and you can charge more for your service, others have many more offers and will pay less for the convenience.\n\n*For more short guides see Howto.

{"title": "Installing your own Bitcoin node", "content": "It is best practice that any Bitcoin user installs his own node, to send and verify his own transactions; moreover, if you use Bisq consistently, you are strongly encouraged to do so, as it will make the bitcoin network connection much more stable, and especially reduce the risk of needing SPV resync on a wallet that contains many transactions. Even when a SPV resync is needed, it will be much painless if done while connected to your own node.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Hardware requirements =\n\nThe most demanding part of a full Bitcoin node is disk space: 1TB is considered the bare minimum (2TB is better for future proofing your node), and a SSD is recommended, as the constant write operations would risk damaging the average mechanical disk. There are pruned nodes that will only keep the very last blocks of the blockchain in order to save on disk space, but as Bisq needs a fully verifying node, we will only be examining this case in the present guide.\n\nThe following are viable hardware options to host the node:\n* refurbished laptop with at least 8GB of RAM\n** pros: comes with display, keyboard, and basic storage (existing storage will need to be replaced or expanded), can run multiple services and act as a full fledged home server, has builtin UPS\n** cons: drains more power and is more expensive than a Raspberry Pi 3, takes up more space on your shelf\n* dedicated Raspberry Pi 3\n** pros: very small, low power, completely silent\n** cons: no builtin display, keyboard nor storage, very low performance, needs more initial maintenance\n* your daily driver machine\n** pros: no need to source additional hardware (except the additional storage if it's not enough), will likely not suffer from the limited additional overhead of a Bitcoin node while you use it normally\n** cons: you either have to leave it always running, to keep updated with blocks as soon as they are mined, or will have to wait a variable amount of time for it to catch up to the current block height each time you turn it on, before you can use Bisq\n\n= Installing the software =\n\nWhen installing the Bitcoin node software, you will be either working on a graphical user interface, or on a system that only operates via command line (most likely the Raspberry).\n\n## Systems with graphical interface\n\nUnless you want to install a leaner daemon setup and follow the command-line steps below, installing directly on a graphical interface is the easier path, as you can download and verify the files as per the instructions on https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ and then install the software as you normally would on your operating system, making sure you point it to the 1TB drive to save the blockchain.\n\n## Systems with command line interface\n\nYou may choose to run a dedicated refurbished laptop on Linux and without a desktop environment, and it would be a wise choice; regarding a Raspberry, while you could install a graphical desktop environment on a Pi 3, it is absolutely not recommended to do so, because it will be a self-contained system that will only cater to the task of running the node software, and any additional load, like keeping the graphical interface in memory, will degrade its performance.\n\nThere is a well known step-by-step guide that will illustrate how to install a full Bitcoin Node on a Raspberry, called the [https://raspibolt.org/ RaspiBolt Guide], plus its amd64/desktop counterpart, directed at laptops/PCs, called [https://minibolt.info MiniBolt]. They both include a section dedicated to installing software for a Lightning Network node, but you will only need to follow the guide for your system up to the configuration of the Bitcoin client.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThere have been multiple reports about the Ronin node package not allowing Bisq to connect (after the first time), and we know no tested solution for this issue, so it is recommended using the steps above to obtain the Bitcoin node software.\n\n## Common steps\n\nNo matter the path you chose above, you will have to wait a considerable amount of time after installing the node.\n\nThe initial block download will have your Bitcoin client fetch from the p2p network, and verify one by one, all the blocks since the genesis, which at the time of writing amounts to 570GB of data, so expect from 2 to 10 days of uninterrupted CPU and network activity, depending on the connection (whether clearnet or Tor) and the performance of the hardware (a faster machine will complete the block verification and writing to disk in less time)\n\n= Setup the node to accept connections from Bisq =\n\nFor the bitcoin connection on Bisq to be effective, you will need to make sure the node's configuration is correct.\nIf you installed the client via command line interface following the guides linked above, you will probably have a working config file already, but in case you installed the GUI client, you will have to manually edit the bitcoin.conf file from within the settings, and make sure it contains the following:\n\nserver=1\nprune=0\npeerbloomfilters=1\n\nwhich in turn:\n* enable the block server mode\n* disable the pruning of old blocks\n* allow Bisq to run SPV queries on the node\n\nIf the node is running on a separate machine, but on the same local network, it needs to listen for connections from external clients as well, and the easiest way of doing this is to add the following to the config file:\n\nbind=0.0.0.0\n\nNo need for the above if the node runs on a different network, and you will connect to it via Tor.\n\nAfter any change to the bitcoin.conf file, the bitcoin client needs to be restarted.\n\nIf, on the same remote machine running the node, you installed ufw as the Bolt guides suggest, you have to allow incoming connections on port 8333 (edit the local network base address as needed):\n\nsudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/24 to any port 8333 comment 'Bitcoin p2p'\n\n= Setup the connection from Bisq to the node =\n\nThe following will change depending on where the node is located respectively to Bisq.\n\n## Connecting to a node on the same PC\n\nIf the Bitcoin node is installed on the same machine as Bisq, the latter will automatically connect to it without the need to edit anything. Considering how Bisq will only run on amd64 architecture, you can achieve this with either your daily driver, or a dedicated laptop/desktop through direct or remote access (for example via xpra).\n\nMake sure no other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) are running while starting Bisq.\n\n## Connecting to a Bitcoin node on the same local network\n\nAfter setting the config file to accept connections from external machines, as explained above, you will have to setup Bisq to connect to the remote node. This should be achieved by launching Bisq with the following command-line parameters (as an example, the node on the local network is at 10.0.0.21, edit the command to match your situation):\n\nBisq -btcNodes=10.0.0.21:8333 -useTorForBtc=false\n\nOnce Bisq has started, you should verify under Settings > Network, that these settings are replicated, in particular you should see that the node's IP:port is filled in the address field, and the \"Use Tor for Bitcoin Network\" checkbox is disabled.\n\n## Connecting to a remote node through the Tor Network\n\nIf you installed the node software on a machine that is geographically separate from your local network, and you followed the Bolt guides, it will be already connecting to the internet through Tor, so you can point Bisq to its onion address.\n\nOn the node's machine's shell, run\n\nbitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion\n\nto obtain your onion address, copy it to the clipboard and paste it in Bisq under Settings > Network > Use Custom Bitcoin Core nodes\n\nBisq will offer to restart, thus connecting to the custom remote node.\n\n= Verify the connection =\n\nOnce you connect to your own node, Bisq will show Bitcoin network peers: 1 in the bottom right corner, and under Settings > Network you will notice the node is the only one listed under \"Bitcoin network\".\n\n= Troubleshooting =\n\nIf you get into a state where Bisq is unable to connect, you can revert to a provided node as follows.\n\nFor MacOS:\nBisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true\n\nFor Linux:\n\n/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true\n\nFor Windows:\n\nC:\\Users\\your-username-here\\AppData\\Local\\Bisq\\Bisq.exe -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true\n\nContributor nodes can be seen [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/7c07cdb6ff60ad1186dea33acdfb688668c2aae6/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/btc/nodes/BtcNodes.java#L51-L76 in the Bisq code].\n\nMore info on running from the command line.\n\nMore info on command line options.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Mining fees", "content": "**Mining fees** are BTC paid to miners to include a BTC transaction into a block.\nThe amount of BTC to be paid depends on a mining fee market driven by the amount of blocks produced by miners and demand for block space, and also the size of the transaction. This price is expressed in sat/vB or satoshis per byte. BTC transactions waiting to be included into a BTC block wait at the mempools of BTC nodes, and only those offering a higher sats/vB to miners will be included for every block. Mempool state can be seen at most blockchain explorers, like [http://www.mempool.space mempool.space].\nBisq use segwit addresses by default to save space on the blockchain and hence, mining fees.\n\n500px|thumb|left\n\n## = Mining fees to trade\n=\nRequired mining fees for trading are estimated by Bisq. Traders can't decide how much to pay because underpaying mining fees would cause delays or even make trades fail. Fee rate to be used is fed by seednodes and displayed at the bottom left of the window.\nThe total BTC to be paid is displayed before making or taking any offer. As makers only publish a single transaction to create an offer (maker trading fee transaction) and takers have to publish three (taker trading fee, deposit and payout transactions), taking an offer pays approximately 3 times more in mining fees than making an offer. This is because offer makers cannot know what mining fees will be at the time their offer is taken.\nUnlike trading fees, mining fees to pay are independent to the trade amount.

{"title": "Mobile notifications", "content": "A full Bisq mobile app doesn't exist yet, but you can get **mobile notifications** from Bisq while it runs on your computer.\n\nThe mobile notifications app currently works on iOS and Android devices with Google Play Services; only for Android platform, the latest APK can also be downloaded from the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisqremote_Android/releases github repository].\n\n**Foreword about current state of mobile app**ː currently, the mobile app will be able to pair with desktop (only through token), but it won't show a feedback about the pairing being successful; the app will also show an event in notification area, when one of the trigger events selected on desktop will happen, but the details of such event won't be visible on mobile, and clicking the event in notification area will bring back to the pairing screen; it is needed to open the desktop app to verify what event triggered the notification.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Get the app\n\nMobile app links:\n* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joachimneumann.bisq Google Play Store] (Android) ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisqremote_Android Source])\n* [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bisq-mobile/id1424420411 Apple App Store] (iOS) ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisqremote_iOS Source])\n\n## Pair the mobile app with desktop Bisq\n\nYou will need to send the pairing token generated by the mobile app to desktop Bisq. To do this, you can either use your computer's webcam to scan a QR code shown on your phone, or send the pairing token text manually from the mobile app to your desktop and paste it into Bisq yourself.\n\nTo generate the pairing token, click Pair in the mobile app.\n\nIf you'd like to use your desktop computer's webcam, go to Account > Notifications, click Scan QR Code, and scan the QR code shown in the mobile app.\n\nIf not, securely send the text of the pairing token to yourself and click I don't have a webcam in desktop Bisq. The apps may mention something about email, but you can send the pairing key using any method you prefer.\n\nWhen pairing completes, you’ll see a success message in Bisq desktop.\n\n## Configure notifications\n\nThere are three types of notifications you can get: trade alerts, offer alerts, and price alerts. You can also enable and disable notification sounds.\n\n## = Trade alerts\n=\n\nThese alerts will notify you whenever:\n* your action is needed on any open trades\n* one of your offers is taken\n* you've received a new dispute message\n\nTo enable trade alerts, simply check the Receive trade messages.\n\n**Note that dispute alerts do not include any message content**—they merely let you know a new dispute message has been received on your desktop Bisq app.\n\nHere’s how trade alerts can be useful:\n\nExample 1: you’re buying BTC, just sent your deposit, and are waiting for the transaction to hit 1 blockchain confirmation so you can send payment. That can take approximately 10 minutes. Instead of waiting at your screen, you can go have a coffee and let your phone alert you when it’s time to send the fiat currency or altcoin payment.\n\nExample 2: you’re selling BTC, and you’re waiting for your trading partner to send you fiat currency or altcoin payment. It might take them minutes or hours. Instead of repeatedly checking your desktop Bisq app for updates, your mobile device will simply push an alert as soon as your trading partner marks their payment as sent, so you can then check for the payment and promptly complete the trade.\n\n## = Offer alerts\n=\n\nThese alerts will notify you whenever there’s a new offer that fits your criteria.\n\nTo set your criteria:\n\n# Select your preferred payment account.\n# Select which offers you want to receive alerts for: buy or sell. If you want to buy bitcoin, you’ll want to know when someone’s made a good sell offer (and vice-versa if you want to sell bitcoin).\n# Determine the % distance from the market price for which you want to get a notification. With a price distance set, you will only receive an alert when an offer that meets (or exceeds) your requirements is published. Example: you want to sell BTC, but you will only sell at a 2% premium to the current market price. Setting this field to 2% will ensure you only receive alerts for offers with prices that are 2% (or more) above the current market price.\n# Hit Add offer alert.\n\nClicking Manage offer alerts shows you a screen with all configured alerts. There, you can remove offer alerts you no longer need.\n\n## = Price alerts\n=\n\nThese alerts will notify you whenever bitcoin hits the specified price in the specified currency.\n\nFirst, select your currency. Then, choose the upper and lower price thresholds. You’ll get an alert when the bitcoin price goes above your upper threshold, or when it goes below your lower threshold.\n\nExample: an alert set with an upper threshold of 6000 EUR and lower threshold of 5500 EUR will send you a notification when the market price goes over 6000 or when it goes below 5500 EUR.\n\n## Technical details & privacy\n\n600px|thumb|left|Bisq mobile notification architecture.\n\nNotifications are sent from the Bisq desktop app to the Bisq relay node which acts as proxy to the Apple/Google push notification services.\n\n## = Pairing\n=\n\nBefore allowing the mobile app to start the pairing to the Bisq desktop app, the mobile App registers with the Apple or Google notification service and receives a notification token. This happens in the background without any user interaction. Next, a byte cryptographic key for symmetric encryption is generated in the phone and the pairing token is assembled.\n\nThe pairing token consists of four parts which are separated by the \"|\" character:\n\n* A Magic, currently either iOS, iOSDev or android.\n* A Phone descriptor, e.g., iPhone6.\n* A 32-byte cryptographic key for symmetric encryption. This key is generated by the phone and used in the Bisq desktop app to encrypt the content of the notification.\n* A device token, either from Apple or from Google.\n\nThe pairing token is then transferred from the phone to Bisq desktop by QR code (using the desktop computers' webcam) or manually by the user (e.g., sending the string through a secure messaging app, email, etc).\n\n## = Sending a notification\n=\n\nThe Bisq desktop app knows the device token (from Apple or Google) and it has the encryption key from the phone. The notification itself is a json string containing the type of notification and its content. After encrypting the notification the desktop app sends it along with the device token to a Bisq relay node over Tor. Because of Tor, the relay node does not know the IP address of the computer on which you run your Bisq desktop app. The relay node forwards the notification to an Apple/Google push notification server (over https), which then pushes a notification to your mobile device using the provided device token.\n\n## = Privacy\n=\n\nUltimately, Apple/Google know that a device with your device token is receiving Bisq notifications. Note that they already knew you are likely to be a Bisq user when you download the Bisq mobile app. However, neither Google nor Apple can see the content of the notification. This is also the reason why OS pop-ups that notify you cannot contain any notification specific content.\n\nCurrently, the relay node does not store any data (notifications, device tokens, etc).\n\nWe feel that Push notifications can’t be implemented in a more private way. If there is any aspect of this mobile notifications mechanism, feel free to contact us. Of course, the notification mechanism is optional and does in no way limit the functionality of the Bisq desktop app.\n\n## More information\n\nSee the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisqremote/wiki/Specification wiki on GitHub] for more details.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Payment account age witness", "content": "**Payment account age witness** is a mechanism to protect against bank fraud when doing fiat transactions with strangers on the internet.\n\nPayment account aging worked well for about 2 years until it was significantly improved in v1.5 with account signing.\n\n''This article is adapted from [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-docs/blob/master/payment-account-age-witness.adoc a document] originally hosted on the old documentation website (https://docs.bisq.network). It was written by Manfred Karrer and originally published on 14 September 2017.''\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Problem\n\nBecause bank transfers can be canceled and bitcoin transactions cannot be canceled, buying bitcoin with a stolen bank account is an attractive proposition for criminals. If a criminal does manage to buy bitcoin with Bisq using a stolen bank account, the rightful owner of the stolen bank account will probably discover the fraud and immediately cancel the payment (i.e., initiate a chargeback). Unfortunately, the bitcoin seller will have already unlocked their deposit and will lose the fiat payment they received.\n\nPayment account aging seeks to make it less practical for a criminal to cash out a stolen bank account in this way.\n\nThe account aging protection mechanism described in this article assumes the following:\n* a criminal will want to withdraw funds from a stolen account as quickly as possible\n* a criminal would prefer to do a few large transactions instead of many small transactions (because with each transaction, risk of the fraud being discovered goes higher)\n\nWith trade size limits in Bisq, there already is some protection against this fraud scheme, but it would be even better to increase security even more by adding a verification scheme for the age of the payment account within Bisq.\n\nTo protect user privacy we use a hashing scheme. Only the other trading peer (who gets the other peer's payment account data anyway, so they can make the payment) can verify that the hash provided in the offer matches the peer's payment account hash.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe initial idea for this scheme was already discussed on the Bisq forum ([https://forum.bisq.io/t/new-requirement-for-payment-accounts-with-chargeback-risk/2376/65 one], [https://forum.bisq.io/t/payment-account-age-based-trade-amount-limits/2948 two]).\n\nThis mechanism is only relevant for fiat payment accounts, because with altcoins, there is no chargeback risk.\n\nWe posit that a 60-day-old payment account should be safe (it seems highly unlikely that a stolen bank account will not get discovered for such a long time). **This is the core premise of account aging**: from the time a user sets up a payment account in Bisq, until 60 days later, Bisq limits the size of trades handled by that payment account.\n\nCheating this mechanism would be difficult because a scammer cannot know a stolen account's information before stealing the account.\n\nConsequently, we use following trade limits:\n\n* Account age is 0-30 days: 25% of the payment method's maximum (e.g. 0.125 BTC if maximum is 0.5 BTC)\n* Account age is 30-60 days: 50% of the payment method's maximum (e.g. 0.25 BTC if maximum is 0.5 BTC)\n* Account age is 60+ days: 100% of the payment method's maximum (e.g. 0.50 BTC if maximum is 0.50 BTC)\n\n''Please note that the numbers above are for illustration purposes only; trade size limits will fluctuate based on BTC market price. See trade limits for a listing of payment methods and their maximum allowed trade sizes.''\n\n## AccountAgeWitness\n\nWhen a user sets up a fiat payment account (e.g. SEPA, Zelle, etc​) in Bisq, he publishes an AccountAgeWitness data object to the P2P network.\n\n## = AccountAgeWitness data object\n=\n\nThe AccountAgeWitness object contains a hash and the date of publishing.\n\n// Ripemd160(Sha256(ageWitnessInputData, salt and pubKey)) - 20 bytes\nprivate final byte[] hash;\n// 8 bytes\nprivate final long date;\n\nThe hash is created with Sha256 and wrapped into a Ripemd160 hash to get a 20 byte hash instead of 32 bytes as it would be with Sha256. Input for the hash is a concatenation of the ageWitnessInputData (e.g. IBAN), a 256 bit salt and the pubKey. The ageWitnessInputData is the smallest set of uniquely identifying payment account data (e.g. concatenated IBAN and BIC). We don’t use the complete payment account data because we don’t want to break an existing ageWitness by minor changes like changing the holder name (e.g. adding middle name). The public key is used in the verification process to check the signature which will get passed in the trade process. That will assure that the AccountAgeWitness data cannot be used by anyone else (see: Hijacking a foreign AccountAgeWitness). The application wide 1024 bit DSA signing key is used. Signature algorithm is \"SHA256withDSA\".\n\nThe salt value will be locally persisted with the payment account object.\n\nThe date must not be older or newer than 1 day compared to a receiving peer’s local date. If the date is outside of that tolerance range the AccountAgeWitness object will get ignored and not further broadcasted. With that check we protect against back-dating attempts (see: Broadcasting a back-dated AccountAgeWitness object). We allow a rather large tolerance because computer clocks might be out of sync and the relevant periods are rather long (30 or 60 days), so the max. gain from an abuse of that tolerance window of 1 day is negligible.\n\nThis AccountAgeWitness data structure results in 28 bytes per item but as we use Protobuffer there is some overhead added which results in 33 bytes per data item. If we store 1 000 000 AccountAgeWitness objects we would have about 33 MB of data. The data are locally persisted and with every release we ship the latest state in a resource file. That helps that new users don’t need to retrieve all data from the P2P network. We also use a diff when requesting so we only request the missing data from the seed node at startup.\n\nIf the data would become too large, we can consider a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism where AccountAgeWitness objects need to get triggered with a refresh message to stay active. That way outdated objects which have not received any TTL signal since a long period (e.g. 6 months) would get pruned.\n\n// class AccountAgeWitnessService\npublic AccountAgeWitness getMyWitness(PaymentAccountPayload paymentAccountPayload) {\nbyte[] accountInputDataWithSalt = Utilities.concatenateByteArrays(paymentAccountPayload.getAgeWitnessInputData(),\npaymentAccountPayload.getSalt());\nbyte[] hash = Hash.getSha256Ripemd160hash(Utilities.concatenateByteArrays(accountInputDataWithSalt,\nkeyRing.getPubKeyRing().getSignaturePubKeyBytes()));\nlong date = new Date().getTime();\nreturn new AccountAgeWitness(hash, date);\n}\n\n// getAgeWitnessInputData at example class SepaAccount\npublic byte[] getAgeWitnessInputData() {\n// We don't add holderName because we don't want to break age validation if the user recreates an account with\n// slight changes in holder name (e.g. add or remove middle name)\nreturn super.getAgeWitnessInputData(ArrayUtils.addAll(iban.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\")),\nbic.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"))));\n}\n\n// CountryBasedPaymentAccountPayload super class\n@Override\nprotected byte[] getAgeWitnessInputData(byte[] data) {\nreturn super.getAgeWitnessInputData(ArrayUtils.addAll(countryCode.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\")), data));\n}\n\n// PaymentAccountPayload base class\nprotected byte[] getAgeWitnessInputData(byte[] data) {\nreturn ArrayUtils.addAll(paymentMethodId.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\")), data);\n}\n\n// Getting salt from CryptoUtils, called from PaymentAccountPayload constructor with size 32\npublic static byte[] getRandomBytes(int size) {\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[size];\nnew SecureRandom().nextBytes(bytes);\nreturn bytes;\n}\n\n## = AccountAgeWitness propagation\n=\n\nThe user will publish the AccountAgeWitness data when setting up the payment account and re-publish at each startup to ensure higher redundancy. Peers who have the data already will not broadcast it further.\n\nThe AccountAgeWitness data will be distributed in the P2P network and stored locally at each user. At each new release we will ship the actual data set as resource file (e.g. PersistableNetworkPayload_BTC_MAINNET) with the application binary to avoid that new users need to download the complete data set.\n\nWhen a node receives an AccountAgeWitness object it verifies that the tradeDate is not older or newer than 1 day compared with the local time of the node, otherwise it will reject the object. The date check is only done when receiving the data via the P2P network broadcasting, otherwise we could not fill up our initial map received form the seed node with the past distributed AccountAgeWitness objects.\n\nNOTE: There is no date check for the data we receive from seed nodes. This is in the current state not an issue because the seed nodes are bonded with BSQ against abuse but in future improvements we would like to distribute more functions from the seed node to ordinary nodes and then there is a security issue with that.\n\n## = Offer\n=\n\nThe offer maker will add the hash used in the AccountAgeWitness object to his offer. With that hash all users can look up if they have an AccountAgeWitness matching the hash and if so they can evaluate the account age. The account age will be visually displayed in the offerbook. At that stage nobody can verify if the hash is matching the real payment account data. But this is not a problem because the verification will be done once someone takes the offer. A fraudulent offer would cause a failure in the take offer process.\n\n## = Verification\n=\n\nWhen a trader takes an offer both users are exchanging in the trade process the signature of data defined by the other peer (for taker we use the offer ID, for maker we use the takers preparedDepositTx - we use that data like a nonce for the signature), the pubKey, the salt and the peer’s local date. With that data the other peer can verify that the other trader is the owner of the AccountAgeWitness data (as the pubKey is part of the hash and the signature gets verified with pubKey and predefined input data) and that the hash is matching the account data used for the trade. As the date of both users will differ at least slightly we exchange the peer’s local date and use that for calculating the age and trade limit. The date needs to be inside a 1 day tolerance otherwise the trade fails. That way we avoid problems with corner cases when the age just enters the next level for one peer but the verifying peer might get another result because of time differences. Any violation of those rules would lead to a failed trade.\n\nVerification steps:\n# Check if witness date is after release date for that feature (v0.6 or newer)\n# Check if peer’s date is within 1-day tolerance window\n# Verify if witness hash matches hash created from the data delivered by peer (ageWitnessInputData, salt, pubKey)\n# Check if peer’s trade limit calculated with its account age is not lower than the trade amount.\n# Verify if signature of the predefined input data (offer ID or preparedDepositTx) is correct using the peer’s pubKey.\n\nBy using offer ID and preparedDepositTx for the nonce, we avoid the need for a challenge protocol. We have chosen data which are defined by the other peer so they cannot be manipulated.\n\n## Attempts to game the system\n\n## = Broadcasting a back-dated AccountAgeWitness object\n=\n\nWe need to be sure that the date of the trade in the AccountAgeWitness object cannot be back-dated by a malicious trader. To achieve that, any node will ignore AccountAgeWitness objects which are older or newer than 1 day.\n\n## = Hijacking a foreign AccountAgeWitness\n=\n\nA more advanced fraud approach would be an attempt of hijacking someone else’s AccountAgeWitness and payment account to gain the benefit of an already aged account.\n\nA malicious trader could make a trade with someone who has already an old account and takes the account data of that trader to use it for an own account. That fake account can only be used for buying BTC because for selling he would not receive the Fiat money but the user from where he has \"stolen\" the data. Because he has traded with the peer he has received all the relevant data for the verification like the salt and the pubKey. To protect against such a hijacking attempt we use the peer’s signature to verify ownership of the AccountAgeWitness data. Without the private key the fraudster cannot create a correct signature matching the pubKey and input data. The public key is used for the hash in the AccountAgeWitness so he cannot alter that. The signed data is defined by the other peer and different for each trade so he has no chance to use data where he knows already the signature.\n\n## = Changing a foreign AccountAgeWitness\n=\n\nThe AccountAgeWitness data are appended in a data structure which is only protected by checking if the date in the AccountAgeWitness object is not older or newer than 1 day compared to the current date of the local node. Once data is stored there it cannot be altered. It uses the AccountAgeWitness hash as key in a hash map. There is no way to change an already broadcasted AccountAgeWitness object.\n\nOne sophisticated attack could be to alter the date in an AccountAgeWitness to a far future date thus occupying the map entry by the hash and preventing the originator of the data to get propagated his real account age. To prevent that we check that the date is also not **newer** than 1 day. So worst an attacker could do is to fake ones AccountAgeWitness date by 1 day to past or future. That will not have any effects as we use a 1 day tolerance window at the verification.\n\n## = Using an older version of Bisq\n=\n\nAccount aging was implemented in Bisq 0.6, so a user may try to use an older version of Bisq to get around the account aging mechanism. To avoid this, the network will stop supporting offers made with Bisq programs before v0.6 on February 15 2018. There will be a fade-in period for the feature so users have a chance to get their accounts aged to >2 months without hitting trade limits. Offers using payment accounts without an account age witness will be rejected after February, 15, 2018.\n\n## User interface\n\nFrom a user perspective the changes are visible in the create offer screen, take offer screen, the offerbook and the payment account. The trade amount limits are reflected and feedback will be provided if the user tries to take an offer with a higher amount as his account age permits. The user icon in the offerbook will contain a colored ring around the icon representing the account age. The tooltip and the peer info box (opens when clicking the icon) will add textual information about the account age. Offers with a min. trade amount exceeding the users account age based limit are greyed out and on click the user gets a popup displayed with information why he cannot take that offer. The create offer and take offer screens have the trade amount input validators adjusted to reflect the trade limit. In the payment account screen the user can see the age, the limit and the salt.\n\n## = Salt management\n=\n\nIf the user changes his payment account or start over with a new application we need to support that he can re-use the salt he used with a certain bank account. We added an extra field in the payment account setup screen where the user can add a past salt (by default the app generates a random salt).\n\n## Update and migration process\n\nWe don’t want to disrupt the trade experience for existing traders by reducing the trade amount limit to the lowest level when we publish that update. Also existing offers would get rendered invalid.\n\nTo fade in that feature we use a date-based approach.\n\n* Before December, 15, 2017 (about 1.5 months after release) we don’t apply the lower limit based on the account age.\n* After that date and before January, 15, 2018 we only apply a factor of 0.75 to those which are less then 30 days old. Accounts which are 30-60 days old are not affected (no reduction).\n* After that date and before February, 15, 2018 we apply a factor of 0.75 to the default limit for accounts which are 30-60 days old and 0.5 to those which are less then 30 days old.\n* After February, 15, 2018 we apply the target factor of 0.5 to the default limit for accounts which are 30-60 days old and 0.25 to those which are less than 30 days old.\n\nOffers which do not contain the accountAgeWitness hash (i.e. those created before v0.6) will become invalid after February 2018. This is important because we need to make it very difficult (ideally, impossible) to circumvent the account age verification scheme.\n\nThe trade amount limit is part of the OfferPayload, so it is flexible with changes in updates and the value at offer creation time will be taken for both traders even if the hard coded value in the application would have been changed in an update and one of the traders have not updated yet. The reduction factors and the time schedule is not part of the offer and cannot be changed in future updates without breaking backward compatibility. We consider that risk acceptable and choose not to add that data to the offer to not overload the offer with details.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Project management", "content": "This article documents the project management process used within the Bisq DAO.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the project management process is to ensure we:\n\n* work on what's most important,\n* finish what we start,\n* stay within our budget, and\n* don't spread ourselves too thin.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n## = Most work is project work\n=\n\nMany efforts under the Bisq DAO require multiple tasks to be carried out by multiple contributors, possibly across multiple teams and a span of time. Such efforts are best managed as ''projects'' having a beginning and an end, with clear criteria for delivery and a strong owner who takes responsibility for its success.\n\n## = Identifying candidate projects\n=\n\nGood examples of candidate projects include:\n\n* Adding a new feature or making a major enhancement to the Bisq client\n* Introducing a new process within the Bisq DAO or significantly changing an existing one\n\nNon-examples include:\n\n* Typo fixes\n* Minor enhancements and bug fixes\n* Carrying out the regular duties of a given role\n\nIt is ultimately a judgement call whether a given effort should be managed as a project. Here are a few rules of thumb:\n\n* Does it require multiple tasks? It's probably a project.\n* Does it require people other than yourself to take action? It's probably a project.\n* Does it require documentation and/or promotion to make sure people know about it? It's probably a project.\n\nWork that starts out as a single task may evolve to become a project, and that's fine. But by thinking ahead a little, we can often identify projects up front and better manage them as a result.\n\n## = Good project management scales\n=\n\nA primary goal of the project management process is to help the DAO scale. We want many contributors collaborating on many efforts in parallel with minimal management. To achieve this, the process must have a bottom-up aspect in which any contributor can propose a project and any stakeholder can participate in approving it, and it must also have a top-down aspect for allocating budget to the most important projects. The approach laid out here is designed to strike that balance.\n\n## Roles and teams\n\n## = Project owner\n=\n\nA project owner:\n\n* is responsible for the delivery of a given project\n* is usually the same contributor that proposes the project\n* attends review meetings and reports on the project(s) they are responsible for\n\n## = Stakeholders and users\n=\n\nDAO stakeholders and Bisq users are responsible for providing approval feedback on project proposals.\n\n## = Project management committee\n=\n\nThe [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/pmc @bisq-network/pmc] is responsible for the overall project management process, including:\n\n* triaging new project proposals\n* accepting or rejecting proposals per stakeholder approval\n* leading project review calls\n\n## = Team leads\n=\n\n[https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/team-leads @bisq-network/team-leads] are responsible for prioritizing accepted projects by allocating budget to them.\n\n## = Contributors\n=\n\nContributors are responsible for performing the tasks necessary to deliver a project.\n\n## Resources\n\n## = Projects repository\n=\n\nProjects are managed as GitHub Issues at https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues. The [https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project-proposal.md issue template] there defines what a well-formed project proposal should include.\n\n## = Project boards\n=\n\nAn approved project may have its own dedicated project board at https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/projects for the purpose of tracking individual tasks. Otherwise, tasks may be tracked as simple checkboxes in the project issue description or by whatever means the project owner sees fit (e.g. an external kanban board); in general, however, it is preferred that everything is managed within GitHub Issues.\n\n## = Master projects board\n=\n\nThe master projects board is available at https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/projects/3 and provides an overview of all projects and their status.\n\n## Process\n\n## = Overview\n=\n\nAnyone may **propose** a project so long as they are prepared to ''own'' it. Each new proposal goes through **triage** and, if ''well-formed'', moves on to stakeholder **approval** where it is ''accepted'' or ''rejected'' on its merits. An accepted project is allocated **budget** according to its priority and is subject to regular **review** until the project is **closed** as ''delivered'' or ''aborted''.\n\n## = Proposal\n=\n\nTo create a well-formed project proposal:\n\n# Create a [https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/new/choose new issue in the projects repository]\n# Choose the Project proposal issue template\n# Adhere to the format of the template and fill out its content according to the instructions within\n\nNew project proposal issues are automatically labeled as a:proposal and needs:triage.\n\n## = Triage\n=\n\nA member of the project management committee will add each new project proposal to the Backlog column of the master projects board and assess whether it is well-formed according to the issue template.\n\nIf a proposal is well-formed, the triager will:\n* remove the needs:triage label,\n* add the needs:approval label and\n* add a corresponding comment.\n\nIf a proposal is not well-formed, the triager will:\n* add the needs:info label and a comment asking the submitter to provide the missing information, or\n* add the was:invalid label and close the issue immediately with a corresponding comment.\n\n## = Approval\n=\n\nLike any DAO proposal, anyone may add comments providing feedback on a project proposal and may react to the proposal issue description with thumbs-up, thumbs-down or confused face emoji to indicate whether they believe the project should be approved. The goal is to arrive at a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus rough consensus] whether to approve the project.\n\nTaking a project proposal through formal stakeholder voting should be avoided unless there is significant contention.\n\nOnce consensus has been achieved, a member of the project management committee will:\n\n* remove the a:proposal and needs:approval labels\n* add the has:approval or was:rejected label as appropriate\n* add a comment indicating the status change\n* close the issue if rejected\n\n## = Budgeting\n=\n\nAcceptance of a project is distinct from allocating budget to it. Acceptance indicates that a project is worth doing; allocating budget indicates that a project ''has priority.'' Team leads are responsible for reviewing accepted projects and adding the has:budget label when budget has been allocated.\n\n## = Work\n=\n\n##\nStarting work\n##\n\nWork may be started at any time on a project, even prior to approval and budgeting, but contributors should have no expectation of cooperation or compensation until the project has both.\n\nIn any case, when work starts, the project owner should move the project to the In progress column of the master projects board and add a corresponding comment.\n\nIf work is being resumed after a period of inactivity, the project owner should also remove any labels such as is:blocked or is:stalled.\n\n##\nStopping work\n##\n\nWhen work stops for an extended period the project owner should move the project issue to the Backlog column with a corresponding comment. If the project is blocked in some way, the is:blocked label should be applied. If work has stalled due to inactivity, the is:stalled label should be applied.\n\n##\nRequesting help\n##\n\nIf a project cannot progress because a certain skill set is not available within the current team of contributors, the project owner should add the needs:help label with a corresponding comment that explains what kind of help is needed.\n\n## = Review\n=\n\n**''UPDATE:** These bi-weekly calls may not be the way to go. We might end up doing things more asynchronously through issue comments and perhaps a once-a-month project review call. See https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/182#issuecomment-621167017 for ongoing discussion.''\n\nApproved projects are subject to a bi-weekly (once every two weeks) review call in which each project owner provides a brief summary of their project, including whether it is on or off track, blocked for any reason, at risk of exceeding its scope or budget, etc. See the events calendar for details.\n\n## = Closure\n=\n\n##\nClosing as delivered\n##\n\nProjects that meet their criteria for delivery will be closed with the was:delivered label and a corresponding comment.\n\n##\nClosing as aborted\n##\n\nProjects may be aborted prior to delivery for a variety of reasons, including abandonment by project owner, consensus that the effort is no longer worth pursuing, exceeding allocated budget, being blocked by external factors, and so forth. Such projects will be closed with the was:aborted label and a corresponding comment.\n\n##\nClosing as deferred\n##\n\nProjects that are blocked or stalled for an extended period of time may be closed with the was:deferred label and a corresponding comment. Deferral is appropriate if the project is something that we'd still like to do, but see no near-term path to actually working on. A deferred project may be reopened when it becomes feasible to work on it, but any prior budget allocation should be assumed invalid.\n\n##\nClosing as superseded\n##\n\nProjects may be closed with the was:superseded label when another project becomes a more appropriate vehicle for getting the same or similar work done. When closing, a comment should be added providing a link to the superseding project.\n\n## = Compensation\n=\n\nIdeally, compensation should be requested after a project has been closed, but this is not always practical. A contributor may request compensation for work on a given project prior to that project's closure assuming that the work in question has itself been meaningfully delivered. For example, if a Growth Team project involves creating and publishing an instructional video, the video creator may request compensation for their work assuming the video has been published and promoted to its intended audience even if the larger growth project is still in progress.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Proposals", "content": "**Proposals** are a way to suggest significant ''project-wide'' changes or new initiatives where a broad consensus of contributors, users, and stakeholders is desired. Smaller changes to existing components, infrastructure, or processes are generally best discussed in other channels (on Matrix, other GitHub repositories, etc).\n\nThis article covers the roles, processes, and conventions for proposals.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Roles\n\n* Proposals Maintainer\n\n## Processes\n\nAnyone may submit new proposals and/or review other proposals. But there are things you can do to make it more likely your ideas are received well.\n\n## = Submission and Review\n=\n\n##\nResearch and Evaluate\n##\n\nProposals are supposed to be significant items with enough weight to draw attention from core contributors, users, and stakeholders from across functions.\n\nAccordingly, proposals should be well-considered, well-researched, and well-articulated.\n\nAs a result, before submitting a proposal, please:\n# Discuss your idea with other contributors to see if a proposal is worth submitting at all\n# Search through existing proposals (both [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues open and closed]) to see whether something similar has already been proposed\n# Notice which among those proposals have been accepted and rejected, and why\n# Read this article to fully understand the proposal process and guidelines\n\nLook through past proposals that succeeded to get a feel for how they were structured.\n\n##\nCreate GitHub Issue\n##\n\nOnce you've done research, floated your idea in the community in other channels, and think your idea might garner broader support, create a new GitHub issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues|bisq-network/proposals repository on GitHub], written and formatted according to the following guidelines:\n\n* Write your proposal in a way that makes it as easy as possible to achieve rough consensus. This means that proposals should be as simple, focused, concrete and well-defined as possible. Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your fellow contributors to understand and agree with you.\n* Take full responsibility for your proposal. It is not the maintainers' job, nor anyone else’s, to see your proposal succeed. If people aren’t responding or reacting to your proposal, it’s your job to solicit that feedback more actively.\n* Never assume that anyone other than yourself is going to do the work described in your proposal. If your proposal does place expectations on other contributors, or requires them to change their behavior in any way, be explicit about that.\n* Provide context. Make a strong case for your proposal. Link to prior discussions. Do not make your reader do any more work than they have to to understand your proposal.\n* Format your proposal well. Make it a pleasure to read.\n\nIn general, good proposals take time to research and write. Every minute you spend clearly and logically articulating your proposal is a minute that you save other contributors in understanding it. This diligence on your part will be appreciated and rewarded by others' attention.\n\nA maintainer will quickly review your proposal and will either (a) assign it to you to indicate your ownership and responsibility over it, or (b) close it and label it as was:incorrect if it does not follow the guidelines listed above.\n\n##\nReview\n##\n\nOnce a proposal is submitted, a two-week review period follows.\n\nDuring this period, interested reviewers should read, discuss and ultimately [https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments react] to the proposal as follows:\n* 👍: I agree with the proposal and want to see it enacted.\n* 😕: I am uncertain about the proposal and I need more information.\n* 👎: I disagree with the proposal and do not want to see it enacted.\n\nTry to provide an explanation of your reaction, especially when reacting with a 😕 or 👎. If you don’t, then don’t expect your opinion to have much weight or get addressed.\n\nIf you do not understand or care about a given proposal, ignore it.\n\nUse comments on the proposal issue to discuss, ask questions, and get clarifications. Take lengthy discussions offline to Matrix or elsewhere and then summarize them back on the issue.\n\n##\nEvaluate\n##\n\nThe proposal review process is all about reaching a rough consensus, meaning that there is a broad agreement that the proposal should be enacted, and that any dissenting opinions have been addressed, though not necessarily fully resolved.\n\nAfter the two-week review period is over, a maintainer will evaluate reactions to and discussions about the proposal and will close the issue with a comment explaining that it is approved or rejected based on whether a rough consensus was achieved.\n\nApproved proposals will be labeled with was:approved. Rejected proposals will be labeled with was:rejected.\n\nIf rough consensus has not been achieved, e.g. because discussion is still ongoing, dissenting concerns have not been addressed, or the proposal has turned out to be contentious, the maintainer will indicate that they cannot close the proposal, and that it is up to the submitter to take next steps to move the proposal forward. One option is to submit the proposal to the DAO for voting. If the proposal does not move forward after another two weeks, the maintainer will close and label it was:stalled.\n\nIf there have been no or very few reactions to a proposal after the two-week period, the maintainer will close it and label it as was:ignored.\n\n##\nEnact\n##\n\nAssuming your proposal was approved, the next step is to actually enact the changes described in that proposal, perhaps by creating a project or simply getting to work.\n\n## = Submit to the DAO (if needed)\n=\n\nSometimes it is necessary to submit proposals to the DAO for voting:\n* DAO parameter changes\n* proposal for bonded roles\n* contentious proposals for which there is strong interest but no clear consensus\n\nFor most general proposals this should not be necessary—general proposals that have clear consensus (or clear lack of consensus) don't need to be voted upon in the DAO. In any case, a DAO submission should only be considered after considerable discussion on GitHub so that voters have context and reason to vote one way or another. Do not submit a DAO proposal before such discussion is established.\n\nSee how to submit a proposal for DAO voting.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Remote control via web browser using xpra", "content": "This guide will have you follow the steps needed to run Bisq on a headless server (could even be a VPS), running Linux (preferably Debian or one of its derivatives), and accessing it using a web browser as if you were in front of the application itself (tested with Firefox, should work with any other major alternative).\n\n## Requirements\n\nAs a rule of thumb, at least 1GB of free RAM is needed, as are 2GB of disk space, on an amd64 architecture (no Raspberry Pi will work, nor old 32bit CPUs, while your average 64bit desktop CPU will run just fine).\n\n## Installing xpra\n\nAs customary, update your system:\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt dist-upgrade\n```\n\nFor good measure, add xpra repository\n\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n```\n\n\nAdd the following to bottom of file and then save with **Ctrl-X** followed by **Y**\n\n```\ndeb https://xpra.org/ bullseye main # edit \"bullseye\" with your version if needed\n```\n\n\nAdd xpra GPG key\n\n```\nwget -q https://xpra.org/gpg.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n```\n\n\nRefresh repositories\n\n```\nsudo apt update\n```\n\n\nand install\n\n```\nsudo apt install xpra\n```\n\n\nVerify\n\n```\nxpra --version\n```\n\n## Installing Bisq from source\n\nWe are going to run Bisq on a headless system (no desktop environment) so installing the deb file will most likely not work. Since we are nerds and like to do things the hard way, we will get the source from github, and build the application ourselves.\n\n## = Create Bisq user\n=\n\nIf you deem it functional, add a user specifically for Bisq\n\n```\nsudo adduser --gecos \"\" --disabled-password bisq\n```\n\n\n\n## = Install git and Java\n=\n\nWe will need the git package to clone Bisq repository, and Java so that Bisq will run\n\n```\nsudo apt install default-jre default-jdk git\n```\n\n\n\n## = Prepare paths for Bisq\n=\n\nMove in a folder where you want the bisq application folder to reside, we will use the bisq user as per the example above, and the custom myapps subfolder of your home (you can place it direcly in home, or wherever you please where the running user has r/w access)\n\n```\nsudo su - bisq\nmkdir -p myapps\ncd myapps\n```\n\n## = Install Bisq\n=\n\nClone the latest version repository and compile the source:\n\n```\ngit clone --branch release/v1.9.10 https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq # change 1.9.10 with current latest version\ncd bisq\n./gradlew build\n```\n\n## Use Bisq remotely\n\nNow the fun begins, as you can run bisq through xpra:\n\n```\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop\n```\n\n\nThen, from the browser on your local machine, go to remoteserverip:9876\n\nIt will load into a GUI, where you should see your Bisq app barely showing in the bottom right corner; if that happens, click on the \"images/windows\" icon in the top floating menu, you should see a list of Bisq windows; press the \"maximize\" icon to show the windows on your screen, and then act accordingly. The same menu action might be needed when popups are shown, as in order to interact with buttons in said popups you sometimes have to manually focus on the popup via the floating menu.\n\nWhen you have to restart Bisq for any reason (for example to refresh tor files, to resync SPV or DAO state) you have to run, on the remote machine:\n\n```\nxpra stop :100 # to stop the running xpra instance\nxpra stop :100 # once more, to REALLY stop the running xpra instance (sometimes it won't work with just one call, especially when restarting Bisq)\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop # to restart Bisq through xpra\n```\n\n\nThis command will make you wait 20s as a timeout to fully close any existing xpra sessions, after which the application will be launched. You should make the above lines into an executable script, so you can just launch that and have it (re)start Bisq:\n\n```\ncd /home/bisq\nnano bisqxpra\n# add the above lines in the file and then save with Ctrl-X and press Y\nchmod +x bisqxpra\n./bisqxpra #launch Bisq\n```\n\n## Tips\n\nWhen you want to restart Bisq, you could just execute the above script, but it would terminate Bisq in a potentially breaking way, so it's best to first log into the web interface, close Bisq using the window close button, and only then start the script.\n\nWant to use a custom data folder, just like you maybe used a custom application folder? Add the relevant parameter to the Bisq command:\n\n```\n# make sure you leave the quotes in, to enclose the command to start as a single entity\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=\"/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop --appData=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq-data\"\n```\n\n\nWant to add password authentication, so the Bisq instance isn't accessible to just anyone finding its port on the local network?\n\n```\n# replace password123 with your password, no need for advanced security as anyone able to access your remote server to see this, will have also access to Bisq anyway\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876,auth=password:value=password123 --html=on --start=\"/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop --appData=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq-data\"\n```", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Restoring application data", "content": "**Restoring application data** can be useful to bring back payment accounts, onion addresses, and other items from a backup—or to move your Bisq instance to an entirely new machine.\n\nYou can restore an entire data directory at once, or just the parts you want.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Restore an entire data directory =\n\nFirst make sure Bisq is closed. Then copy the entire Bisq directory from your backup and paste it in your machine's default data directory location. If there already is a directory called Bisq there, remove it (or rename it) and replace it with your backup.\n\nData directories work across operating systems, so you can copy a data directory created on a Mac to the appropriate location on Linux or Windows, and it will work.\n\nPlease **do not** run the same data directory on 2 machines at the same time, even if you don't run both instances at the same time, as data may get corrupted in strange ways.\n\n= Restore payment accounts =\n\nA payment account export only contains metadata (name, bank information, etc). For fiat accounts, this means that restoring payment accounts is a 2-step process.\n\n## Restore payment account metadata\n\nIf you have a payment accounts export file, import it in Account > National Currency Accounts.\n\nIf you don't have an export file, but you do have a full backup, you can salvage your payment account metadata from btc_mainnet/db/UserPayload by running the strings utility on the UserPayload file (e.g., run strings /path/to/backup/btc_mainnet/db/UserPayload in a terminal window). The command will output a simplified version of the UserPayload file to your terminal. Scroll up a bit and you should see your payment account information.\n\nUse the output to copy and paste the details into new payment accounts in Bisq, paying special attention to make sure each field is copied over with 100% accuracy (including the salt): even a 1 character difference in any field will cause the hash of the payment account to be different, which means aging and signing status will not be restored in the following step.\n\nThere are quirks. Here's an example of output from a strings command:\n\nSEPA\nAlice Liddell\nDE89370400440532013000\nDEUTDE5X*\nSKzH\nsalt\n@56655c3738ea9dea3b20f482fff048985a2757e57dff206fbd9e8c4f267f7781\n\nFrom the output above:\n* Be wary of extra characters at the beginning or end of a line. In the example above, the * character is not part of the BIC \"DEUTDE5X\".\n* Salts are alphanumeric, so the @ is not part of the salt \"56655c3738ea9dea3b20f482fff048985a2757e57dff206fbd9e8c4f267f7781\".\n\nIf you're on Windows, or cannot use the strings utility for some other reason, you can just open UserPayload directly in a text editor, but there will be more cruft to sift through since the file isn't meant to be human-readable.\n\nIt may be tempting to just replace the entire UserPayload file from a backup, but this is **not recommended**, as it may contain other data that could result in data corruption in your new instance.\n\n## Restore payment account aging and signing status\n\nOnce you've restored your payment account metadata, you'll see the accounts in Bisq, but they'll have no aging or signing status.\n\nYou can get aging and signing status back by replacing btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key from your backup.\n# Make sure you have no active offers, trades or disputes; once you change sig.key, you will become unreachable.\n# Close Bisq. Also make sure you've made a backup of your data directory (just in case).\n# Replace /path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/keys/sig.key with the sig.key from your backup.\n\nUpon opening Bisq, you should see account aging and signing status restored for your fiat payment accounts.\n\nIf you don't, double-check:\n* You copied account metadata and salt correctly in the previous step.\n* The sig.key you copied is the correct one (i.e., the one you were using when your accounts accrued aging and/or got signed)\n\n= Restore onion address =\n\nYour onion address determines your local reputation, so depending on your preferences, you may want to reset it or restore it over time.\n\nIf you want to restore it:\n* Close Bisq. Also make sure you've made a backup of your data directory (just in case).\n* Replace the /path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservices/ folder with the btc_mainnet/tor/hiddenservices/ folder from your backup.\n\nWhen you open Bisq, your onion address will be restored.\n\nThis means that the peers that have traded with you will see bubbles with trade counts in their offer books for ''your'' offers.\n\n= Restore trade history =\n\nYou may want to keep your trade history despite changing wallets. You can do so by:\n* Closing Bisq.\n* Replacing the /path/to/data/directory/btc_mainnet/db/ClosedTrades file on your new directory with the file from backup with the same name.\n\nYou will see bubbles with trade counts in the offer books for any any peers you traded with.\n\n= Restore wallet =\n\nIt's good to start with a clean wallet every so often, because Bisq wallets use the bitcoinj library, which causes wallet files to get increasingly larger with every transaction. Wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and performance suffers (e.g. long startup times). If starting a new data directory, it's generally best to just send funds from one Bisq instance to another with an on-chain transaction.", "category": "general"}

If restarting Bisq causes the resync to start over from 0% instead of resuming, you can try this:\n# Ensure Bisq is completely **closed**.\n# Navigate to the root folder of your Bisq data directory.\n# Locate and **delete** the file named `resyncSpv`. (This file typically only exists if a previous resync was interrupted).\n# **Restart Bisq**.\nIt should now attempt to resume the SPV sync from where it previously left off.\n\n## Preventing Frequent or Slow Resyncs: Connect to Your Own Node\n\nIf you find that Bisq frequently requires SPV file resyncs, or if the process consistently takes an extremely long time (especially with an older or high-transaction wallet), the most robust solution is to connect Bisq to your own Bitcoin full node.\n\nWhen connected to your local node, Bisq gets blockchain information directly and reliably, bypassing the need for the SPV synchronization process over the Tor network. This typically results in faster startups and eliminates most common sync-related issues and errors.\n\nFor details on setting up a node and configuring Bisq to use it, please see:\n* Installing your own Bitcoin node\n* Connecting to your own Bitcoin node\n\nWhile running a full node requires more resources (disk space, bandwidth), it offers the best performance, privacy, and stability when using Bisq.\n\nCategory:Use Cases\nCategory:Troubleshooting", "category": "general"}

For example, someone must merge pull requests into the bisq repository, someone must manage DNS for the bisq.network domain, a group of people must maintain critical infrastructure such as seed nodes and price nodes, etc.\n\nThis document defines the system of roles used within the Bisq DAO to enumerate, define and track each of these responsibilities. The system is designed with two major goals in mind:\n# To maximize role owner autonomy in order to achieve Bisq's decentralization goals\n# To maximize transparency so that DAO stakeholders can effectively review and vote on role owner compensation requests\n\n## Properties\n\nThe following are properties common to all roles.\n\n## = Duties\n=\n\n''Duties'' are actions that must be performed for a certain resource or process to function normally.\n\nFor example, a repository maintainer’s duties include merging pull requests in a timely fashion, and a website operator’s duties include keeping the site available at all times.\n\n## = Rights\n=\n\n''Rights'' are special permissions or other access required to perform the Duties of a role.\n\nFor example, a repository maintainer’s rights include write permissions to their repository, and a website operator’s rights include administrative access to site hosting infrastructure.\n\n## = Owners\n=\n\n''Owners'' are contributors who have the Rights required to perform the Duties of a role.\n\nOne owner is designated as primary and any other owners are designated as [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/12 secondary]. The primary is responsible for performing the Duties of the role, while secondaries stand by, ready to take over for the primary at any time.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe following infrastructure is used to define and manage each role.\n\n## = Wiki\n=\n\nEach role should be documented here on https://bisq.wiki in a document of its own, ideally linked to the larger resource or process it's related to.\n\nFor example, there is a proposals wiki article covering the concept and process of proposals for users, and a proposals maintainer article covering the role's rights, duties, and other details.\n\nEach role’s documentation should specify the role's:\n* duties\n* rights\n* GitHub team\n* GitHub issue\n* bonding requirement (if any)\n\n## = Team\n=\n\nEach role has a dedicated GitHub team where each of the role’s Owners are members. The team is used to manage access to GitHub repositories that the role is responsible for and to send notifications to role owners with @mentions in GitHub issues and pull requests.\n\nFor example, the [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/bisq-maintainers @bisq-network/bisq-maintainers] team has write access to the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq bisq-network/bisq] repository.\n\nThe primary role owner is also assigned as the ''maintainer'' of their role’s GitHub team, such that they may manage the team without requiring the intervention of a GitHub admin.\n\n## = Issue\n=\n\nEach role has a dedicated GitHub issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues bisq-network/roles] repository, wherein:\n* The **Assignees** field is used to track role ownership.\n* The **Description** field is used to link to the role’s wiki article, team, and primary owner.\n* **Comments** are used for reporting and feedback.\n\nSee the [Compensation Maintainer https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/86] role issue for an example.\n\n## Types\n\nMost roles fit into one of the types below.\n\n## = Maintainer\n=\n\nA ''Maintainer'' is a contributor responsible for enforcing process in a given GitHub repository.\n\nExamples: [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/63 Bisq Maintainer], [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/30 Proposals Maintainer]\n\n##\nMaintainer duties\n##\n\n* Merging or closing pull requests after sufficient review\n* Tagging releases\n* Triaging incoming issues and keeping them organized over time\n\n**A maintainer is not a developer or reviewer.**\n\nSubmitting and reviewing pull requests is something any contributor can do; neither are maintainer duties per se.\n\nThis is particularly important from a compensation perspective. If you are a maintainer, do NOT group your development and review activities together with your maintainer role in your compensation requests. Rather, account for them separately like any other contributor would.\n\nThe goal is to have as many competent contributors developing and reviewing as possible, not to load everything on the maintainer.

The report should contain whatever information the role owner believes would be valuable to other users, contributors, and stakeholders.\n\nThe comment should be formatted in Markdown as follows:\n\n## Cycle 21 Report\n\nDescription and/or list of contributions, accomplishments, or other notable occurrences since the last role report was posted.\n\n/cc bisq-network/compensation#421\n\nThe /cc part should reference the GitHub issue for the contributor's compensation request for the cycle corresponding to the role report.\n\n## Bonding\n\nMost roles involve special rights that, if abused, could cause damage to the Bisq Network. For this reason, role owners must put up a bond in BSQ [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/state/model/governance/BondedRoleType.java commensurate with the amount of damage that could be caused].

{"title": "Running Bisq on Tails", "content": "__TOC__\n\n## Overview\n\nUnlike most operating systems, [https://tails.boum.org/about/ Tails runs ''entirely'' in memory.] When Tails shuts down, memory contents are deleted, restoring the OS to its original state. Only files saved to the [https://tails.boum.org/doc/persistent_storage/ Persistent Storage] survive a reboot.\n\nTherefore, Bisq must be reinstalled (and configured) after every boot. More importantly, Bisq's default data directory must be relocated to the **Persistent Storage** so that your wallet, keys, etc. are not lost every time Tails shuts down.\n\nThis is easy to automate with an installation script.\n\n## Preparations\n\n## = Configure Tails\n=\n\nOn the Tails [https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/ Welcome Screen:]\n* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/ Set up an administration password.]\n* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/persistent_storage/create/ Create Persistent Storage.]\n\nOnce Persistent Storage has been created, a settings window will open automatically.

{"title": "SWIFT", "content": "**SWIFT** (international wire transfer) is a network that allows financial institutions worldwide to send and receive payments internationally in multiple currencies.\n\nSender and receiver typically incur fees and payment times can also be slow (up to 7 days), but payments are secure and almost completely irreversible.\n\nSee this table for up-to-date trade limits and signing requirements.\n\n## Background\n\nAlmost all banks have access to the SWIFT network. Some money transfer services also give users access to the SWIFT Network.\n\nIn order to set up a SWIFT payment account in Bisq, you will need:\n* BIC/SWIFT code\n* IBAN code\n\nAlso ensure that you are aware of:\n* bank fees for sending and receiving SWIFT payments\n* which currencies you can accept\n* what the exchange rate would be in case conversion is necessary\n\n**Policies vary by bank, and sometimes conversion fees are charged unexpectedly, so make sure you are aware of your bank's policies beforehand.**\n\n## Setting up the payment account\n\nWhen creating a new payment account for SWIFT, keep the following in mind:\n* Traders using SWIFT on Bisq could be anywhere in the world, so please fill all fields completely and accurately\n* If you are not comfortable sharing your own address, provide the address of your bank\n\nNote: if you transact in a currency that is not native to your bank account (as either maker OR taker), your bank may make you pay currency exchange fees. **It is your responsibility to cover these fees.** Please make 100% sure you're aware of what to expect before making or taking an offer.\n\n## Notes on buying BTC\n\nYou can buy BTC with SWIFT on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer to buy BTC on a currency market of your choosing\n# Take an offer to buy BTC on the currency market specified in the offer\n\n## = Send payment in correct currency\n=\n\n**The bitcoin buyer must send payment in the currency of the market on which the offer was made.** For example, if you make an offer to buy BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/USD market you should send USD (or ensure your bank converts your local currency into USD). Alternatively, if you take an offer to buy BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/EUR market you must send EUR.\n\nFailure to send payment in the correct currency will result in a penalty for the BTC buyer of either (1) 5% of the trade amount or (2) the amount the receiver is missing in the specified currency as a result of the currency exchange (whichever is greater).\n\n## = Put an appropriate reason for payment\n=\n\nIn general, the reason for payment field should be left blank.\n\nSome users have reported instances in which an intermediary bank converts a payment's currency to the their own currency before converting back to the destination bank's local currency, and taking fees for doing this.\n\nIf you don't want this to happen, consider making the SWIFT sender put \"DO NOT CONVERT\" in the comment field for the wire transfer (not the comment field of the Bisq payment account). This will only work if the recipient is able to handle multi-currency incoming SWIFT payments.\n\n## = Use the correct fee option\n=\n\nSWIFT transfers for Bisq trades should use the SHA (SHAred) fee option. More on this below.\n\n## Notes on selling BTC\n\nYou can sell BTC with SWIFT on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer to sell BTC on a currency market of your choosing\n# Take an offer to sell BTC on the currency market specified in the offer\n\nThe BTC seller should receive the funds in the currency specified in the offer. For example, if you ''make'' an offer to sell BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/USD market, you will receive USD. Alternatively if you ''take'' an offer to sell BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/EUR market, you will receive EUR.\n\nSince SWIFT senders must use the SHA (SHAred) fee option for Bisq trades, sellers may incur fees on their end (see more below). Make sure you are aware of these fees before selling BTC using SWIFT.\n\n## Understanding SWIFT fees\n\nWhen sending a SWIFT transfer the sender has three fee options to choose from:\n\n* BEN (BENeficiary) – payee (recipient of the payment) incurs all payment transaction fees. Typically, the recipient receives the payment minus the transaction fees. The payer (sender of the payment) does not pay any transaction fees.\n* OUR – payer (sender of the payment) incurs all payment transaction fees. Normally you are billed separately for the payment transfer. The payee (recipient of the payment) does not pay any transaction fees. The beneficiary receives the full payment amount.\n* SHA (SHAred) – payer (sender of the payment) pays all fees charged by the sending bank, which are billed separately. The payee (recipient of the payment) pays all fees charged by their receiving bank. The recipient receives the payment minus any applicable fees.\n\n**Bisq requires buyers to use the SHA (SHAred) fee option for SWIFT transfers.** If a BTC buyer sends a payment using the BEN (BENeficiary) fee option, they will likely incur a penalty to compensate the BTC seller.\n\nPlease make sure you are aware of your bank's fee schedule for the SHA (SHAred) fee option. Normally it will be $5-25 USD equivalent, but every bank is different.", "category": "general"}

In addition to delivering quality customer support, a support agent must:\n\n* Be a Bisq user, proficient enough to assist others.\n* Dedicate 10 hours per week to monitor various support channels and provide assistance.\n* Be familiar with Bisq's current [knowledge base] documents.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming a support agent, see the #Internship section below.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nIncludes all of Support Team#Infrastructure, plus the following:\n\n## = Calendar\n=\n\nThe calendar tracks support events.\n\n* [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u4eea6bffk10b76l2cmb86eqqc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FVienna Public HTML]\n* [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/u4eea6bffk10b76l2cmb86eqqc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics iCal File]\n* [https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dTRlZWE2YmZmazEwYjc2bDJjbWI4NmVxcWNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ Google Calendar] (login required)\n\n## =GitHub team\n=\n* [https://github.com/orgs/bisq-network/teams/support-agents @bisq-network/support-agents] (includes l1, l2 and intern subteams)\n\n## =Role issue\n=\n* [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/64 L1 Support Agent #64]\n\n## Duties\n\n## =Handle support cases\n=\nBisq support agents will dedicate at least 10 hours each week to monitor the various support channels and assist users with their issues.\n\n## =Report issues to developers\n=\nRequired data to request support from developers:\n\n* Create a directory with the trade ID as name\n* Add a short description in a plain text file of the problem/bug. Use BTC buyer/BTC seller if you refer to any trader. Ask user when the issue happened so its easier to find the issue in the logs.\n* Ask them if they have done anything non-standard or had past issues.\n* Add all available trade tx IDs of both traders as plain text to the report.\n* Get a screenshot of the trade details window (click on trade ID). Tell users to only blur out the payment account details but not the tx IDs or other data. There is no relevant privacy issue with exposing trade ID, tx IDs or onion address.\n* Add a screenshot from the mediators dispute details window. The contract as json data is not required initially and only needed if the dev requests it. The payment account data in the json file should be removed before handing over to a dev to protect traders privacy.\n* Get all log files from both users (at Account/Backup there is a button for opening the data dir) - its up to 11 files.\n* Put all logs from one user into a directory named buyer and seller\n* Add a screenshot of both traders first chat message (system message containing data like version number/OS,...)\n* If there have been any error/warning popups request a screenshot of that as well.\n* Zip all and send it on Matrix chat as PM to a dev who has committed to work on it.

{"title": "Switching to a new data directory", "content": "**Switching to a new data directory** can help you start with Bisq anew: fresh wallet, new onion address, new keys, etc. It's a sort of \"factory reset\" that makes it like you're starting Bisq for the first time.\n\nUpon creating a new data directory, you can restore various parts of a previous data directory (e.g., aged and signed payment accounts).\n\nIf you instead wish to only obtain a new wallet, while preserving every other element of your data directory, you can create a fresh wallet in the same data directory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Why switch to a new data directory? =\n\nIt's a good idea to switch to a new data directory every so often.\n* **Performance** - Bisq uses bitcoinj, an SPV library that is not built for high performance, so wallets get increasingly large with every transaction. Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).\n* **Stability** - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.\n* **Privacy** - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see local reputation).\n\nIn addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around unusual wallet corruption issues.\n\n= Make sure you're ready to switch =\n\n## = Ensure your existing data directory is backed up\n=\n\nSee how here. Be sure to also do a payment account export to make importing payment accounts easier.\n\n## = Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes\n=\n\nThis is paramount because **you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.** If you don't want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.\n\n= Send funds =\n\nYou will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow.\n\nThere are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.\n\n# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from Funds > Send Funds, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in Settings > Preferences).\n#* Variation: Use the Emergency Wallet Tool (Cmd/Ctrl + E) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn't working.\n# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it. This method is **not** recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See derivation path and other details here.\n# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).\n## Start Bisq.\n## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the appName option. See how to run Bisq from the command line here.\n##* macOS example command: /Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new\n##* Name of the new directory doesn't matter. Bisq-new was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it's just a temporary placeholder. You'll be changing it back to \"Bisq\" anyway.\n## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.\n## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.\n\n= Create new data directory =\n\nIf you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:\n# Close Bisq.\n# Delete (or rename) the Bisq data directory (see default locations for your operating system here).\n# Start Bisq again.

{"title": "Trading GRIN", "content": "**[https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/grin4bitcoiners.md GRIN]** is a minimalistic, lightweight cryptocurrency, implementing the Mimblewimble protocol for a unique balance of privacy and scalability.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Buying GRIN\n\nBuying GRIN is like buying any other altcoin. It requires a GRIN payment account in Bisq. The GRIN slatepack address to be used is issued by your GRIN wallet.\n\nWhen buying, you should keep your GRIN wallet open to receive the payment. If that is not feasible, you can also receive GRIN by exchanging slatepack messages with the seller in trader chat. More information about GRIN transactions can be found [https://docs.grin.mw/about-grin/transactions here].\n\nOnce you have received the GRIN, you should confirm the receipt on Bisq so that escrowed BTC funds can be released to you and your peer.\n\n## Selling GRIN\n\nThe trader ''selling'' GRIN (BTC buyer) will send GRIN to the counterparty's slatepack address using their wallet of choice once the Bisq trade deposit is confirmed.\n\nThe amount and recipient address is displayed on-screen when you are prompted to do the transfer.\n\nExample of sending using grin-wallet:\n\n```\n./grin-wallet -r \"https://grinnode.live:3413\" send -d grin1dxnzk3gfnqz69va64ut7jafs7u72dtyswpzxekdgmlurkng9ctfqf9yqu5 10.123456789\n```\n\nThe GRIN ''buyer'' will confirm the trade in Bisq once they are satisfied that they received the correct amount of GRIN.\n\nYou must be able to generate [https://docs.grin.mw/getting-started/wallet-handbook/#proof proof of payment] in case of a dispute. Otherwise, Confidential Transactions make it impossible for a third party to verify if a payment was made. GRIN sellers must be able to generate a transaction's proof for mediators or arbitrators in case of disputes.\n\n**At this moment the only wallet capable of generating and verifying payment proofs is the [https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-wallet/releases CLI wallet] developed by the GRIN core team.**\n\nSee how to generate payment proof below.\n\n## Generate payment proof\n\nOnly the person sending the GRIN funds can create payment proof.\n\nFirst, list your transactions using txs, and look for the one you want to issue proof on.\n\nThe command export_proof will generate a file containing information to prove the details to the recipient or a mediator.\n\nFor the purpose of these examples, a public node provided by https://grinnode.live is used. If you have access to your own node running locally, you can remove the -r option completely or change it to a different http endpoint.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n./grin-wallet -r \"https://grinnode.live:3413\" txs\n\n./grin-wallet -r \"https://grinnode.live:3413\" export_proof -i 2 proof2.txt\n```\n\nContents of proof2.txt:\n\n{\n\"amount\": \"10123456789\",\n\"excess\": \"0924ca1b69531aa9abcf85ff7a2bf0d494bc1d85440339332fb62374aabaddf1d6\",\n\"recipient_address\": \"grin1dxnzk3gfnqz69va64ut7jafs7u72dtyswpzxekdgmlurkng9ctfqf9yqu5\",\n\"recipient_sig\": \"710d58fe9e728077dad9494c0d0e15ba5e883e863477aa471c753282a838d9c45966bc57d21f078c226576b6189b293eed3534b755674284a90bb99a128a7d02\",\n\"sender_address\": \"grin1ephxt0u33rz9zpl7exer2awfr9s9ae28qsx7908q2zq03uv3sj7suqdule\",\n\"sender_sig\": \"f054a71d5791532364b3267d44601531cdd6730e1eb487142ae798aa3de6e3551c4f756caec09d17901c5e6e08946f04d9d03d04af525567b6df14e25158160c\"\n}\n\nSend this proof file to a mediator in case of a dispute (e.g. payment not received, incorrect amount, etc).\n\n## Guidance for dispute agents\n\nThere are two steps for verifying the correct payment was made. Note that there is no reason to verify a proof if the amount or recipient is wrong.\n\nCheck that the proof file supplied by the GRIN seller matches the details you have for the Bisq trade.\n\nThis is just basic fact checking: did the sender proof show the correct recipient address and amount?\n\nNote that amounts are shown without a decimal place, and there are 9 digits after the decimal (e.g. \"amount\": \"10123456789\" means 10.123456789 GRIN).\n\nRun the verify_proof command to check that the transaction is recorded on the blockchain.\n\nIn order to do this, you'll need grin-wallet installed on your PC.\n\nInstall the grin wallet software from https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-wallet/releases, and then:\n\n```\n./grin-wallet -r \"https://grinnode.live:3413\" init\n```\n\nThe wallet is just used as a tool to verify transactions. You do not need a node, Tor, or a seedphrase for this.\n\nTo verify, use the command verify_proof with the details provided by the GRIN seller, e.g.\n\n```\n./grin-wallet -r \"https://grinnode.live:3413\" verify_proof ./proof2.txt\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nPayment proof's signatures are valid.\nNeither the proof's sender nor recipient address belongs to this wallet.\nCommand 'verify_proof' completed successfully\n```\n\nThis proves that the amount was sent to the recipient address shown in the proof and recorded in the GRIN ledger.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How is the price of GRIN determined?**\n\nThe price of GRIN is determined by the marketplace within Bisq.\n\nTrade price is chosen by offer maker (which can be the buyer or seller). Offers are by default arranged in the marketplace with the best prices shown at the top of the list.\n\nThe last traded price is shown in at the top right of the screen as \"Price of latest Bisq trade\".", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Trading L-BTC", "content": "**L-BTC**, or Liquid Bitcoin, is a Confidential Asset, fully verifiable, and 1:1 backed BTC token created by [https://liquid.net/ Liquid], a federated sidechain pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain. Liquid is implemented by Elements, an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform based on the Bitcoin codebase created by Blockstream.\n\nA sidechain is a mechanism that allows tokens from one blockchain to be used securely in an independent blockchain which runs in parallel and uses a different set of rules, performance requirements, and security mechanisms. On a sidechain, one can move tokens back to the original chain through a two-way peg. Sidechains enable new functionality that may have security trade-offs or as a way to test new features that may not be ready to use on the parent blockchain.\n\nThese are some new functionalities that Liquid enables:\n\n* Confidential Transactions: hides the amount from the information displayed at the blockchain -- the most important feature for most Bisq users\n* Issued Assets: allows issuing tokenized fiat, securities, altcoins or digital collectibles\n* Federated consensus mechanism: allows 2- or 3-minute settlement times in normal conditions\n* In development: Schnorr signatures, which will improve network privacy and capacity\n\nAll addresses in Liquid are blinded by default using Confidential Transactions. The asset and amount of a transaction is hidden to those watching the Liquid sidechain. Bisq users can mix their coins with all of Liquid federation BTC holdings just trading both assets.\n\n## Selling L-BTC\n\nSelling L-BTC is like selling any other altcoin. It just requires an L-BTC payment account in Bisq.\n\n## Buying L-BTC\n\nThe trader ''receiving'' L-BTC (L-BTC buyer) must be able to generate proof of payment in case of a dispute. Otherwise, Confidential Transactions make it impossible for a third party to verify if a payment was made—so L-BTC buyers must be able to generate a transaction's blinding key for mediators or arbitrators in case of disputes.\n\n## = Generate blinding key\n=\n\n**Green Wallet and other custodial wallets can't generate blinding keys, so you must use Elements Core to receive L-BTC for Bisq trades.**\n\nInstall the [https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements Elements Core full node software] (note that this does ''not'' require running a Bitcoin Core full node) and follow these steps:\n# Get the receiving L-BTC address\n# Open the GUI console window of your Elements Core full node, or use elements-cli\n# Type the command dumpblindingkey , where is the receiving L-BTC address from step 1\n\nThe Elements console will return the [https://elementsproject.org/elements-code-tutorial/confidential-transactions#blindingkey blinding key] in hex. This blinding key is what dispute agents will ask for in case an L-BTC trade ends up in dispute.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How is the price of L-BTC determined?**\n\nL-BTC is a 1:1 BTC pegged token to Bitcoin, so high volatility is not expected. Buyers and sellers make their fixed price orders close to parity. There's no price feed with market % based prices for this market.\n\n**Why not just use the peg-in and peg-out mechanism to exchange L-BTC and BTC?**\n\nA peg-in transaction (BTC to L-BTC) requires 102 confirmations on the Bitcoin network (17 hours) before funds can be claimed on the Liquid Network. Peg-out requires approval from two-thirds 2/3 Liquid functionaries approval and it takes about 17-35 minutes to complete. Bisq offers private, easy and secure L-BTC on and off-ramp.\n\n## Guidance for dispute agents\n\nIn order to verify L-BTC trades, install the Elements Core software on your computer from https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/releases, and then:\n* Set txindex=1 in elements.conf (neither L-BTC sender nor receiver need this setting)\n* Wait until Elements fully syncs to the Liquid blockchain\n\n## = Verifying a transaction\n=\n\nObtain information from trading peers:\n# Obtain the TXID for the L-BTC transaction (either trading peer can provide this information)\n# Obtain the Blinding Key for the receiving L-BTC address from the L-BTC buyer/receiver\n# Verify that both the L-BTC address and TXID are visible on https://blockstream.info/liquid\n\nVerify the transaction:\n# Open the GUI console window of your Elements Core full node, or use elements-cli\n# Type importaddress , where is the L-BTC address of the L-BTC buyer/receiver. This will add the address to your wallet as “watch only” and rescan the entire Liquid blockchain. It might take an hour or longer to complete depending on your computer's power.\n# After scanning is complete, get details for the L-BTC transaction with gettransaction true, where is the L-BTC transaction ID.

Often this results in a screen mentioning outdated Tor files and other Tor settings. This could occur for a number of reasons.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Weak internet connection\n\nBisq generally needs a strong, fast connection to work properly. Tethering on mobile connections can work but is known to cause issues.\n\n## 3/4 connection problem\n\nIf Bisq stalls at step 3/4 of the startup sequence for more than 5 minutes it means the initial data download from seednodes has failed, or is taking too long.\nThis can happen on weak or slow internet connections, or if Tor is having issues relaying the large data download to your node.\nProposed mitigation is to clear the Tor cachefiles. (Close Bisq first). All files except hiddenservice can be deleted from btc_mainnet/tor beneath the https://bisq.wiki/Data_directory#Default_locations data directory, they will be re-created as necessary at startup. hiddenservice should be kept as it defines your onion address.\n\nSee https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2547#issuecomment-1016787843\n\nFor a geekier approach, you can also try manually choosing seednodes to connect to\n\n## Windows antivirus software\n\nAntivirus software is known to cause connection issues. Try turning it off to see if it helps Bisq to connect, and if it does, consider switching antivirus software or running Bisq on another operating system on which you don't need to run antivirus.\n\n## Being temporarily banned by the Tor network\n\nTrying to open Bisq too many times in a short timeframe can result in failing to connect to the Tor network. Simple wait 30-60 minutes and then try opening Bisq again.\n\n## Tor censorship\n\nIn certain situations, Bisq may fail to start because your ISP or network provider is actively blocking Tor.\n\nTor is tries to fight such obstacles by providing ''bridges''. Bridges help you connect to the Tor network through a less well-known node. If you know someone who runs a bridge, you can ask to use their bridge, or you can go to https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges to pick a bridge listed by the Tor Project.\n\nIf you're in China, this method using SStap has worked to get around the Great Firewall.\n\n## Tor bridges that don't work\n\nSome network administrators try really hard to block all Tor activity on their network (universities are infamous for this) and will even sometimes block specific types of SSL traffic and handshakes.\n\nIn these scenarios, consider using a VPN and then running Bisq from within the VPN tunnel.\n\n## Altcoin nodes running on the same computer\n\nSome forks of the Bitcoin repository (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc) are known to cause issues with Bisq starting up. Bisq can sometimes recognize altcoin nodes as Bitcoin nodes, causing Bisq to try connecting to them and then failing when it finds no Bitcoin blocks.\n\nTo solve this, switch altcoin nodes off, turn Bisq on and let it load completely. Then, turn the altcoin nodes back on.", "category": "general"}

Please avoid replicating content in more than one place—it makes keeping the wiki up-to-date harder.\n\nIf you do find the need to repeat something, use a [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Transclusion transclusion].\n\nPractically, this is how it works:\n* Create a new page titled Template:Content_to_be_replicated.\n* Include anywhere you need it.\n\n## = Avoid using abbreviations in page titles\n=\n\nPrefer \"Deposit transaction\" over \"Deposit tx\".\n\n## = Prefer wiki headings over plain bold text\n=\n\nWiki headings appear in the table of contents, but other text doesn't, so it's better to use headings for big ideas. Furthermore, wiki headings have their own anchor links, making it possible to link directly to particular sections of a page.\n\n## = Use code blocks for UI elements\n=\n\nDenote user interface (UI) elements like tabs and buttons with literal markup (e.g., Click Start).
