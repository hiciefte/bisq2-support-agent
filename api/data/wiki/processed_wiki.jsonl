{"title": "Introduction", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBisq is a decentralized bitcoin exchange network best understood through its major components:\n\n# Bisq is primarily a cross-platform '''desktop application''' (currently Bisq 2) that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies, supporting multiple trading protocols.\n# Bisq provides '''trading protocols''' (like the classic v1 protocol and Bisq Easy) that enable individuals to exchange directly with one another over the internet, eliminating the need for trusted third-party exchange services.\n# Bisq operates on a '''peer-to-peer network''' formed by Bisq applications discovering, connecting to, and working with one another. The Bisq network is fully peer-to-peer, requires no centrally-controlled servers, and has no single points of failure.\n\nBisq is not a company—it is '''free/libre software''' released under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3). Bisq is built by individuals around the world who choose to work together, organized as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It is used by individuals globally who prefer trading directly with peers instead of using centralized bitcoin exchanges.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Why Bisq exists\n\nBisq’s mission is to provide a '''secure''', '''private''', and '''censorship-resistant''' way of exchanging bitcoin for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies over the internet.\n\n* When we say '''secure''', we are referring to the safety of users' funds. Centralized exchanges often require users to deposit funds onto exchange servers, creating large targets for hackers and thieves. Bisq avoids this custodial risk.\n* When we say '''private''', we are referring to users' ability to control their own information. Most centralized exchanges require extensive personal identification (KYC) to open an account, linking trading activity to real-world identities and creating risks of data leaks or misuse. Bisq requires no registration or KYC.\n* When we say '''censorship-resistant''', we are referring to the freedom to trade voluntarily without third-party interference. Centralized exchanges operate within specific legal jurisdictions and can be shut down or forced to comply with regulations that restrict trading or mandate surveillance. Bisq's decentralized nature resists such external control.\n\nBisq was built to fulfill this mission: providing an exchange mechanism where users keep control of their funds, privacy is the default, and the freedom to transact is defended.\n\n## How Bisq works\n\n## = In a nutshell (v1 Trade Example)\n=\n\nImagine you want to buy bitcoin (BTC) in exchange for Euros (EUR). Using Bisq's classic v1 trading protocol (which involves security deposits), you are a ''buyer'' of BTC looking for a ''seller'' of BTC who accepts EUR.\n\nThe basic steps would be:\n\n# You download, install, and run the Bisq 2 desktop application.\n# You add your EUR payment method details (e.g., SEPA bank account) to your Bisq client.\n# You browse Bisq’s offer book for existing offers to sell BTC for EUR.\n# You take an existing offer, agreeing to the seller's price and terms. This initiates the trade process, including locking BTC from both parties into escrow.\n# You send the EUR payment using your chosen method (outside of Bisq) and confirm \"Payment sent\" in the Bisq application.\n# You and the seller wait for the EUR payment to arrive in the seller's account.\n# The seller receives the EUR payment and confirms receipt in Bisq.\n# The trade completes, and the bitcoin (trade amount + your security deposit) is released to your Bisq wallet. The seller also receives their security deposit back.\n\nFor complete setup instructions, see the [https://bisq.network/getting-started/ Getting Started] guide.\n\nThe exact steps can vary depending on whether you buy or sell, act as the offer maker or taker, and the specific payment methods involved. Regardless of the protocol, the process differs significantly from centralized exchanges.\n\n## = How trading with Bisq is different\n=\n\nKey characteristics distinguish Bisq trading:\n\n* '''Desktop Application:''' Bisq runs locally on your computer, not in a web browser.\n* '''Manual Offer Taking:''' There is no automatic order matching. Users manually browse the offer book and choose specific offers from peers. This enables direct P2P settlement and user control over counterparties.\n* '''Out-of-Band Fiat Payments:''' Bisq orchestrates, but does not directly process, fiat (or altcoin) payments. These transfers happen directly between users via their chosen payment methods outside the Bisq application itself.\n\nThese differences lead to a fundamental trade-off: Bisq trades may take longer to settle than on centralized platforms, but they offer significantly enhanced security, privacy, and censorship resistance.\n\n## = How Bisq keeps funds secure\n=\nMechanisms vary by protocol, but core principles include:\n* '''Non-Custodial:''' Users always retain control of their fiat and cryptocurrency funds. Bisq never holds user funds.\n* '''Incentives/Collateral:''' Trading protocols use mechanisms to ensure fair play. The classic v1 protocol uses security deposits locked from both buyer and seller alongside the trade amount in a '''2-of-2 multisig escrow'''. Other protocols like Bisq Easy rely on seller reputation.\n* '''Dispute Resolution:''' If issues arise, a decentralized human dispute resolution system (including trader chat, mediation, and potentially arbitration) is available.\n\n## = How Bisq keeps data private\n=\n* '''No Registration/KYC:''' Using Bisq requires no identity verification or account registration with a central entity.\n* '''Tor Network:''' All peer-to-peer network communication runs over the Tor network by default, masking IP addresses.\n* '''No Central Servers:''' Bisq has no central databases storing user or trade data.\n* '''Encrypted Communication:''' Trade details are end-to-end encrypted between the trading counterparties.\n\n## = How Bisq resists censorship\n=\n* '''Distributed P2P Network:''' The network consists of users running the software globally, making it difficult for any single entity to shut down.\n* '''Built on Tor:''' Inherits Tor's own censorship resistance properties.\n* '''Code, Not a Company:''' Bisq is open-source software developed by a DAO, not a legal corporate entity that can be easily targeted or shut down by regulators.", "category": "bisq2"}

Security deposits are fully reimbursed automatically to both trading peers when the trade ends without disputes.\n\nSecurity deposits are the most important tool Bisq offers to protect honest traders. Furthermore, requiring ''both'' parties to post a deposit increases chances that they will be willing to cooperate and determine amicable outcomes in case a trade doesn't go according to plan.\n\nWhen a trade doesn't go the happy path, a portion or the total amount of the offending peer's deposit will be lost, depending on whether the trade is concluded in mediation or arbitration.

This can be inconvenient, but it's a core part of the security protocol.

Such mechanisms would only give a false sense of security anyway due to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attacks].\n\n## Recommended amounts\n\nBisq allows offer makers to choose a security deposit percentage: '''minimum is 15%''' of trade amount and '''maximum is 50%''' of trade amount (absolute minimum is 0.001 BTC). The offer taker must deposit the same amount as the offer maker.\n\nWhen creating an offer, Bisq recommends a security deposit based on recent volatility of the asset being traded: '''the higher the volatility, the higher the recommended security deposit'''.

This is because a USPMO is a bearer instrument—as long as the money order itself is valid, it doesn't matter who sent it or what the sender's address is.\n** Consider using an online name generator (search \"random name generator\" on your favorite search engine) for a more bias-free suggestion for the sender's name.\n** For the sender's address, you may want to be more careful, because if your envelope is returned, you'll want to be able to retrieve it.\n*** '''Option 1''' - Use an actual fake address (search internet for \"random address generator\"). If your envelope is returned for any reason, you'll probably lose it for good.\n*** '''Option 2''' - Use another address: that of a neighbor, a friend, or a nearby building (e.g., apartment leasing office, local mom-and-pop shop, etc). This way, you'll have a higher chance of retrieving a returned envelope, but you'll reveal a bit of information about your location.\n* If selling, name and address must be correct (address must be correct in order to receive the envelope, and name must match photo ID to cash it).\n* To maximize privacy, consider setting up 2 separate payment accounts: one with fake information for buying bitcoin and one with real information for selling bitcoin.\n\nAgain, please note that incorrect information in Bisq payment accounts is generally against Bisq trade protocol. Buying bitcoin with USPMO is a rare exception.\n\n= Buying the money order =\n\nIt is highly recommended to use cash to buy the USPMO. Using any other electronic form of payment adds a form of tracking to the transaction, which can defeat the purpose of using the USPMO in the first place.\n\nIf you're not buying more than $3,000 of money orders in a single day, the [https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/509.htm#ep1124357 USPS does not require photo ID]. If asked for ID, kindly remind your cashier that ID isn't required (perhaps you left it at home?).\n\nAlso consider:\n* asking for a printed receipt, in case of a dispute on Bisq\n* wearing sunglasses and/or a mask\n* placing the USPMO out of sight upon receiving it, and filling it out elsewhere (away from cameras)\n\n= Sending a money order in the mail =\n\n400px|thumb|right|Figure 1. Extra paper for extra privacy in the envelope.\n\nAddress the envelope as appropriate.\n\nWhen putting the money order in the envelope, consider adding a blank sheet of paper for an additional layer of privacy. Fold a blank sheet of paper in half twice (to form a “V” shape). Place the folded sheet in the envelope with the opening facing up. In between the “V” opening, place the USPMO (see Figure 1). This extra layer of paper makes it harder to see the envelope's contents from the outside.\n\nAfter dropping your money order in the mail, don't forget to mark your payment as sent in Bisq!\n\n= Redeeming a money order =\n\n## For cash\n\nIn order to redeem a money order for cash, you'll need to present photo identification that matches the name on the USPMO.\n\nKeep in mind that the cash you can receive may be limited to the amount of cash the cashier has in their drawer—to receive larger quantities of cash, you may need to go to different locations or go back at different times.\n\nOne user has reported a workaround involving spreading the transaction to other counters at the post office:\n\n<blockquote>The first time I visited the Post Office to \"cash out\" my money order someone sent me in Bisq, I think it was for the amount of $1,000 USD. The Teller told me she doesn't have that much money to help me redeem it. But then, instead of sending me away to my bank to deposit it there, she called out to her co-workers down the line, asking each of them how much each currently had in their drawer. Whereas she had (I forget the exact amounts now) maybe $200 in her drawer, the neighboring teller said she had $300 and the next Teller over said he had about $700. So, my Teller took my $1,000 money order, gave me the $200 in her drawer, printed me a new money order for the difference of $800, and sent me to see the next Teller. Then, that 2nd Teller accepted my $800 money order, gave me her $300 in her drawer, and printed me the difference of $500 as a new money order. Finally, the 3rd Teller used the $700 in his drawer to fully redeem my $500 money order. I had to hop three Tellers, one after another, paying the fee for each money order printed along the way, but I walked out of the Post Office with $1,000 cash in that one visit.</blockquote>\n\n## For new USPMOs\n\nAnother option is to redeem the USPMO you receive for another USPMO. Some cashiers will claim this isn't possible, but it is. Gently call a manager or colleague to help in case your cashier doesn't cooperate.\n\nWhy redeem a USPMO for another USPMO? Because a USPMO is almost as good as cash—you can mail USPMO to billers to pay bills (without banks!), for example.", "category": "bisq2"}

This means that when you privately trade on Bisq, you are most probably doing nothing wrong, on the contrary you are furthering the ideals Bitcoin was created for, even if someone might try to convince you otherwise.\n\nThere are parties though that would rather have Bitcoin either disappear, or be turned into the ultimate mass-control tool (the latter being a very realistic scenario, given the peculiarities of the blockchain and its workings). This might, in turn, lead these parties to act in such a way that Bitcoin itself doesn't prosper, or projects around it disappear completely.\n\nThis is not an advanced privacy/anonymity guide, but is rather tailored to Bisq contributors and their selective need for pseudonymity, which should not impact too much on convenience unless they cover very sensitive roles (in which case they are already prepared on the matter of personal security, and do not really need this guide anyway).\n\nBisq contributors, as key elements for Bisq's well being, might be among targeted individuals, and for this, other than for best practices regarding privacy on the internet, it is advisable they act accordingly, first and foremost for their own safety, and then for Bisq's.\n\nThe aim of this guide is containerization, which means that a ''contributor'' will appear to an ''adversary'' (someone trying to understand who you really are, to do bad things to you) as a specific individual, traceable online as ''contributor'', but hopefully (if you do things well enough) not linkable to their real identity, nor to other possible nyms ''contributor'' uses while participating in other projects.\nIn other words, ''adversary'' will be able to tell if something on the internet has been said by ''contributor'', but it should not make them any wiser about who ''contributor'' really is, where they live, or which other works they have done for other initiatives.\nWe will be making Tor Browser work as a much more convenient, much less privacy hardened browser, that will still force you to connect through Tor to do whatever you need; in other words, we will use Tor Browser in a way that it is NOT intended to be used. An adversary will be able to fingerprint you as a nym, but they won't find details to locate your real identity if you are careful; the previous statement will not be liked by enthusiasts of online privacy, but a mild yet consistent plan, is still much better than a very strong plan that is not adhered to 100% of the time because it is very unconvenient.\n\nLet's clear up some definitions:\n* privacy is when someone knows who you are, but not what you do\n* anonymity is when someone knows what you do, but not who you are\n* pseudonymity is when someone knows \"who\" you are and what you do, but the \"who\" is an imaginary identity that exists only in its own reality, without any ties to your real or alternative identities\n\nFor more info:\n* https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/pseudonymity-guide\n* https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html\n\n= Tenets =\n\n* I will have a Bisq nym, that will be the only one used for everything related to Bisq\n* My Bisq nym will be its own person, it will not be similar to, know about the existence of, or participate in the same chats/groups/forums/activities as my real or alternative identities\n* I will only use Tor for everything the Bisq nym does\n* I will endure the slowness of Tor, and will NOT use my real connection nor my faster VPN to do Bisq stuff\n\n= Steps for base setup =\n\n* download Tor Browser for your OS\n* have Tor Browser \"installed\" (actually it is just uncompressed in a folder with no ties to registry or system config) in a path that's unique to your Bisq nym\n* run Tor Browser (ignore the error about restarting Tor if there is another Tor Browser open, as they will try to bind the same ports, returning an error, and close the popup) and open <code>about:config</code> in the URL bar, say that you really want to access the options, then search for <code>_port</code>\n* you want to edit <code>network.proxy.socks_port</code> and <code>extensions.torlauncher.control_port</code>, the standard values here are respectively 9150 and 9151 (standalone tor daemon is 9050 and 9051), so you can change them to 9250 and 9251, or increase them to 9350 and 9351 if you want several Tor Browser instances running at the same time (this will run a dedicated Tor circuit builder for your Bisq activity)\n* still in about:config, search for \"privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing\" and set it to false (allows maximizing pages to fill the whole screen)\n* close Tor Browser and restart it (right after this, it's a good time to enable the automatic connection, which means Tor Browser will build a Tor circuit right after you start it)\n* go to geolocation.com in Tor Browser, verify the IP and location is different from your real ones (it will necessarily be, this is just to show you where you appear to be coming from, when using Tor) and from the one reported from any other Tor Browser you maybe already have on the system\n* make sure the shield icon in top right is empty (clicking on it says \"standard\"); this will enable scripts, which are not \"safe\" for anonymity, but you want a bit of convenience to be able to use Matrix and other websites that require javascript, as long as all activity in this browser stays within your Bisq nym\n* go to settings > privacy, and under \"history\" disable \"always use private browsing\", this will restart Tor Browser; after restart, return to same settings, disable cookie deletion after Tor Browser closes (so you can log back in to websites automatically), enable all logins&passwords saving, and under history enable what suits you (enable both \"remember\" for maximum convenience), then under Permissions, block requests to access camera and location. Even if you don't disable mic access, the microphone will still be unavailable during web calls, because of a compile-time setting of Tor Browser.\n\n## Tips\n\n* sometimes Tor will become slow, really, unbearably torturing slow; stay strong, don't go clearnet; if all else fails, blame Tor with your correspondents, it will immediately excuse you for your unresponsiveness, and at the same time show you are very privacy-oriented and make you look really cool\n* the usual tip to leave the tor browser window at default size is not really needed here, as we are okay with \"fingerprinting\" the nym\n* sometimes the Tor connection will degrade to a point where it's not useable, and you need to create a new Tor circuit; do NOT, EVER click \"New Identity\" to do this, or you will lose every personalization (pinned tabs and history mainly), rather close Tor Browser and restart it\n\n= Known issues and warnings =\n\n* real anonymity does not exist, even if you could \"plug\" into the internet like rebels plugged into the Matrix, someone could still be able to trace the source of your \"signal\"; proper personal protection can be achieved based on one's dedication and skills, and always relative to one's threat model (a Bisq contributor shouldn't get the same attention that a whistleblower does, for example)\n* it only takes one mistake, where you let a hint to your real identity slip through your pseudonym, and your whole nym is compromised, plus all of their past activity will be linked to you\n* assume any online service will keep all the information about you that you allow it to obtain (browser/PC information via javascript, OS preferred language, obviously your IP, cookies...) and store them for the long term even after you think you deleted them\n* assume that anything you do, say, or write, will be used against you, even if it was innocent and apparently inconsequential at the time\n* in the above configuration, Tor Browser loses most of its specific privacy strengths, yet it's still very useful to have a portable, containerized browser that will only work through Tor, and builds its own Tor connection, distinct from any other Tor daemon you maybe have on your system (versus, for example, using several chromium instances tied to the same Tor proxy, which will all use the same entry and exit node, and which will be at risk of going on clearnet if for any reason the plugin you use to proxy through Tor doesn't do its job)\n* this guide is only aimed at online protection, offering nothing in the compartment of offline security: anyone physically accessing your PC will be able to tell that you are, in fact, ''contributor'', plus any other identity you might have used online, unless you also hardened your system with additional layers that will not be covered in this guide, at least for now (see Tails, Qubes, Whonix, or any other renowned tool for PC protection)\n\n= Steps for accounts setup =\nAs a Bisq contributor, you will need at minimum a GitHub account, to be able to publish Compensation Requests. A GitHub account requires an email address, so you will need that one as well.\nProtonmail is one email provider that will let you register -as of now- without any KYC elements (no other email addresses nor phone numbers needed); riseup.net also offers no-kyc email, but you need an invite by another user; in case you know of similar services, please notify us and we will gladly add them in this guide.\nAn account on matrix is also advised to access Bisq's space, you will register from https://bisq.chat and use the same email to associate to that account, registering at https://bisq.community is needed to interact with the forum.\nAn interesting customization can be to obtain an AI generated face to associate with your account, there are many services that let you get such a picture for free.\n\n= Burning Men considerations =\n\nIf a Bisq contributor wants to become act as one of the Burning Ben they will have additional privacy and opsec considerations.\n\n* BSQ is inherently less private than bitcoin. BSQ can easily be traced back to a compensation request, DAO vote.\n* Bitcoin accumulated from performing the role of a burning man also links it to a specific burning man address.\n\nBoth of the above points should be considered by contributors concerned about privacy and opsec.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Burning Men", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\n'''Burning Men''' is the name given to Bisq contributors who choose to burn BSQ in order to receive bitcoin from Bisq trading activity: Trade fees and Delayed payout transactions. It's an evolution of the previous 'burning man' role. The change, implemented since January 2023 in this [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 proposal], aimed to increase Bisq's decentralization by distributing this role within many contributors. A single burning man could have gone missing, ran away with the BTC before trading them for BSQ and burning these BSQ, or could have been otherwise compromised.<br>\nAs each burning men burns an undetermined amount of BSQ as a condition to receive a share of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, trust requirements and single points of failure are almost nonexistent.\nPlease note: The burningmen protocol described here is entirely different from burns made in Bisq 2 for increasing reputation. Burns made in Bisq 2 do not affect the burningmen protocol.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Contributing as a Burningmen =\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThere are two ways to contribute as a Burningmen. Since the system is not exempt of trust requirements, burningmen need to have provided value to Bisq in the past:\n\n* Contributors who received compensation for their contributions within the last 24 cycles.\n* Contributors who received a BSQ from the DAO genesis transaction.\n\nAfter burning some BSQ (it does not matter if they were previously earned or bought in the BSQ market) they will get a share percentage in the distribution of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions. The more value they've provided to Bisq, the bigger the portion of BSQ they are allowed to burn.\n\n## Considerations before burning BSQ\n\nBurningmen seek profit from burning BSQ, otherwise they would keep their BSQ or sell them for BTC at the market. But profit, coming from estimating the amount of BSQ to burn now to receive a share of future Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, is not granted. There are many sources of uncertainty:\n* Trading volume: affected by BTC trend, Bisq competitors, mining fees, etc.\n* Changes to trade protocol: traders could burn more or less BSQ directly, Delayed payout transactions could be reduced considerably.\n* BSQ/BTC price volatility.\n* BSQ burnt by competing Burningmen.\n\nSince the launch of the Burningmen protocol up to the moment of this writing (Cycle 61), more bitcoin has been distributed to the Burningmen than the bitcoin equivalent amount of BSQ that has been burnt. This means that, historically, burning BSQ has been profitable for most contributors. <br>\nAlthough Bisq provides an estimation of BSQ to burn based in the past, each of the Burningmen should estimate their risk/reward scenarios based in their predictions. Becoming a Burningmen is optional. Depending on how they value the BSQ they have now, the BTC they can obtain on the future, or even if they just want to help Bisq grow, they will not burn BSQ at all, burn all the BSQ from their compensation requests or even buy more BSQ to burn up to their limit. <br>\nThe less competition between Burningmen there is, the more profitable it will be for each of them, and vice versa. The less profitable Burningmen role is, the better for the DAO, as more BSQ is burnt, reducing or containing BSQ supply and therefore pressuring its price up.\n\n= Burning BSQ and receiving BTC =\n\n## Contributors\n\nWhen doing their compensation request, a contributor should fill the \"Burningman receiving address\" with a BTC address to receive the funds to. Once the compensation request is approved, that address will be used for any burning men payouts they receive up until they ever change it in a subsequent approved compensation request. If that field is never completed, an address from Bisq wallet will be used as receiving address. <br>\nIt is highly recommended to use an external wallet like electrum or sparrow, which are able to handle many UTXOs and can connect to a signing device for cold storage.\n\nTo burn BSQ for the BSQ burning man role the current contributor will see their assigned name 'contributor_name' in the Burningmen Protocol UI. They can then choose to burn an amount of BSQ and press burn. <br>\nSince ''Issuance share'' is capped depending on how many BTC were earned in the last 2 years (decaying linearly) it's important to make sure that the amount of BTC to burn will not exceed the cap. It would be prudent to begin with small amounts and never exceed the lower amount in the ''burn target'' column.\n\n## Receivers of the genesis distribution\n\nIf a contributor has funds from the genesis output(s) in their Bisq wallet they will see their assigned name 'Bisq co founder XX' in the Burningmen Protocol UI. They should chose the BTC address to receive funds and follow the instructions in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390#issuecomment-1306075295 github proposal].\n\nBurning BSQ works as described in the second paragraph at contributors section.\n\n= Burning Men Protocol UI =\n\nThe user interface to interact with the Burning Men User protocol user interface can be found at <code>DAO > Proof of Burn > Burning Men</code>.\n\n## Burning Men Candidates fields\n\n* Contributor name: Always use the same name as per github handle when doing compensation requests to avoid duplicated similar contributors with different names and shares.\n* Burn target: Click the <code>?</code> icon to get more info. Take these numbers as broad estimates and do not use the one on the right as your cap will be exceeded. Even using the left value could make you reach your cap. Do not make decisions based on what to burn on these numbers alone.\n* Receiver share: It informs about the % chance of receiving a trade fee and % amount of the delayed payout transactions you'll receive. It's updated every block and changes based on who burns BSQ '''and''' the decay over time of the burns made by the burningmen. Each BSQ burnt amount decays linearly to zero over 12 months. To protect the DAO from an attack from a malicious contributor who self trades sending their trades to arbitration, the maximum share each contributor can get is 11%, no matter how many BSQ they burn.\n* Issuance share: It's the amount of BSQ compensation each contributor has received over the last 24 cycles, decaying linearly. Recent contributions have a higher weight. It bears maximum receiver share. A burning man can get a receiver share of up to 10 times their issuance share amount, up to a maximum of 11%. A 0.7% percent issuance share will limit the receiver share to 7%.\n* Burned amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by contributor over time\n* Decayed burn amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by the contributor when taking into account the decay their burns have over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the 'receiver share' value and changes every block.\n* Issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor over time.\n* Decayed issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor when taking into account the decay over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the 'issuance share' value.\n\n## Profit fields\n\nWhen selecting a burningmen, individual profit stats are displayed. It can be filtered by burning, trading fee and/or DPT eventsand by month or individual events. Looking at monthly profits can be used as an indicator of how many BSQ to burn. Note that it's normal to have a negative profit at the beginning, since receiver shares decay linearly over 12 cycles. A burning man should not expect to regain in one month what will be distributed during a longer period. <br>\nScrolling down at the _Profit_ table, it's possible to export all burningman data from a contributor by clicking <code>export to CSV</code>.\n\n## DAO fields\n\nIt gives an overview of BSQ burning and bitcoin distribution across all DAO contributors.\n\n* Total amount of burned BSQ: All time amount of BSQ that has been burnt by all contributors acting as burning men.\n* Total amount of distributed BTC/BSQ: All time amount of bitcoin that has been distributed to all contributors acting as burning men. For ease of comparison this figure is also given as a BSQ amount.\n* Export to CSV: To see the results by month rather than all time in a CSV file, getting a more granular data.\n\nIf the amount of BSQ being distributed is greater than the amount being burnt then the burning men are generally in profit from their activities. If the amount of BSQ being distributed is less than the amount being burnt then the burning men are in a loss from their activities.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Funding your wallet", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBefore trading on Bisq, it's necessary to '''fund your wallet''' with bitcoin. This is because making and taking offers on Bisq requires traders to post a security deposit and pay fees with bitcoin.\n\nPosting bitcoin security deposits in a 2of2 multisignature address is part of what makes trading on Bisq highly secure.\n\n## Security Deposit Requirements\n\n\nYou can see the required deposits for an offer by clicking on the <code>i</code> icon for an offer. You'll see a pop-up appear. On the bottom of this pop-up will be a <code>Details</code> section with a <code>Security Deposit</code> line.\n\n<br clear=all>\n\nframeless|left|600px\n\n<br clear=all>\n\n## = For Buyers\n=\n\nBuyers need to post a deposit of at least 15% of the trade amount, with an absolute minimum of 0.001 BTC. The maximum possible deposit for a buyer is 50% of the trade amount. The offer maker sets this percentage when creating an offer.\n\n## = For Sellers\n=\n\nSellers need to post a deposit of 15% of the trade amount with an absolute minimum of 0.001 BTC (in addition to 100% of the bitcoin being sold). As of this writing, the security deposit percentage for sellers cannot be adjusted.\n\n## = Notes for Buyers and Sellers\n=\n\nIf the size of an offer is a range, the required security deposit is calculated according to the maximum possible trade size. Example: if the buyer's deposit is set to 20% for an offer with a 0.05-0.10 BTC trade size, the buyer will need to post a 0.02 BTC security deposit. The seller would need to post a deposit of 0.015 BTC (for a total deposit of 0.115 BTC, since they'd also have to post the entire ''possible'' trade amount).\n\n## How to Obtain Your First Bitcoin\n\n\nIf you don’t already own any bitcoin, you’ll need to obtain some—ideally, as privately and securely as possible.\n\nHow much do you need? In addition to covering a security deposit (as described above), traders also need to cover mining fees and trading fees. Estimates for both are shown in the interface when making or taking an offer. As of this writing, a safe estimate for buying your first bitcoin on Bisq with fiat is '''0.002 BTC'''.\n\nHere are some ideas for how to do that.\n\nthumb|right|A graphical overview of how to get your first bitcoin privately.\n\n* '''Bisq Easy'''. Bisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2 that allows users to buy bitcoin with no trade fees and no security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol. It is meant for bitcoin buyers with limited experience using peer to peer software to purchase no KYC bitcoin and to be smoothly on-boarded by experienced and helpful bitcoin sellers.\n* '''Matrix room'''. Bisq's Matrix chat offers a <code>Get your first BTC</code> room for trusted and bonded Bisq users to sell first-time Bisq users their first BTC so they can use Bisq.\n* '''Friends and family'''. Simply buy a small amount of bitcoin directly from someone you trust.\n* '''Bitcoin ATM'''. Some bitcoin ATMs don't require ID for smaller purchases, and some don't require any ID at all. You can find bitcoin ATMs in your area on [https://coinatmradar.com/ Coin ATM Radar].\n* '''Sell something'''. Do you offer a product or service? Use BTCPayServer to collect BTC for it! Otherwise don't forget about local marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace—many people are willing to buy and sell everyday goods for BTC.\n* '''Work for it'''. While sites to find gigs that pay in bitcoin never really panned out, it may not hurt to let a client or business contact know that you also accept bitcoin for payment.\n* '''Meetups'''. People at bitcoin meetups might have bitcoin. Crazy, right? Find out where and when they take place on Meetup, Twitter, and other places where people talk about bitcoin.\n* '''Vouchers'''. Companies like [https://fastbitcoins.com/ Fastbitcoins.com] and [https://azte.co/ Azte.co] may sell vouchers at physical stores in your area for cash. There aren't a whole lot of locations yet, but more are being added all the time.\n\nIt's highly recommended that you avoid using a corporate, centralized exchange to get your first bitcoin. Most such exchanges (like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc) require a significant amount of personal information, putting you at risk by tying your identity to your bitcoin (as well as by storing all this information in databases with that of others, forming what are commonly referred to as \"honeypots\"—highly attractive targets for hackers). Also, since bitcoin transactions are public and easily traceable, any future transactions involving bitcoin purchased with these services can be traced back to you.\n\nBisq is built from the ground up to avoid this privacy fiasco, so we strongly recommend avoiding centralized exchanges.\n\n## Sending Bitcoin to your Bisq wallet\n\nOnce you’ve gotten enough bitcoin for your security deposit and fees, you can move it into Bisq’s built-in wallet. This isn’t strictly required, but it’ll make trading more convenient since the funds you need to accept an offer will be readily available when you need them.\n\nTo send bitcoin to your Bisq wallet, you'll need an address. You'll find one on <code>Funds</code> > <code>Receive Funds</code>.\n\nYou might see many addresses listed. Pick the address on the bottom next to the QR code.\n\n600px|thumb|left|Find your Bisq wallet's receiving address. </br>\nCheck or uncheck ''Native segwit format (Bech32)'' to receive funds to a legacy address.\n\nCategory:Use Cases", "category": "bisq2"}

The [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room offers one possible way to get this initial bitcoin without signing up for a centralized exchange.\n\nOther solutions are listed at Funding your wallet.\n\n## Risks\n\nMake sure you understand these risks before trading:\n\n* Not entirely anonymous - Unless you access through Tor, IP address and other usage metrics may reveal your identity\n* Must trust traders - Trades are not secured by deposits as they are on Bisq\n* No dispute resolution - Trades depend solely on user reputation, so there's no recourse if something goes wrong\n\n## Trading rules\n\nTo maximize the chances that trades go smoothly, the following rules apply:\n\n* Maximum trade size is ''0.007'' BTC. BTC buyers can buy a maximum of 0.007 BTC in one transaction. BTC sellers can sell a maximum of 0.007 BTC in one transaction.\n* Traders can negotiate their prices. Sellers of BTC will likely charge a high premium to cover mining fees, time, and profit.\n* BTC buyers should post on the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room the amount they are looking to buy, the payment method they are looking to use, and which currency they wish to make payment in: for example, \"I am looking to buy 0.007 BTC with GBP using Revolut. Is anyone online willing to take this offer?\"\n* Trades between interested parties can be negotiated and settled in direct messages.\n* Only payment methods used in Bisq are allowed. Preference should be given to those with immediate payment: e.g. Revolut, TransferWise, SEPA Instant, Zelle, Faster Payments etc.\n* '''There are no refunds, no mediation, no arbitration, and no dispute resolution of any kind available.''' Beware!\n* DAO compensation requests or reimbursement requests related to such trades are not allowed.\n* Any trader can be kicked out of the room at the discretion of the room owner. The [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room is moderated to preclude foul play and bad actors.\n\n## Considerations\n\nAs you are potentially linking your Matrix username to your payment account you might want to consider using a Matrix throwaway account for increased privacy.\n\nAdditionally, if you're not confident in the reputation of a trader, it may be a good idea to split a trade into multiple installments. This will reduce your losses if a trader disappears after payment, but should be weighed against transaction fees. If you are trading fiat, also consider the risk of a bank finding multiple transactions more suspicious than a single large purchase.\n\nIf a trader isn't comfortable with multiple installments, it's most likely out of their control, and you may want to find another trader or an alternative payment method. As always, you are doing this at your own risk; make sure to consider someone's track record to determine how cautious you should be. A trader that has consistently delivered positive results is more trustworthy than someone who hasn't completed any trades yet.\n\nIf a trader has treated you well, leaving a positive review in chat will help others with their own evaluation of that trader; likewise, if you have a bad experience with a trader, don't be afraid to leave a negative review, even if there is a possibility that it could've been accidental.", "category": "bisq2"}

{"title": "Arbitration", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\n'''Arbitration''' refers to the last stage of the dispute resolution process—it's what takes place in case trader chat and mediation fail to resolve a dispute.\n\nThis page first covers the arbitration process itself, in a practical sense, so that users can be made aware of what to expect when trading. Then it covers the process in more detail, including its motivations, how all the components work together, and how the process is expected to develop in the future.\n\n## Process\n\nBisq's arbitration process is a thoroughly decentralized approach to handling disputes between 2 strangers on the internet: one in which no user needs to trust a third party with authority over their funds, but one in which a user can still expect a satisfactory outcome if they have followed the Bisq trading rules.\n\nArbitration is only available when:\n\n* one or both traders reject a mediator’s suggested payout\n* the time-locked delayed payout transaction is published\n\nA ''time-locked delayed payout transaction'' is signed (but not published) at the beginning of the trade process. Its purpose is to allow time for traders and mediators to work out a payout using the funds in the 2-of-2 multisig escrow, and to eliminate the possibility of fraud in case they can't.\n\nRequesting arbitration publishes this time-locked transaction, sending all funds in the multisig escrow (i.e., those of both trading peers) to the Bisq \"donation addresses\" (which are owned by the Burning Men, Bisq contributors who burn BSQ in advance). This transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for altcoin trades) and 20 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for fiat trades), which means arbitration is only available after this time has passed.\n\nBurning Men burn BSQ after estimating how many BTC from trading fees and delayed payouts will be during a cycle, and a filter controlled by the DAO distributes the BTC in proportion to how many BSQ have been burned. This keeps BSQ supply balanced, allowing for a corresponding amount of new BSQ to be issued to account for the BTC payouts made to traders as part of arbitration. As a result, BSQ supply is largely unaffected.\n\nThis dynamic essentially enables a sort of mutually assured destruction to drive dispute resolution on Bisq without trusted third parties.\n\n'''In plain language, here's how the process works for traders:'''\n\n# If you’re dissatisfied with the mediator’s suggestion and think you are entitled to a better outcome, request arbitration when it's available (doing so publishes the time-locked transaction and sends funds to the donation addresses owned by the Burning Men).\n# Collaborate with an arbitrator to clarify the details of your case.\n# If the arbitrator agrees you are owed BTC, they will pay it to you.\n# The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO so they are not out of pocket.\n\nTakeaway: if you are owed BTC after a dispute, you'll get it from an arbitrator who will refund you with their own funds. The arbitrator then requests reimbursement from the Bisq DAO usually once per DAO cycle and asks for the BSQ amount as a reimbursement for the BTC they have refunded Bisq traders. .\n\n## Process, In Detail\n\nTo better understand arbitration, we need to first understand the new trade protocol, and how it improves upon the old trade protocol.\n\n## = Pre v1.2 Trade Protocol\n=\n\nThe previous model with 2-of-3 multisig deposit transactions (where an arbitrator was the 3rd key holder, and makes the payout to one of the traders in dispute cases) carried a significant risk: if the arbitrator was malicious (or was hacked), he could have taken all offers with a sockpuppet trader and made the payouts right back to his own sockpuppet.\n\nThis risk made it impossible to scale dispute resolution and find more arbitrators—we were limited to filling the role with a tiny number of Bisq contributors who could be 100% trusted to not be malicious and who had a good enough background in computer security to make getting hacked highly unlikely.\n\nThis element was the single most problematic element in Bisq’s old trade protocol, but since there weren’t any better solutions, we used it for as long as we had to.\n\n## = Post 1.2 Trade Protocol\n=\n\nThe new trade protocol, launched in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.0 Bisq v1.2], eliminates the risks described above to a large extent by separating functions and involving the DAO. It significantly improves censorship-resistance, security, and scalability of dispute resolution on Bisq.\n\nthumb|right|Dispute resolution for trade protocol (v1.2+).\n\nThe basic change is that it uses a 2-of-2 multisig in the deposit transaction with only the traders’ keys.\n\nOn the happy path, the traders each sign the payout tx once the fiat or altcoin is transferred.\n\nIf anything goes wrong, there are 3 stages to resolve the issue:\n\n# The traders can have a direct chat where they can try to find a solution to their problem.\n# If that does not succeed either trader can open a mediation ticket and request help from a mediator. Mediators play a role similar to that of arbitrators in the old model, except they don’t have a 3rd key. They only can make a ''suggestion'' for the payout distribution, which either trader is free to accept or reject. If both traders accept, they create and sign the payout tx and the trade is completed. If either trader rejects, the dispute goes to stage 3. This escalation can only take place after a certain time period has passed. For altcoins, this period is 10 days, and for fiat it’s 20 days.\n# An arbitrator will investigate the case, just like a mediator would, and decide how a payout should be distributed. The arbitrator role currently has 2 parts: supreme mediator and refund agent (this is where the term ''refund agent'' comes from, but ''arbitrator'' is a better term for the role, as we will soon see). The supreme mediator part of the role is similar in function to that of a regular mediator (i.e., investigate a dispute). The refund agent reimburses traders BTC for disputed trades without requiring them to undergo the complex and time-consuming process of making a reimbursement request in the DAO. The ultimate goal, however, is to make such extreme dispute cases so ''rare'' that requiring users to request reimbursement from the DAO on their own becomes feasible (e.g., by reducing bugs, UX improvements, increasing security deposits, etc). But we’re not there yet, so for now, an arbitrator simply decides on a payout ''and'' funds this payout from their own pocket, and later makes a reimbursement request to the DAO to be reimbursed for their reimbursement to the user. To avoid potential fraud, and to keep the DAO from losing money in each arbitration case, we use the donation address to receive the funds from the trade via the time-locked delayed payout payout tx.\n\n## = Time-Locked Delayed Payout Payout Transaction\n=\nSince [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.8 v1.9.8], traders create a time-locked delayed payout payout tx where all the locked up funds (trade amount + both security deposits) are sent to Bisq donation address owners, also known as burningmen. These addresses are defined in the DAO. The burningmen are Bisq contributors who burn their BSQ in order to get a portion of time-locked delayed payouts and trading fees paid in BTC.\nFrom v1.2 to v1.9.8, this address was controlled by a single burning man who exchanged BTC for BSQ to burn them afterwards. That supposed a risk for the DAO as, although the burningman had to place a BSQ bond, the amount of the bond was lower than the amount of expected BTC to collect. Distributing the role into multiple burningman and requiring them to burn BSQ in advance, this risk has significantly decreased.\n\nIf a trade is not completed in 10 days (for altcoins) or 20 days (for fiat), either of the 2 traders have a chance (after mediation) to publish the time-locked payout tx where all deposit funds are sent to the donation address, requiring the aggrieved trader to request arbitration so they can receive a payout. With the preliminary solution we use now, the trader gets a payout from an arbitrator directly, '''but the eventual goal is that the arbitrator makes a suggestion which the DAO uses as a basis for voting on the reimbursement request made by the trader(s)'''.\n\n## = Avoiding Fraud\n=\n\nThe time-locked delayed payout payout tx is essential to avoid fraud. A trader could make a self-trade and then claim that his “peer” has not paid. Without the time-locked payout tx, he could go through the dispute process, make a reimbursement request, and receive BSQ for the equivalent “lost” funds in BTC. After that he could make the payout to himself from the trade, since he controls both “traders”—thereby scamming the DAO with the trade amount.\n\nTo avoid this fraud, we require that locked up funds in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx are spent before opening an arbitration ticket. Thus it is not possible for a trader to defraud the DAO in the way described above.\n\n## = Donation Address Owners (burningmen)\n=\n\nBurningmen are current and past contributors who earned BSQ by contributing to Bisq who opt to to burn their BSQ to get BTC from time-locked delayed payout transactions and trading fees paid in BTC. A DAO filter distributes the BTC in proportion to their relative amount of BSQ burned. The amount of BSQ to be burned is limited for each contributor, to prevent that a single burningman could create self trades and take advantage from being refunded at arbitration and receiving BTC from the DAO filter as well. In order to keep this system safe, it is required that refund agent does not reimburse a security deposit from deposit transaction.\nThe amount of BSQ to be burned (burn target) is estimated from accumulated reimbursement requests, trade fees paid in BTC and burned BSQ from burningmen in the last 12 months.\nThe BSQ burned and BTC sent to burningmen should balance over time. Each one of the burningmen, according to their prefferences, could try to \"charge\" a discount rate for the risk assumed advancing their BSQ to the DAO by burning less than the burning target, or they could try to \"pay\" to avoid selling big volumes of BSQ to a low liquid market by overburning (up to 100.000 BSQ over the burning target). They could also under or overestimate the amount of BTC to be received over the next year, which is the period that burned amounts decay linearly: the burn target is an estimation with data from the past.\nDAO contributors have another way to turn BSQ into BTC while contributing to remove the legacy burningman, which was a central point of failure for the Bisq DAO and created distorsion as a big BSQ buyer. Some burningmen will require to buy BSQ to be burned eventually. The impact for the market will be reduced as there will be multiple interested parties.\n\nLet’s make a simple example to clarify:\n\n* Two traders are engaged in a 1 BTC trade, with 0.15 BTC each locked in a security deposit\n* 1.3 BTC is locked in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx (ignoring miner fees)\n* Assume BSQ/BTC is trading at 0.0001 (for easy calculations)\n\nAfter the required time passes, and the mediation process is closed, one of the traders opens an arbitration case. By doing so, the 1.3 BTC is sent to donation addresses (controlled by the burning men). This transaction was signed by both traders at the time the offer was taken, but was time-locked so it was invalid until the required time had passed. The arbitrator investigates the case and makes a 1.15 BTC payout to the winning trader. He pays this sum from his personal wallet (pre-financing).\n\nWe assume that burningmen know there will be only one delayed payout during a cycle: burningmen burned 12,000 BSQ and received the 1.3 BTC into different addresses (which generates a 0.1 BTC profit), each one receiving a % based on the amount they've burned.\nThe arbitrator then makes a reimbursement request of 11,500 BSQ to settle his pre-financing. When approved, the DAO issues 11,500 BSQ to the arbitrator. The 0.1 BTC profit for burningmen was subsidized with the 0.15 BTC from the unpaid security deposit. The DAO keeps the other 0.5 BTC in form of reduction in BSQ supply of 0.05 BTC.\nArbitrator will have to burn or sell the BSQ the reimbursed BSQ to get BTC for new payments and reduce volatility risk, which is taking a high risk as they pre-finance the reimbursement. Bisq tries to make arbitration rare as reimbursing traders has a big cost.\n\n## = Why We Cannot Merge the Arbitrator and Burning Man Roles\n=\n\nThe separation of these roles is essential to keep the system flexible, censorship-resistant, and scalable.\n\n'''Keep in mind that the current dual role of arbitrators (i.e., supreme mediator and refund agent) is not the ultimate goal'''. The refund agent part of the role should be delegated to traders once the trade process is improved to a level where such cases rarely happen. How to keep the burden for traders low, and how to compensate them for this extra work—these items are still up for discussion (e.g. the trader could get a slight bonus if he does the reimbursement himself). A preferred option is to keep trader-submitted reimbursement requests optional and still offer arbitrator-funded reimbursements for a fee. The role could even be split, such that a market of refund agents develops where each agent offers their pre-financing services at different prices. But before getting into any of these discussions, we need to reduce bugs and improve UX.\n\nThe role of the burning man has been distributed between different contributors and a part of their earnings come directly as BTC, but it could also disappear when we have very few dispute cases, and once trade fees in BTC do not add up to a large amount. We could use the donation address to support critical infrastructure we use like Tor. Or we could use it to fund Bisq projects like the mobile wallet. There are many possibilities for how we could use these funds—but if we merged the burning man role with the arbitrator role, we would lose this flexibility.\n\nThe risks of the 2 roles are very different. An arbitrator does not present any severe risk to the DAO, actually, he ''takes on'' a lot of risk. A single burning man, on the other hand, is a trusted role and there is an open problem that a malicious burning man could make many trades, go to the arbitrator, get payouts, and then run away with the funds he received from the donation address. The high bond is a partial protection, but ultimately, this is a trusted role and only highly trusted Bisq contributors can take it on. This problem has been mitigated by distributing the role between different contributors with a cap on how much BTC they can get. So scalability is a small issue with the distributed burningmen, but we cannot say the same about the arbitrator. With more traders, there will be more cases, and we might need more arbitrators. Furthermore, with more regional expansion, we will need arbitrators with particular language skills. When arbitrators and burningmen are not combined into one role, we can add arbitrators to support this growth without posing high risk to the Bisq network. If we merged both roles, we would not be able to do this. There is a risk arbitrators expose to the DAO: they could fake their reporting, but this is likely solvable (traders can provide evidence).\n\nAnother important aspect is that arbitrator reimbursement is not automated. DAO stakeholders have ultimate power. Sure, they would probably lose an arbitrator if they don’t reimburse him fairly, and it might be hard to find new arbitrators after unfair behaviour from DAO stakeholders. But it is highly important that stakeholders be able to exercise absolute power.\n\nAnother consideration: if the process to reimburse arbitrators were automated, the result would probably involve legal risks that we want to avoid. The role would then adopt elements of a custodial function, and that would likely trigger regulatory issues.\n\n## = FAQ\n=\n\n'''What are the conditions that lead to a payout, for example, a dispute between Bob and Alice that is not resolved by normal mediation and gets escalated to arbitration?'''\n\nAfter the time-lock period (10 days for altcoins and 20 days for fiat), and after mediation is completed, either trader can open an arbitration ticket. Doing so publishes the time-locked delayed payout transaction.\n\n'''How are Bob and Alice's BTC funds paid out to the Bisq donation addresses?'''\n\nThe time-locked payout transaction is created and signed in the take-offer process and stored by both traders. The trade protocol requires this transaction to be in place before a trade is started.\n\n'''How is the arbitrator responsible for deciding what the payout distribution should be? Are facts and circumstances of the case taken into account? And how is this similar to legacy arbitration?'''\n\nIn terms of determining what a payout should be, an arbitrator's role is the same as that of a mediator. They'll ask you for any additional information they need to determine the facts and circumstances of the case. The only practical difference between arbitration and legacy arbitration is that arbitrators use their own funds to pay trader(s) instead of funds from the trading escrow.\n\n'''How, upon deciding a payout, does an arbitrator pay the BTC to Bob and Alice?'''\n\nArbitrators need to have enough BTC to cover potential payouts (up to 0.5 BTC per trade) — it's a requirement for anyone seeking to hold the role. An arbitration case can only be closed once an arbitrator makes a payout. Then, at the end of the DAO cycle, they'll get reimbursed with BSQ (which they can then sell for BTC).\n\n'''Are there any trades the arbitrator will not pay out? '''\n\nArbitrators will only reimburse trades in which the multisig deposit has been sent to the Bisq donation addresses. For trades requiring large reimbursements (above 0.5 BTC) they should be aware the arbitrators will only [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/296 partially reimburse traders up to 0.5 BTC]. Should a trader require a reimbursement over 0.5 BTC they can make a reimbursement request directly to the DAO on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support support repository].\n\n'''How does the arbitrator issue a reimbursement request for an amount of BSQ equivalent to the amount of BTC paid out-of-pocket to settle disputes?'''\n\nThis process is a work in progress. Currently we try to reduce volatility and exposure risk by converting pre-financed BTC to BSQ as fast as possible. Once it is BSQ there is no longer any volatility risk, and the arbitrator simply sums up all pre-financed BSQ and requests reimbursement. The public result of an arbitrator's work is a reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO.\n\n'''How does the DAO issue this BSQ to reimburse arbitrators?'''\n\nA reimbursement request is technically the same as a compensation request. DAO stakeholders vote on an arbitrator's request. The arbitrator needs to provide solid reporting to make their request transparent to the DAO. Currently there is some trust involved, since it cannot be proven that the arbitrator is not adding fake cases. This may be solvable by collecting data from traders, but this requires more thought.\n\n'''Doesn't this dispute resolution mechanism incentivize Bisq to have more trades go to arbitration, since disputed BTC funds are sent to the burningmen, and thereby benefit BSQ holders and themselves?'''\n\nIt's the traders who open arbitration, the DAO can't start arbitration, although it could generate bugs and be unresponsive at mediation. In this case, traders will be fully reimbursed (which will generate a loss for the DAO, as arbitrator charges for every arbitration case) if they have done enough reporting the issue and trying to get support through Matrix or Github.\nBugs and requiring arbitration is a bad user experience, so the DAO is also incentivized to keep arbitration and mediation cases at the minimum.\n\n'''How does an arbitrator spends their newly-issued BSQ?\n\nThe arbitrator sells BSQ for BTC from the market and burns BSQ as soon as reimbursement request is paid.\n\n'''How does the burningman burn the BSQ they earn or buy?'''\n\nBurning is done inside the Bisq software on <code>DAO / Burning / Burningmen</code>.\n\n'''Why not simply combine the burning man and arbitrator roles?'''\n\nSee longer explanation above. In short: to stay flexible, to be able to implement the target vision (reimbursement done by traders themselves), to avoid legal risks, to keep the arbitrator role scalable, and to address the trust/security issue with the current burning man model.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "bisq2"}

{"title": "Arbitration", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\n'''Arbitration''' refers to the last stage of the dispute resolution process—it's what takes place in case trader chat and mediation fail to resolve a dispute.\n\nThis page first covers the arbitration process itself, in a practical sense, so that users can be made aware of what to expect when trading. Then it covers the process in more detail, including its motivations, how all the components work together, and how the process is expected to develop in the future.\n\n## Process\n\nBisq's arbitration process is a thoroughly decentralized approach to handling disputes between 2 strangers on the internet: one in which no user needs to trust a third party with authority over their funds, but one in which a user can still expect a satisfactory outcome if they have followed the Bisq trading rules.\n\nArbitration is only available when:\n\n* one or both traders reject a mediator’s suggested payout\n* the time-locked delayed payout transaction is published\n\nA ''time-locked delayed payout transaction'' is signed (but not published) at the beginning of the trade process. Its purpose is to allow time for traders and mediators to work out a payout using the funds in the 2-of-2 multisig escrow, and to eliminate the possibility of fraud in case they can't.\n\nRequesting arbitration publishes this time-locked transaction, sending all funds in the multisig escrow (i.e., those of both trading peers) to the Bisq \"donation addresses\" (which are owned by the Burning Men, Bisq contributors who burn BSQ in advance). This transaction can only be published 10 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for altcoin trades) and 20 days after the deposit transaction is confirmed (for fiat trades), which means arbitration is only available after this time has passed.\n\nBurning Men burn BSQ after estimating how many BTC from trading fees and delayed payouts will be during a cycle, and a filter controlled by the DAO distributes the BTC in proportion to how many BSQ have been burned. This keeps BSQ supply balanced, allowing for a corresponding amount of new BSQ to be issued to account for the BTC payouts made to traders as part of arbitration. As a result, BSQ supply is largely unaffected.\n\nThis dynamic essentially enables a sort of mutually assured destruction to drive dispute resolution on Bisq without trusted third parties.\n\n'''In plain language, here's how the process works for traders:'''\n\n# If you’re dissatisfied with the mediator’s suggestion and think you are entitled to a better outcome, request arbitration when it's available (doing so publishes the time-locked transaction and sends funds to the donation addresses owned by the Burning Men).\n# Collaborate with an arbitrator to clarify the details of your case.\n# If the arbitrator agrees you are owed BTC, they will pay it to you.\n# The arbitrator will then request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO so they are not out of pocket.\n\nTakeaway: if you are owed BTC after a dispute, you'll get it from an arbitrator who will refund you with their own funds. The arbitrator then requests reimbursement from the Bisq DAO usually once per DAO cycle and asks for the BSQ amount as a reimbursement for the BTC they have refunded Bisq traders. .\n\n## Process, In Detail\n\nTo better understand arbitration, we need to first understand the new trade protocol, and how it improves upon the old trade protocol.\n\n## = Pre v1.2 Trade Protocol\n=\n\nThe previous model with 2-of-3 multisig deposit transactions (where an arbitrator was the 3rd key holder, and makes the payout to one of the traders in dispute cases) carried a significant risk: if the arbitrator was malicious (or was hacked), he could have taken all offers with a sockpuppet trader and made the payouts right back to his own sockpuppet.\n\nThis risk made it impossible to scale dispute resolution and find more arbitrators—we were limited to filling the role with a tiny number of Bisq contributors who could be 100% trusted to not be malicious and who had a good enough background in computer security to make getting hacked highly unlikely.\n\nThis element was the single most problematic element in Bisq’s old trade protocol, but since there weren’t any better solutions, we used it for as long as we had to.\n\n## = Post 1.2 Trade Protocol\n=\n\nThe new trade protocol, launched in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.0 Bisq v1.2], eliminates the risks described above to a large extent by separating functions and involving the DAO. It significantly improves censorship-resistance, security, and scalability of dispute resolution on Bisq.\n\nthumb|right|Dispute resolution for trade protocol (v1.2+).\n\nThe basic change is that it uses a 2-of-2 multisig in the deposit transaction with only the traders’ keys.\n\nOn the happy path, the traders each sign the payout tx once the fiat or altcoin is transferred.\n\nIf anything goes wrong, there are 3 stages to resolve the issue:\n\n# The traders can have a direct chat where they can try to find a solution to their problem.\n# If that does not succeed either trader can open a mediation ticket and request help from a mediator. Mediators play a role similar to that of arbitrators in the old model, except they don’t have a 3rd key. They only can make a ''suggestion'' for the payout distribution, which either trader is free to accept or reject. If both traders accept, they create and sign the payout tx and the trade is completed. If either trader rejects, the dispute goes to stage 3. This escalation can only take place after a certain time period has passed. For altcoins, this period is 10 days, and for fiat it’s 20 days.\n# An arbitrator will investigate the case, just like a mediator would, and decide how a payout should be distributed. The arbitrator role currently has 2 parts: supreme mediator and refund agent (this is where the term ''refund agent'' comes from, but ''arbitrator'' is a better term for the role, as we will soon see). The supreme mediator part of the role is similar in function to that of a regular mediator (i.e., investigate a dispute). The refund agent reimburses traders BTC for disputed trades without requiring them to undergo the complex and time-consuming process of making a reimbursement request in the DAO. The ultimate goal, however, is to make such extreme dispute cases so ''rare'' that requiring users to request reimbursement from the DAO on their own becomes feasible (e.g., by reducing bugs, UX improvements, increasing security deposits, etc). But we’re not there yet, so for now, an arbitrator simply decides on a payout ''and'' funds this payout from their own pocket, and later makes a reimbursement request to the DAO to be reimbursed for their reimbursement to the user. To avoid potential fraud, and to keep the DAO from losing money in each arbitration case, we use the donation address to receive the funds from the trade via the time-locked delayed payout payout tx.\n\n## = Time-Locked Delayed Payout Payout Transaction\n=\nSince [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.8 v1.9.8], traders create a time-locked delayed payout payout tx where all the locked up funds (trade amount + both security deposits) are sent to Bisq donation address owners, also known as burningmen. These addresses are defined in the DAO. The burningmen are Bisq contributors who burn their BSQ in order to get a portion of time-locked delayed payouts and trading fees paid in BTC.\nFrom v1.2 to v1.9.8, this address was controlled by a single burning man who exchanged BTC for BSQ to burn them afterwards. That supposed a risk for the DAO as, although the burningman had to place a BSQ bond, the amount of the bond was lower than the amount of expected BTC to collect. Distributing the role into multiple burningman and requiring them to burn BSQ in advance, this risk has significantly decreased.\n\nIf a trade is not completed in 10 days (for altcoins) or 20 days (for fiat), either of the 2 traders have a chance (after mediation) to publish the time-locked payout tx where all deposit funds are sent to the donation address, requiring the aggrieved trader to request arbitration so they can receive a payout. With the preliminary solution we use now, the trader gets a payout from an arbitrator directly, '''but the eventual goal is that the arbitrator makes a suggestion which the DAO uses as a basis for voting on the reimbursement request made by the trader(s)'''.\n\n## = Avoiding Fraud\n=\n\nThe time-locked delayed payout payout tx is essential to avoid fraud. A trader could make a self-trade and then claim that his “peer” has not paid. Without the time-locked payout tx, he could go through the dispute process, make a reimbursement request, and receive BSQ for the equivalent “lost” funds in BTC. After that he could make the payout to himself from the trade, since he controls both “traders”—thereby scamming the DAO with the trade amount.\n\nTo avoid this fraud, we require that locked up funds in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx are spent before opening an arbitration ticket. Thus it is not possible for a trader to defraud the DAO in the way described above.\n\n## = Donation Address Owners (burningmen)\n=\n\nBurningmen are current and past contributors who earned BSQ by contributing to Bisq who opt to to burn their BSQ to get BTC from time-locked delayed payout transactions and trading fees paid in BTC. A DAO filter distributes the BTC in proportion to their relative amount of BSQ burned. The amount of BSQ to be burned is limited for each contributor, to prevent that a single burningman could create self trades and take advantage from being refunded at arbitration and receiving BTC from the DAO filter as well. In order to keep this system safe, it is required that refund agent does not reimburse a security deposit from deposit transaction.\nThe amount of BSQ to be burned (burn target) is estimated from accumulated reimbursement requests, trade fees paid in BTC and burned BSQ from burningmen in the last 12 months.\nThe BSQ burned and BTC sent to burningmen should balance over time. Each one of the burningmen, according to their prefferences, could try to \"charge\" a discount rate for the risk assumed advancing their BSQ to the DAO by burning less than the burning target, or they could try to \"pay\" to avoid selling big volumes of BSQ to a low liquid market by overburning (up to 100.000 BSQ over the burning target). They could also under or overestimate the amount of BTC to be received over the next year, which is the period that burned amounts decay linearly: the burn target is an estimation with data from the past.\nDAO contributors have another way to turn BSQ into BTC while contributing to remove the legacy burningman, which was a central point of failure for the Bisq DAO and created distorsion as a big BSQ buyer. Some burningmen will require to buy BSQ to be burned eventually. The impact for the market will be reduced as there will be multiple interested parties.\n\nLet’s make a simple example to clarify:\n\n* Two traders are engaged in a 1 BTC trade, with 0.15 BTC each locked in a security deposit\n* 1.3 BTC is locked in the 2-of-2 multisig deposit tx (ignoring miner fees)\n* Assume BSQ/BTC is trading at 0.0001 (for easy calculations)\n\nAfter the required time passes, and the mediation process is closed, one of the traders opens an arbitration case. By doing so, the 1.3 BTC is sent to donation addresses (controlled by the burning men). This transaction was signed by both traders at the time the offer was taken, but was time-locked so it was invalid until the required time had passed. The arbitrator investigates the case and makes a 1.15 BTC payout to the winning trader. He pays this sum from his personal wallet (pre-financing).\n\nWe assume that burningmen know there will be only one delayed payout during a cycle: burningmen burned 12,000 BSQ and received the 1.3 BTC into different addresses (which generates a 0.1 BTC profit), each one receiving a % based on the amount they've burned.\nThe arbitrator then makes a reimbursement request of 11,500 BSQ to settle his pre-financing. When approved, the DAO issues 11,500 BSQ to the arbitrator. The 0.1 BTC profit for burningmen was subsidized with the 0.15 BTC from the unpaid security deposit. The DAO keeps the other 0.5 BTC in form of reduction in BSQ supply of 0.05 BTC.\nArbitrator will have to burn or sell the BSQ the reimbursed BSQ to get BTC for new payments and reduce volatility risk, which is taking a high risk as they pre-finance the reimbursement. Bisq tries to make arbitration rare as reimbursing traders has a big cost.\n\n## = Why We Cannot Merge the Arbitrator and Burning Man Roles\n=\n\nThe separation of these roles is essential to keep the system flexible, censorship-resistant, and scalable.\n\n'''Keep in mind that the current dual role of arbitrators (i.e., supreme mediator and refund agent) is not the ultimate goal'''. The refund agent part of the role should be delegated to traders once the trade process is improved to a level where such cases rarely happen. How to keep the burden for traders low, and how to compensate them for this extra work—these items are still up for discussion (e.g. the trader could get a slight bonus if he does the reimbursement himself). A preferred option is to keep trader-submitted reimbursement requests optional and still offer arbitrator-funded reimbursements for a fee. The role could even be split, such that a market of refund agents develops where each agent offers their pre-financing services at different prices. But before getting into any of these discussions, we need to reduce bugs and improve UX.\n\nThe role of the burning man has been distributed between different contributors and a part of their earnings come directly as BTC, but it could also disappear when we have very few dispute cases, and once trade fees in BTC do not add up to a large amount. We could use the donation address to support critical infrastructure we use like Tor. Or we could use it to fund Bisq projects like the mobile wallet. There are many possibilities for how we could use these funds—but if we merged the burning man role with the arbitrator role, we would lose this flexibility.\n\nThe risks of the 2 roles are very different. An arbitrator does not present any severe risk to the DAO, actually, he ''takes on'' a lot of risk. A single burning man, on the other hand, is a trusted role and there is an open problem that a malicious burning man could make many trades, go to the arbitrator, get payouts, and then run away with the funds he received from the donation address. The high bond is a partial protection, but ultimately, this is a trusted role and only highly trusted Bisq contributors can take it on. This problem has been mitigated by distributing the role between different contributors with a cap on how much BTC they can get. So scalability is a small issue with the distributed burningmen, but we cannot say the same about the arbitrator. With more traders, there will be more cases, and we might need more arbitrators. Furthermore, with more regional expansion, we will need arbitrators with particular language skills. When arbitrators and burningmen are not combined into one role, we can add arbitrators to support this growth without posing high risk to the Bisq network. If we merged both roles, we would not be able to do this. There is a risk arbitrators expose to the DAO: they could fake their reporting, but this is likely solvable (traders can provide evidence).\n\nAnother important aspect is that arbitrator reimbursement is not automated. DAO stakeholders have ultimate power. Sure, they would probably lose an arbitrator if they don’t reimburse him fairly, and it might be hard to find new arbitrators after unfair behaviour from DAO stakeholders. But it is highly important that stakeholders be able to exercise absolute power.\n\nAnother consideration: if the process to reimburse arbitrators were automated, the result would probably involve legal risks that we want to avoid. The role would then adopt elements of a custodial function, and that would likely trigger regulatory issues.\n\n## = FAQ\n=\n\n'''What are the conditions that lead to a payout, for example, a dispute between Bob and Alice that is not resolved by normal mediation and gets escalated to arbitration?'''\n\nAfter the time-lock period (10 days for altcoins and 20 days for fiat), and after mediation is completed, either trader can open an arbitration ticket. Doing so publishes the time-locked delayed payout transaction.\n\n'''How are Bob and Alice's BTC funds paid out to the Bisq donation addresses?'''\n\nThe time-locked payout transaction is created and signed in the take-offer process and stored by both traders. The trade protocol requires this transaction to be in place before a trade is started.\n\n'''How is the arbitrator responsible for deciding what the payout distribution should be? Are facts and circumstances of the case taken into account? And how is this similar to legacy arbitration?'''\n\nIn terms of determining what a payout should be, an arbitrator's role is the same as that of a mediator. They'll ask you for any additional information they need to determine the facts and circumstances of the case. The only practical difference between arbitration and legacy arbitration is that arbitrators use their own funds to pay trader(s) instead of funds from the trading escrow.\n\n'''How, upon deciding a payout, does an arbitrator pay the BTC to Bob and Alice?'''\n\nArbitrators need to have enough BTC to cover potential payouts (up to 0.5 BTC per trade) — it's a requirement for anyone seeking to hold the role. An arbitration case can only be closed once an arbitrator makes a payout. Then, at the end of the DAO cycle, they'll get reimbursed with BSQ (which they can then sell for BTC).\n\n'''Are there any trades the arbitrator will not pay out? '''\n\nArbitrators will only reimburse trades in which the multisig deposit has been sent to the Bisq donation addresses. For trades requiring large reimbursements (above 0.5 BTC) they should be aware the arbitrators will only [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/296 partially reimburse traders up to 0.5 BTC]. Should a trader require a reimbursement over 0.5 BTC they can make a reimbursement request directly to the DAO on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support support repository].\n\n'''How does the arbitrator issue a reimbursement request for an amount of BSQ equivalent to the amount of BTC paid out-of-pocket to settle disputes?'''\n\nThis process is a work in progress. Currently we try to reduce volatility and exposure risk by converting pre-financed BTC to BSQ as fast as possible. Once it is BSQ there is no longer any volatility risk, and the arbitrator simply sums up all pre-financed BSQ and requests reimbursement. The public result of an arbitrator's work is a reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO.\n\n'''How does the DAO issue this BSQ to reimburse arbitrators?'''\n\nA reimbursement request is technically the same as a compensation request. DAO stakeholders vote on an arbitrator's request. The arbitrator needs to provide solid reporting to make their request transparent to the DAO. Currently there is some trust involved, since it cannot be proven that the arbitrator is not adding fake cases. This may be solvable by collecting data from traders, but this requires more thought.\n\n'''Doesn't this dispute resolution mechanism incentivize Bisq to have more trades go to arbitration, since disputed BTC funds are sent to the burningmen, and thereby benefit BSQ holders and themselves?'''\n\nIt's the traders who open arbitration, the DAO can't start arbitration, although it could generate bugs and be unresponsive at mediation. In this case, traders will be fully reimbursed (which will generate a loss for the DAO, as arbitrator charges for every arbitration case) if they have done enough reporting the issue and trying to get support through Matrix or Github.\nBugs and requiring arbitration is a bad user experience, so the DAO is also incentivized to keep arbitration and mediation cases at the minimum.\n\n'''How does an arbitrator spends their newly-issued BSQ?\n\nThe arbitrator sells BSQ for BTC from the market and burns BSQ as soon as reimbursement request is paid.\n\n'''How does the burningman burn the BSQ they earn or buy?'''\n\nBurning is done inside the Bisq software on <code>DAO / Burning / Burningmen</code>.\n\n'''Why not simply combine the burning man and arbitrator roles?'''\n\nSee longer explanation above. In short: to stay flexible, to be able to implement the target vision (reimbursement done by traders themselves), to avoid legal risks, to keep the arbitrator role scalable, and to address the trust/security issue with the current burning man model.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "bisq2"}

No special payment accounts need to be created. The offer maker creates the offer (BSQ is default trade currency).\n\n600px|thumb|left|Creating a BSQ swap offer.\n\nAs long as the offer maker has enough of what they want to trade in their wallet (either BTC or BSQ), the offer will be live and visible on the network. If the relevant wallet balance ever goes below the amount required to complete the swap, the swap offer automatically deactivates.\n* if a user creates a swap offer to sell 1000 BSQ, the offer will remain live as long as their BSQ wallet has more than 1000 BSQ\n* if a user creates a swap offer to buy 0.5 BTC, the offer will remain live as long as their Bisq BTC wallet has more than 0.5 BTC\n\nOffers can still be activated or deactivated manually in <code>Portfolio</code> > <code>My Open Offers</code> as usual.\n\nTaken offers show in a new <code>BSQ Swap Trades</code> tab on the <code>Portfolio</code> screen.\n\nOf course, this trade protocol can only work while both users are online, but Bisq offers can only be taken when both maker and taker are online anyway, and these trades can be settled almost instantly so there is no further expectation that users be online for any particular amount of time (e.g. for 1 hour with instant altcoins offers).\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSince the protocol is trustless, BSQ swaps do not require Bisq's conventional dispute resolution.\n\nRarely, an invalid transaction could be committed to your wallet. In such a case, you will need to resync your SPV file to get rid of it.\n\n## Background\n\n## = Transaction structure\n=\n\nHere we cover the basic mechanics of BSQ swaps.\n\nBTC buyers and sellers need to pay BTC mining fees and BSQ trading fees, but the BSQ swap protocol simplifies the transaction by only having BTC inputs for BTC sellers and BSQ inputs for BSQ sellers. The appropriate deductions are made from the outputs (e.g. the BTC buyer/BSQ seller gets BTC with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted; similarly, the BTC seller/BSQ buyer gets BSQ with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted).\n\nNow let us examine an example trade to see the structure of such a transaction.\n\nThis is how a transaction for a 1 BTC/50,000 BSQ swap with a 0.5 BSQ maker fee and 1.5 BSQ taker fee would look. We estimate the buyer's share of the mining fee to be 2000 sats and the seller's share of the mining fee to be 2500 sats.\n\nAssuming Alice makes an offer to buy BTC (sell BSQ) and Bob takes her offer (making him BTC seller/BSQ buyer):\n\n* Alice's BSQ input(s): min. 50,000 BSQ + 0.5 BSQ trade fee\n* Bob's BTC input(s): min. 1 BTC + 2500 sat - 150 sat (his BSQ trade fee will be used for mining fee, so he needs a bit less of a mining fee)\n* Bob's BSQ payout output: 50,000 BSQ - 1.5 BSQ trade fee\n* Alice's BSQ change output: xxx BSQ - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact\n* Alice's BTC payout output: 1 BTC - 2000 sat miner fee + 50 sat from BSQ fee\n* Bob's BTC change output: yyy BTC - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact\n\n## = Spam prevention\n=\n\nWith the conventional Bisq trade protocol, the maker fee transaction acts as a spam prevention measure: you cannot create an offer without spending bitcoin.\n\nThe BSQ swap protocol has no such transaction, so instead, a proof-of-work (POW) mechanism is used. The difficulty level (number of leading zeros) is set in the filter. When creating an offer, the maker does the required POW and attaches the resulting data to their offer. Each node verifies the POW and only shows offers with valid POW.\n\nIf POW difficulty is increased, offer makers must re-do their POW in the background and republish their offers. Old offers are removed from the network and new offers with new POW are added.\n\nEach offer has a counter appended to its offer ID (after the version number, in the full offer ID) each time a new POW is completed. This enables each re-published offer with new POW to have a new offer ID that looks the same to users (since the short offer ID doesn't change).\n\nAt first, POW difficulty will be set to a very low value so users do not notice anything (low milliseconds on modern laptop hardware), but will be increased as needed.", "category": "bisq2"}

{"title": "Frequently asked questions", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBelow is a compilation of '''frequently-asked questions (FAQ)''' about Bisq, how to use it, and how to help the project.\n\nFeel free to ask further questions on any of Bisq's many outreach channels linked at the bottom of this page.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## About\n\n##\nHow is Bisq different from other decentralized exchanges?\n##\n\nBisq is fundamentally different: it's a peer-to-peer trading network accessed via software you run on your own hardware, not a website or centralized service. It connects you directly to other users running the software to facilitate trades. It's open-source and community-driven via a DAO.\n\nCrucially, you can trade bitcoin directly for fiat currencies (like USD, EUR) or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThink of it like owning your home versus renting. With Bisq, you have full control over your funds and data; with centralized services (even DEX websites), you're subject to the platform's rules and risks.\n\nWith Bisq you're always the owner:\n\n* Bisq does '''not''' hold your bitcoin. Trading funds (in the classic v1 protocol) are held in '''2-of-2 multisignature addresses''' controlled solely by you and your trading peer.\n* Bisq does '''not''' hold your national currency. Fiat transfers happen directly between traders using external payment services.\n* All data travels over Bisq's secure peer-to-peer network built on Tor—no central servers means '''no data honeypots''' vulnerable to large-scale hacks.\n* Bisq requires '''no registration or KYC''', protecting your privacy. Data about who trades with whom is not stored.\n* Bisq is code, not a company, governed by its DAO.\n\nSee more in the Introduction.\n\n##\nIs Bisq open-source software?\n##\n\nYes. Bisq's software is free/libre open-source licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3).\n\nYou can find the [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq source code] and [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/LICENSE license] on GitHub.\n\n##\nIs Bisq safe?\n##\n\nBisq is designed with multiple layers of security, and strong incentives encourage fair trading, making the vast majority of trades proceed smoothly.\n\nKey security mechanisms (particularly in the classic v1 protocol) include:\n\n* Bitcoin secured in a 2-of-2 multisignature escrow address controlled only by the traders.\n* Mandatory security deposits from both traders, refunded upon successful completion, deterring fraud.\n* A 3-tier dispute resolution system (trader chat, mediation, arbitration) for handling issues.\n\nHowever, trading fiat currencies always carries some inherent '''chargeback risk''', as banks can sometimes reverse payments. Bisq mitigates this by:\n\n* Supporting mainly payment methods known to have lower chargeback risk (explicitly avoiding easily reversed methods like PayPal or credit cards).\n* Employing an account signing mechanism in v1 for certain fiat methods, which limits trade sizes for new accounts until integrity is established through successful trades.\n\nNewer protocols like Bisq Easy use different security models, such as relying on seller reputation instead of security deposits.\n\n## Getting started\n\n##\nI find Bisq very confusing initially!\n##\n\nYou're not alone; some users find the interface takes getting used to, especially compared to simpler centralized exchanges.\n\n* Check out the official [https://bisq.network/getting-started/ getting-started guide].\n* Visual guides and tutorials may be available on the [https://bisq.network/ Bisk Network website] or community channels. (Note: Previous specific video links were outdated/broken).\n\nBisq is under continuous development, with ongoing efforts to improve the user interface and experience.\n\n##\nMy currency market has few or no offers. What can I do?\n##\n\nMarket liquidity varies. Some markets are very active, while others are less so, often due to the availability of suitable local payment methods or lack of initial bootstrapping.\n\nYou can check recent activity for your market via `Market` > `Trades` in the application.\n\nTo help grow a market:\n* Ensure suitable local Payment methods are supported. You can [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new/choose suggest new ones here].\n* Spread the word in relevant local communities to attract both buyers/sellers and market makers. Bisq contributors can often offer support and resources for local outreach efforts.\n\n##\nDo I really need bitcoin to buy bitcoin on Bisq? How do I get started with none?\n##\n\nYes, the classic Bisq v1 trading protocol requires a small amount of BTC for security deposits and mining fees, creating a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem for complete beginners.\n\nHere are ways to get your first small amount of BTC:\n* See suggestions on the Funding your wallet page (e.g., friends, Bitcoin ATMs, earning BTC).\n* Visit the `Get your first BTC` room on [https://bisq.chat Matrix] to potentially arrange small, informal trades (details here).\n* Use the '''Bisq Easy''' trading protocol available in Bisq 2, which does '''not''' require a security deposit, making it ideal for first-time buyers.\n\n## Trading (Classic v1 Protocol)\n\n##\nWhat are trading fees?\n##\n\nTrading fees are a percentage of the trade size. If paid in BTC, makers pay 0.1% and takers pay 0.7%. Fees are roughly halved if paid in BSQ tokens. Remember you also need BTC for on-chain mining fees (for deposit and payout transactions) and the security deposit itself (which is returned if the trade completes successfully).\n\n##\nMining fees are high. How can I trade cost-effectively?\n##\n\nThe classic protocol requires 4 on-chain transactions (3 paid by taker, 1 by maker). To minimize costs:\n* Be an offer '''maker''' rather than a taker (fewer transactions to pay for).\n* Trade when network '''mining fees are lower'''.\n* Make offers for '''larger BTC amounts''' (fees are fixed per transaction, less impactful on larger trades).\n* '''Pay trading fees with BSQ''' for an approximate 50% discount.\n\n##\nWhy require a security deposit in BTC?\n##\n\nSecurity deposits incentivize both parties to follow the Trading rules. They are locked in multisig escrow with the trade amount and returned upon successful completion. If rules are broken, the deposit can be partially or fully awarded to the counterparty via dispute resolution, deterring violations like non-payment or failing to confirm payment.\n\n##\nWhat are trading limits? How much can I trade at once?\n##\n\nMaximum BTC per trade varies by payment method based on perceived risk (especially chargeback risk). For example, methods like Zelle or SEPA often have lower limits (e.g., 0.0625 BTC) than less reversible methods. Altcoin trades generally have higher limits (e.g., 0.5 BTC in v1) as chargebacks aren't possible. Check the Payment methods page for current limits per method. Also see Account_limits regarding initial limits for new accounts.\n\n##\nWhich payment methods are available?\n##\n\nSee the Payment methods page for the full list. You can [https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/new/choose suggest new payment methods] via GitHub.\n\n##\nHow does Bisq handle fiat (USD, EUR, etc.)?\n##\n\nBisq '''never''' touches or holds fiat currency. Fiat payments are transferred directly between the buyer and seller using their agreed-upon external payment service (e.g., bank transfer, Zelle). Bisq's role is to provide the secure environment (escrow, deposits) and process for peers to coordinate this external transfer safely.\n\n##\nHow long does a trade take?\n##\n\nTrade times vary greatly depending on the chosen payment method and trader responsiveness.\n* Bisq requires the initial deposit transaction to confirm (usually ~10 minutes) before the buyer can send payment.\n* Some Payment methods are near-instant (SEPA Instant, Faster Payments), allowing trades to complete quickly after the deposit confirms.\n* Others take days (SEPA, Wire Transfers, ACH).\n* Altcoin trades are typically faster (1 day or 1 hour for Instant).\nCheck the Payment methods page for the maximum trading period allowed for each method. Manual confirmation by both parties is always required.\n\n##\nHow does Bisq protect my privacy?\n##\n\n* Bisq is standalone software, not a website logging your activity.\n* Payment information is stored locally and only shared with your direct trading peer (and potentially dispute resolution agents if needed).\n* All P2P network communication uses Tor for IP address anonymization.\n* All data exchanged between users is end-to-end encrypted.\n* No registration or KYC is required.\n\n##\nDo I need to keep Bisq online for my offers?\n##\n\nYes. Since there are no central servers, your Bisq application must be running and online for your offers to be visible and available for others to take. If Bisq goes offline, your offers are removed from the distributed offer book but are automatically republished the next time you start Bisq. Once a trade *starts*, continuous connection isn't required, but you must come online periodically to perform necessary actions (send payment, confirm receipt).\n\n##\nDo I have to use the built-in Bisq wallet?\n##\n\nNo. While convenient for holding trading funds (BTC, BSQ) and security deposits, you can choose to send funds *from* or receive funds *to* an external wallet address when initiating or completing trades.\n\n##\nDo I have to use the BSQ token?\n##\n\nNo, using BSQ is optional. You can pay Trading fees in BTC. However, using BSQ provides a significant discount (around 50%) on trading fees and directly supports Bisq contributors through the DAO mechanism.\n\n##\nWill my bank know I'm trading bitcoin?\n##\n\nBisq itself doesn't interact with your bank. However, your trading peer will see your name associated with the payment. Some banks have been known to flag accounts involved in peer-to-peer crypto trading. To minimize potential issues:\n* '''Never''' put Bitcoin-related terms (\"BTC\", \"Bisq\", etc.) in payment references/memos.\n* Leave the reference field '''blank''' if possible.\n* If a reference is required, use something neutral and innocuous, or just your name. Agree with your peer via trader chat if unsure.\nSee Trading rules for details.\n\n## Common Technical Niggles\n\n## = Startup / Connection Issues\n=\n\n##\nBisq on macOS won't open, or asks for keystroke recording permission!\n##\n\n* If it won't open, try right-clicking the app icon and selecting `Open`.\n* The keystroke permission prompt is a known issue related to older Java versions sometimes bundled; Bisq does '''not''' record keystrokes. See [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373 GitHub issue 3373] for historical context. Ensure you are using a recent Bisq version.\n\n##\nBisq seems slow or uses high CPU/memory on startup.\n##\n\nThis is often caused by Bisq synchronizing blockchain data (SPV sync). While newer releases include recent data to speed this up, it can still take time, especially if you haven't run Bisq recently. Let it finish syncing; performance should normalize afterwards. If issues persist on a current version, check Reducing_memory_usage or seek support.\n\n##\nOn Linux with a high-resolution display, everything is tiny!\n##\n\nSee Running_on_HiDPI_screen for solutions.\n\n##\n\"Payment started\" button won't stick / asks to send confirmation again.\n##\n\nThis is a known issue related to P2P network conditions, often when the peer is offline. Try these steps:\n* Send a message in trader chat.\n* Click the \"Payment started\" button multiple times.\n* Restart Bisq.\n* Try `Settings` > `Network Info` > `Open Tor Settings` > `Delete Outdated Tor Files And Shutdown`, then restart Bisq.\n* Wait while staying online (it sometimes resolves itself).\n* If the trade period is ending, open mediation (`Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O` on the trade) and explain the issue to the Mediator, potentially providing screenshots.\n\n## = Wallet / Sync Issues\n=\n\n##\n\"Offer cannot be taken due to counterparty trade restrictions\". What does this mean?\n##\n\nThis usually means information about the offer maker's account limits (based on age/signing status) hasn't fully propagated across the P2P network to your Bisq instance yet. Try restarting Bisq. The offer maker might also need to restart their Bisq client.\n\n##\nMy SPV resync is taking forever or freezing!\n##\n\nThis can happen with older wallets or wallets with many transactions.\n* If it stalls, close and restart Bisq to resume the sync.\n* Syncing is much faster if you connect Bisq to your own local Bitcoin full node.\n* After a very long resync completes, consider switching to a fresh wallet to prevent future issues.\n\n##\nHow can I get a fresh Bisq wallet and transfer my BSQ balance to it?\n##\n\nThis involves carefully renaming directories while Bisq is '''closed'''. The wallet is in `btc_mainnet/wallet` inside your Data_directory.\n1. Ensure you have some BTC in your current wallet for transaction fees.\n2. Close Bisq. Rename the `wallet` directory to `oldWallet`.\n3. Start Bisq. It will create a new, empty `wallet` directory. Immediately go to `Account` > `Wallet Seed`, write down the new seed phrase securely offline, and note down your new BTC and BSQ receiving addresses.\n4. Close Bisq. Rename the new `wallet` directory to `newWallet`. Rename `oldWallet` back to `wallet`.\n5. Start Bisq (loading your original wallet). Send your BSQ and BTC funds to the new receiving addresses you saved in step 3.\n6. Close Bisq. Rename `wallet` to `oldWallet` (or delete it if funds are confirmed sent and old seed backed up). Rename `newWallet` to `wallet`.\n7. Start Bisq. You should see your funds in the fresh wallet.\n\n## = DAO Sync Issues\n=\n\n##\n\"heightOfLastBlock must match chainHeight\" error on startup\n##\n\nThis indicates a DAO state mismatch. Try this fix:\n1. Make a backup of your data directory.\n2. Close Bisq.\n3. Navigate to your Data_directory. Delete the `DaoStateStore` directory and the `BsqBlocks` directory (usually found within `btc_mainnet/db/`).\n4. Restart Bisq. It will resync the DAO state.\n\n##\n\"Cannot take offer because snapshot height does not match...\" error\n##\n\nThis means your local DAO state is out of sync with your peer.\n1. Try going to `Settings` > `Preferences` and click \"Rebuild DAO state from resources\".\n2. Restart Bisq when prompted. Let the DAO sync fully (watch for \"Synchronizing DAO\" message at the bottom to disappear).\n3. Try taking the offer again. If the error persists, the other trader likely needs to resync their DAO state.\n\n## = Installation / Environment Issues\n=\n\n##\nI want to install Bisq on a VPS or headless system.\n##\n\nBisq requires a graphical desktop environment. Some users report success using tools like [https://www.xpra.org Xpra] to forward the GUI, but this is an advanced setup and not officially supported.\n\n##\nI receive a `Java heap space` error on Linux.\n##\n\nYou may need to increase the memory allocated to Bisq. Edit the launch configuration file (often `/opt/bisq/lib/app/Bisq.cfg` or similar) and increase the value in `java-options=-XX:MaxRAM=Xg` (e.g., change `8g` to `16g` if you have sufficient RAM).\n\n## Dispute resolution\n\n##\nHow does dispute resolution work?\n##\n\nBisq uses a 3-layer system: Trader chat, Mediation, and Arbitration. Most issues can be resolved directly via chat. If not, a Mediator can be called (Ctrl+O / Cmd+O on the trade) to propose a resolution based on Trading rules. Arbitration is a rare final step if mediation fails. (Note: The arbitrator role changed significantly in v1.2). See Dispute_Resolution_in_Bisq_1 for full details.\n\n##\nHow is collusion between mediators, arbitrators, and traders prevented?\n##\n\nSince Bisq v1.2, trade funds are held in 2-of-2 multisig addresses controlled *only* by the two traders. Mediators and arbitrators do *not* hold a key and cannot unilaterally release funds, preventing collusion risk involving escrow control. They are still bonded roles within the DAO to ensure they act fairly and responsibly when investigating and proposing resolutions.\n\n##\nWhat happens if the buyer does a chargeback after BTC is released?\n##\n\nBisq cannot reverse fiat chargebacks made through external banking systems. If a chargeback occurs after the trade is complete and BTC is released, the seller generally has no recourse *within Bisq*. This risk is why Bisq avoids easily reversible payment methods and uses account aging and account signing (in v1) to vet traders using riskier methods. Payment methods frequently used for chargebacks may be removed from Bisq.\n\n##\nWouldn't a pure reputation system be better than dispute resolution?\n##\n\nPure reputation systems are vulnerable to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack Sybil attacks] (creating fake identities) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick long con] attacks. They can also compromise privacy (tying reputation to identity) and decentralization (requiring central storage). Bisq's model combines protocol incentives (like security deposits in v1 or Reputation in Bisq Easy) with human-based dispute resolution for robustness.\n\n##\nHow can I contact my trading peer?\n##\n\nUse the built-in, end-to-end encrypted trader chat available within the trade screen in the Bisq application. Avoid external communication methods.\n\n## DAO\n\n##\nWhat is the Bisq DAO?\n##\n\nThe Bisq DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is how the Bisq project governs itself and funds its development without relying on a traditional company structure. It's built on Bitcoin and ensures the project remains decentralized and censorship-resistant, aligning governance with the software's principles. Read the Introduction_to_the_DAO.\n\n##\nHow does the Bisq DAO work?\n##\n\nIt primarily handles funding and strategy:\n1. '''Funding:''' Trading fees paid by users (especially when paid in BSQ, Bisq's native token) are distributed to contributors whose work is approved by DAO voting.\n2. '''Strategy:''' Project direction, parameter changes, and other decisions are made collectively through proposals and voting by BSQ stakeholders within the Bisq application.\nLearn more in the DAO documentation. (Note: Previous specific video links were outdated/broken).\n\n##\nWhat do I need to know about the DAO as a trader?\n##\n\nParticipation is '''optional'''. You don't need BSQ or DAO interaction to trade. However, using BSQ to pay Trading fees gives you a significant discount (~50%) and directly funds project contributors. When you buy BSQ, you typically buy it from a contributor; when you pay fees with BSQ, it's 'burned' (destroyed). See more on this cycle here.\n\n##\nIs BSQ just for fundraising? What's its issuance?\n##\n\nNo, the DAO/BSQ system is primarily for decentralized '''distribution''' of existing trading fee revenue to contributors, not for initial fundraising. BSQ is 'issued' (created by coloring bitcoin) only when a contributor's compensation request is approved by DAO vote. It's 'destroyed' when used for fees. There's no pre-mine or fixed issuance schedule like many other tokens.\n\n##\nCan I use Bisq without BSQ and the DAO?\n##\n\nYou can pay Trading fees with BTC instead of BSQ. However, since Bisq version 1.9.8, the DAO components are always active in the background as they are integral to how contributor roles and network parameters are managed. Using the DAO/BSQ provides benefits (lower fees) and supports the project's decentralized funding model, which avoids reliance on centralized wallets. Learn more about the DAO here.

{"title": "Burning Men", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\n'''Burning Men''' is the name given to Bisq contributors who choose to burn BSQ in order to receive bitcoin from Bisq trading activity: Trade fees and Delayed payout transactions. It's an evolution of the previous 'burning man' role. The change, implemented since January 2023 in this [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390 proposal], aimed to increase Bisq's decentralization by distributing this role within many contributors. A single burning man could have gone missing, ran away with the BTC before trading them for BSQ and burning these BSQ, or could have been otherwise compromised.<br>\nAs each burning men burns an undetermined amount of BSQ as a condition to receive a share of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, trust requirements and single points of failure are almost nonexistent.\nPlease note: The burningmen protocol described here is entirely different from burns made in Bisq 2 for increasing reputation. Burns made in Bisq 2 do not affect the burningmen protocol.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Contributing as a Burningmen =\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThere are two ways to contribute as a Burningmen. Since the system is not exempt of trust requirements, burningmen need to have provided value to Bisq in the past:\n\n* Contributors who received compensation for their contributions within the last 24 cycles.\n* Contributors who received a BSQ from the DAO genesis transaction.\n\nAfter burning some BSQ (it does not matter if they were previously earned or bought in the BSQ market) they will get a share percentage in the distribution of BTC from Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions. The more value they've provided to Bisq, the bigger the portion of BSQ they are allowed to burn.\n\n## Considerations before burning BSQ\n\nBurningmen seek profit from burning BSQ, otherwise they would keep their BSQ or sell them for BTC at the market. But profit, coming from estimating the amount of BSQ to burn now to receive a share of future Trading fees and Delayed payout transactions, is not granted. There are many sources of uncertainty:\n* Trading volume: affected by BTC trend, Bisq competitors, mining fees, etc.\n* Changes to trade protocol: traders could burn more or less BSQ directly, Delayed payout transactions could be reduced considerably.\n* BSQ/BTC price volatility.\n* BSQ burnt by competing Burningmen.\n\nSince the launch of the Burningmen protocol up to the moment of this writing (Cycle 61), more bitcoin has been distributed to the Burningmen than the bitcoin equivalent amount of BSQ that has been burnt. This means that, historically, burning BSQ has been profitable for most contributors. <br>\nAlthough Bisq provides an estimation of BSQ to burn based in the past, each of the Burningmen should estimate their risk/reward scenarios based in their predictions. Becoming a Burningmen is optional. Depending on how they value the BSQ they have now, the BTC they can obtain on the future, or even if they just want to help Bisq grow, they will not burn BSQ at all, burn all the BSQ from their compensation requests or even buy more BSQ to burn up to their limit. <br>\nThe less competition between Burningmen there is, the more profitable it will be for each of them, and vice versa. The less profitable Burningmen role is, the better for the DAO, as more BSQ is burnt, reducing or containing BSQ supply and therefore pressuring its price up.\n\n= Burning BSQ and receiving BTC =\n\n## Contributors\n\nWhen doing their compensation request, a contributor should fill the \"Burningman receiving address\" with a BTC address to receive the funds to. Once the compensation request is approved, that address will be used for any burning men payouts they receive up until they ever change it in a subsequent approved compensation request. If that field is never completed, an address from Bisq wallet will be used as receiving address. <br>\nIt is highly recommended to use an external wallet like electrum or sparrow, which are able to handle many UTXOs and can connect to a signing device for cold storage.\n\nTo burn BSQ for the BSQ burning man role the current contributor will see their assigned name 'contributor_name' in the Burningmen Protocol UI. They can then choose to burn an amount of BSQ and press burn. <br>\nSince ''Issuance share'' is capped depending on how many BTC were earned in the last 2 years (decaying linearly) it's important to make sure that the amount of BTC to burn will not exceed the cap. It would be prudent to begin with small amounts and never exceed the lower amount in the ''burn target'' column.\n\n## Receivers of the genesis distribution\n\nIf a contributor has funds from the genesis output(s) in their Bisq wallet they will see their assigned name 'Bisq co founder XX' in the Burningmen Protocol UI. They should chose the BTC address to receive funds and follow the instructions in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/390#issuecomment-1306075295 github proposal].\n\nBurning BSQ works as described in the second paragraph at contributors section.\n\n= Burning Men Protocol UI =\n\nThe user interface to interact with the Burning Men User protocol user interface can be found at <code>DAO > Proof of Burn > Burning Men</code>.\n\n## Burning Men Candidates fields\n\n* Contributor name: Always use the same name as per github handle when doing compensation requests to avoid duplicated similar contributors with different names and shares.\n* Burn target: Click the <code>?</code> icon to get more info. Take these numbers as broad estimates and do not use the one on the right as your cap will be exceeded. Even using the left value could make you reach your cap. Do not make decisions based on what to burn on these numbers alone.\n* Receiver share: It informs about the % chance of receiving a trade fee and % amount of the delayed payout transactions you'll receive. It's updated every block and changes based on who burns BSQ '''and''' the decay over time of the burns made by the burningmen. Each BSQ burnt amount decays linearly to zero over 12 months. To protect the DAO from an attack from a malicious contributor who self trades sending their trades to arbitration, the maximum share each contributor can get is 11%, no matter how many BSQ they burn.\n* Issuance share: It's the amount of BSQ compensation each contributor has received over the last 24 cycles, decaying linearly. Recent contributions have a higher weight. It bears maximum receiver share. A burning man can get a receiver share of up to 10 times their issuance share amount, up to a maximum of 11%. A 0.7% percent issuance share will limit the receiver share to 7%.\n* Burned amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by contributor over time\n* Decayed burn amount: Total amount of BSQ burned by the contributor when taking into account the decay their burns have over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the 'receiver share' value and changes every block.\n* Issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor over time.\n* Decayed issued amount: Total amount of BSQ issued to a contributor when taking into account the decay over time. It is essentially represented in percentage terms by the 'issuance share' value.\n\n## Profit fields\n\nWhen selecting a burningmen, individual profit stats are displayed. It can be filtered by burning, trading fee and/or DPT eventsand by month or individual events. Looking at monthly profits can be used as an indicator of how many BSQ to burn. Note that it's normal to have a negative profit at the beginning, since receiver shares decay linearly over 12 cycles. A burning man should not expect to regain in one month what will be distributed during a longer period. <br>\nScrolling down at the _Profit_ table, it's possible to export all burningman data from a contributor by clicking <code>export to CSV</code>.\n\n## DAO fields\n\nIt gives an overview of BSQ burning and bitcoin distribution across all DAO contributors.\n\n* Total amount of burned BSQ: All time amount of BSQ that has been burnt by all contributors acting as burning men.\n* Total amount of distributed BTC/BSQ: All time amount of bitcoin that has been distributed to all contributors acting as burning men. For ease of comparison this figure is also given as a BSQ amount.\n* Export to CSV: To see the results by month rather than all time in a CSV file, getting a more granular data.\n\nIf the amount of BSQ being distributed is greater than the amount being burnt then the burning men are generally in profit from their activities. If the amount of BSQ being distributed is less than the amount being burnt then the burning men are in a loss from their activities.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "How to do arbitrage on Bisq", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\n'''Arbitrage''' is the practice of simultaneously buying and selling an asset in different markets (or in different forms within the same market) to profit from a temporary price difference. In inefficient or less liquid markets, like many peer-to-peer environments, arbitrage opportunities can arise more frequently.\n\nArbitrageurs play a necessary role by taking advantage of these inefficiencies. In doing so, they not only profit but also help improve market liquidity and price discovery, making the market more efficient for everyone. Bisq currently provides many arbitrage opportunities.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Types of Arbitrage on Bisq\n\nYou can perform two main types of arbitrage involving Bisq:\n\n## = Inter-Exchange Arbitrage\n=\n\nThis involves finding price differences between Bisq and another exchange or market (Market X).\n\n'''Example:'''\n# You observe that the lowest price to '''SELL''' Bitcoin on Bisq's EUR/BTC market is currently '''€85,500'''.\n# Simultaneously, you find you can '''BUY''' Bitcoin on Market X (e.g., a centralized exchange) for '''€85,100'''.\n# You execute both trades at roughly the same time: '''Buy''' 1 BTC on Market X for €85,100 and '''Sell''' 1 BTC on Bisq for €85,500.\n# Assuming successful execution, this yields a potential profit of '''€400''' per BTC, '''before''' accounting for any fees (trading, withdrawal, mining, payment method).\n\n(The reverse is also possible: buying cheaper on Bisq and selling higher elsewhere).\n\n## = Intra-Exchange Arbitrage\n=\n\nThis involves exploiting price differences *within* the Bisq platform itself. This can happen between different currency markets or different payment methods within the same currency market.\n\n##\nCross-Currency Arbitrage\n##\n\nIf the implied cross-rate between two fiat currencies (e.g., USD and EUR) differs from the prevailing market rate, an opportunity might exist.\n\n'''Example:'''\n# You notice the relative price in Bisq's USD/BTC market (e.g., equivalent to €86,000) is higher than in Bisq's EUR/BTC market (e.g., €85,000).\n# You simultaneously '''SELL''' BTC for USD (at the higher relative price) and '''BUY''' BTC for EUR (at the lower relative price) on Bisq.\n# If done correctly with sufficient volume, you can lock in a profit based on the temporary price discrepancy between the two Bisq markets (factoring in fees and the actual EUR/USD exchange rate).\n# Repeat as long as the profitable spread exists.\n\n##\nPayment Method Arbitrage\n##\n\nDifferent payment methods within the same currency market (e.g., EUR) might have different prices due to varying user preferences, risks, or settlement times associated with those methods.\n\n'''Example:'''\n# You see offers available to '''BUY''' Bitcoin using SEPA priced relatively low (e.g., at €85,200).\n# At the same time, you see offers available to '''SELL''' Bitcoin receiving payment via Revolut priced higher (e.g., at €85,800).\n# You simultaneously execute both: '''BUY''' 1 BTC using SEPA for €85,200 and '''SELL''' 1 BTC receiving Revolut for €85,800.\n# This yields a potential profit of '''€600''' per BTC arbitraged between the two payment methods on Bisq, '''before''' accounting for fees.\n# Repeat as long as the profitable spread exists.\n\n## Risks and Considerations\n\nWhile arbitrage aims to be low-risk by locking in profits from existing price differences, several practical factors introduce risk and complexity, especially on a P2P platform like Bisq:\n\n* '''Execution Risk:''' Prices can change quickly. Delay in executing one leg of the arbitrage (e.g., your external market buy fills but your Bisq sell offer gets taken by someone else before you can place it, or vice-versa) can erase the profit or lead to a loss. Getting both sides filled simultaneously at the desired prices can be challenging.\n* '''Fees:''' Remember to account for all fees:\n* Bisq trading fees (maker/taker, paid in BTC or BSQ).\n* Bitcoin mining fees (for deposit and payout transactions in Bisq v1).\n* Fees associated with the specific payment methods used (both on Bisq and external exchanges).\n* Fees on the external exchange (Market X).\n* '''Capital Requirements:''' You need sufficient capital available on both platforms/payment methods simultaneously to execute both legs of the trade (BTC and/or fiat).\n* '''Counterparty Risk (Bisq v1):''' While security deposits mitigate risk, trades can still go to dispute resolution, potentially tying up your funds (including deposits) for some time. Ensure you understand the risks associated with the specific payment methods and trade protocol.\n* '''Settlement Times:''' Fiat payment methods have varying settlement times. An arbitrage might require managing cash flow across methods that settle at different speeds.\n\nSuccessful arbitrage requires careful calculation, quick execution, and a good understanding of the platforms and payment methods involved.\n\n*For more short guides see Howto.

{"title": "BSQ swaps", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\n'''BSQ swaps''' allow BSQ colored bitcoin and BTC to be traded atomically: instantly, risklessly, with less fees, and with no special Bisq account setup required.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Process\n\nWith the BSQ swap protocol, BSQ and BTC can be traded in a single transaction without much of the baggage of the conventional trade protocol.\n\nFrom a user's perspective, the process is rather seamless. No special payment accounts need to be created. The offer maker creates the offer (BSQ is default trade currency).\n\n600px|thumb|left|Creating a BSQ swap offer.\n\nAs long as the offer maker has enough of what they want to trade in their wallet (either BTC or BSQ), the offer will be live and visible on the network. If the relevant wallet balance ever goes below the amount required to complete the swap, the swap offer automatically deactivates.\n* if a user creates a swap offer to sell 1000 BSQ, the offer will remain live as long as their BSQ wallet has more than 1000 BSQ\n* if a user creates a swap offer to buy 0.5 BTC, the offer will remain live as long as their Bisq BTC wallet has more than 0.5 BTC\n\nOffers can still be activated or deactivated manually in <code>Portfolio</code> > <code>My Open Offers</code> as usual.\n\nTaken offers show in a new <code>BSQ Swap Trades</code> tab on the <code>Portfolio</code> screen.\n\nOf course, this trade protocol can only work while both users are online, but Bisq offers can only be taken when both maker and taker are online anyway, and these trades can be settled almost instantly so there is no further expectation that users be online for any particular amount of time (e.g. for 1 hour with instant altcoins offers).\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSince the protocol is trustless, BSQ swaps do not require Bisq's conventional dispute resolution.\n\nRarely, an invalid transaction could be committed to your wallet. In such a case, you will need to resync your SPV file to get rid of it.\n\n## Background\n\n## = Transaction structure\n=\n\nHere we cover the basic mechanics of BSQ swaps.\n\nBTC buyers and sellers need to pay BTC mining fees and BSQ trading fees, but the BSQ swap protocol simplifies the transaction by only having BTC inputs for BTC sellers and BSQ inputs for BSQ sellers. The appropriate deductions are made from the outputs (e.g. the BTC buyer/BSQ seller gets BTC with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted; similarly, the BTC seller/BSQ buyer gets BSQ with their share of mining fees and trading fees deducted).\n\nNow let us examine an example trade to see the structure of such a transaction.\n\nThis is how a transaction for a 1 BTC/50,000 BSQ swap with a 0.5 BSQ maker fee and 1.5 BSQ taker fee would look. We estimate the buyer's share of the mining fee to be 2000 sats and the seller's share of the mining fee to be 2500 sats.\n\nAssuming Alice makes an offer to buy BTC (sell BSQ) and Bob takes her offer (making him BTC seller/BSQ buyer):\n\n* Alice's BSQ input(s): min. 50,000 BSQ + 0.5 BSQ trade fee\n* Bob's BTC input(s): min. 1 BTC + 2500 sat - 150 sat (his BSQ trade fee will be used for mining fee, so he needs a bit less of a mining fee)\n* Bob's BSQ payout output: 50,000 BSQ - 1.5 BSQ trade fee\n* Alice's BSQ change output: xxx BSQ - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact\n* Alice's BTC payout output: 1 BTC - 2000 sat miner fee + 50 sat from BSQ fee\n* Bob's BTC change output: yyy BTC - optional, can be omitted in case input was exact\n\n## = Spam prevention\n=\n\nWith the conventional Bisq trade protocol, the maker fee transaction acts as a spam prevention measure: you cannot create an offer without spending bitcoin.\n\nThe BSQ swap protocol has no such transaction, so instead, a proof-of-work (POW) mechanism is used. The difficulty level (number of leading zeros) is set in the filter. When creating an offer, the maker does the required POW and attaches the resulting data to their offer. Each node verifies the POW and only shows offers with valid POW.\n\nIf POW difficulty is increased, offer makers must re-do their POW in the background and republish their offers. Old offers are removed from the network and new offers with new POW are added.\n\nEach offer has a counter appended to its offer ID (after the version number, in the full offer ID) each time a new POW is completed. This enables each re-published offer with new POW to have a new offer ID that looks the same to users (since the short offer ID doesn't change).\n\nAt first, POW difficulty will be set to a very low value so users do not notice anything (low milliseconds on modern laptop hardware), but will be increased as needed.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Bisq 2", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBisq 2 is the successor to the original Bisq (Bisq v1). It has been developed from the ground up to allow for multiple trade protocols to be accessed via a single decentralized exchange platform.\n\nAt the initial launch of Bisq 2 will support only one trading protocol 'Bisq Easy'. Over time more trading protocols will be added.\n\nOnce the Bisq Multisig protocol is implemented in Bisq 2, the old version of Bisq can fade out. Bisq 1 will still find its usage as Bisq DAO management tool and for BSQ-BTC trading.\n\nSimilar to Bisq v1, Bisq 2 will be a decentralized bitcoin exchange that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies.\n\n* Bisq 2 is a desktop application that works across platforms.\n* Bisq 2 allows users to choose between multiple trading protocols to find the best fit for their preference. Aspects like privacy and security, convenience, costs and trade duration will differ and the user can make the choice.\n* Bisq 2 is a peer-to-peer network that enables users to find people to trade with, make and take offers to buy and sell bitcoin, communicate with their trading peers and when necessary access support.\n* Bisq 2 is privacy focused, no verified accounts or KYC will be required and run over the Tor network (as well as I2P in future).\n* Bisq 2 is self custodial. Your keys are always under your control.\n* Bisq 2 is open source (AGPL) and built and maintained by contributors who form the Bisq DAO.\n\n## Why Bisq 2?\n\nBisq v1 is a powerful tool for bitcoiners that want to be able to buy and sell bitcoin peer to peer whilst maintaining their privacy, not having to undergo arduous KYC processes, and keeping control of their bitcoin.\n\nBisq v1 was launched on mainnet in April 2016 and whilst there has been constant improvements to the trade protocol and user interface over the years it was designed from the outset to support only one trade protocol. As bitcoin has developed and Bisq user base has grown there has been an obvious need for Bisq to expand its offerings to offer more options to its users for example trades over lightning and access via mobile devices. Bisq 2 is the first step to develop something that is built from the ground up to be more accessible to users and provide access to multiple trading protocols that can expand over time.\n\nThe core benefits of Bisq 2 are:\n\n## = Multiple Trade Protocols\n=\n\nBisq 2 will offer a variety of trade protocols for users. Each trade protocol will come with its own benefits and tradeoffs. Having multiple protocols allows users to choose what trade protocols are best for them based on; convenience, security, miner costs, trade fees, privacy, available support etc. All trade protocols can be accessed independently and users can switch between protocols for different trades.\n\nThe follow trade protocols are on the roadmap:\n\n* Bisq Easy: Reputation based trading with no security deposit requirements (included in the initial launch)\n* Bisq Multisig: Similar to the current trade protocol used by Bisq 1 but with some improvements\n\n* Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC <-> mainnet BTC\n\n* Liquid Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC <-> Liquid BTC\n\n* Liquid Multisig: Bisq Multisig ported to Liquid network with faster confirmation, lower fees and better privacy (confidential transactions)\n\n* Bisq Lightning: LN BTC <-> Fiat (chain of multiple protocols: Liquid Submarine Swaps, Liquid Multisig)\n* Liquid Swaps: Atomic swap of Liquid BTC <-> Liquid assets like L-USDT\n\n* BSQ Swaps: Atomic swap of BSQ <-> BTC\n* Monero Swaps: Cross chain atomic swap of BTC <-> XMR\n\nFind out more about the trade protocols Bisq 2 will use.\n\n## = Multiple privacy networks\n=\nBisq 2 will support multiple privacy networks. Initially it will only support Tor but I2P support is already implemented but in an experimental state. Upcoming privacy networks like Nym could be added in future if they fit the requirements.\n\nHaving multiple networks adds resilience in case one network has availability issues (as it happened multiple times with Tor when DoS attacks decreased the Tor network stability and with that Bisq's availability and stability).\n\nThe P2P network has also a built in DoS protection using Proof of Work and comes with many improvements compared to the Bisq 1 P2P network.\n\n## =Multiple Identities\n=\n\nBisq 1 used a single onion address and key pair which represent the user's identity. Bisq 2 will allow users to create multiple identities, giving the user more control and better privacy. The user can choose between the highest level of convenience and use just one global identity for all interactions (like Bisq 1) or at the other extreme use a separate identity for any type of interaction (e.g. use a different identity for each trade as well as for each chat room). And anything in between (separating fiat and altcoin trades,...).\n\nFind out more about how Bisq 2 manages identities.\n\n## = Multiple applications\n=\n\nThe reference implementation will be the Bisq 2 JavaFx desktop application.\n\nBut there is also ongoing work on a HTML interface with a headless application to be used on personal Node projects like Start9, Umbrel, MyNode,...\n\nBeside that there will be a REST API (useful for trading bots,...).\n\nBisq Easy can be implemented as a mobile app (at least for Android there are no conceptual or technical hurdles).\n\n## = Multiple wallets\n=\n\nAt launch time Bisq 2 will not include a wallet, but work is underway to support multiple wallet options.\n\nBitcoin core as a full wallet is already implemented (but not exposed in the UI). For users who do not want to run a full Bitcoin node, there will be a light wallet option. Currently Electrum is implemented but we might change to another solution.\n\nFor the different trade protocols there will be the specific wallets required. E.g. for Liquid the Elements wallet is already integrated. For Monero Swaps we need to provide an interface for using the Monero wallet. Find out more about the Bisq 2 wallet.\n\n## = Bonded Roles\n=\n\nThe contributors providing the resources and infrastructure for Bisq 2 will require their roles to be bonded. This concept was also used in Bisq 1 but as it was not strictly enforced by the system, not all roles are secured by bonds as it was envisioned. In Bisq 2 having set up a BSQ bond is mandatory for most roles and node operators and enforced by the system.\n\nFind out more about the Bisq 2 roles.\n\n## Bisq 1 vs Bisq 2\n\nWhen Bisq 2 is launched it will initially only use the one trade protocol 'Bisq Easy' therefore the differences are based on a 2-of-2 multisig protocol (Bisq 1) vs a reputation based trade protocol (Bisq Easy).\n\n## Bisq Easy\n\nBisq Easy was designed for new Bitcoin users who have not yet purchased Bitcoin and therefore cannot use Bisq 1 due the requirements of the security deposit. A lot of effort was put into making it as simple to use as possible.\n\nBisq Easy tries to replicate the experience of a novice Bitcoiner visiting a Bitcoin meetup and getting a gentle and friendly introduction into the Bitcoin world as well as the opportunity to purchase their first Bitcoin from a helpful peer. This is inspired by the famous Satoshi Squares (early days informal Bitcoin meetups), which was also the initial name inspiration for Bitsquare - the previous brand name of Bisq.\n\nThe seller is expected to be an experienced Bitcoin and Bisq user and to have built up a reputation. The seller should be helpful and serve as guide through the newbie's first Bitcoin trade.\n\nBisq Easy tries to be a much more social experience as it is the case on Bisq 2. It also provides a \"learn\" section where newbies can learn about important topics like wallets, privacy and security. The various sections for chat rooms should also boost the social and communicative aspect of Bisq Easy.\n\n## = Main differences for BTC buyers\n=\n\nInitially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow for users to buy bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no miner fees. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to buy bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs.\n\nThe tradeoff for Bisq 2 is that the security of the trade will be based on seller reputation as opposed to Bisq 1 where the security of the trade is based on bitcoin collateral secured in the multisig.\n\nTherefore, Bisq 2 will be cheaper and more convenient to trade for bitcoin buyers but at the cost of less robust security than Bisq 1. This is opposed to Bisq 1 that will be more secure but also more expensive, in terms of trade and miner fees, and less convenient for bitcoin buyers.\n\nBisq 2 will initially be more suitable for users wanting to complete trades for small amounts of bitcoin, whereas, Bisq 1 will continue to be suitable for users wanting to complete trades for larger amounts of bitcoin.\n\n## = Main differences for BTC sellers\n=\n\nInitially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow users to sell bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no security deposit. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to sell bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs.\n\nSellers on Bisq 2 will be expected to build their reputation. This can be done in multiple ways but to achieve a high reputation they will need to either burn BSQ and / or create a BSQ bond that locks in a specific amount of BSQ for a specified length of time.\n\nThe first iteration of Bisq 2 will have more buyers than sellers. That means a small number of sellers will be servicing the buyers. Bitcoin sellers on Bisq 2 will be required to make a judgement on how best to achieve their reputation and what the cost of doing so will involve. Bitcoin seller's using Bisq 2 will also need to account for the fact that bitcoin buyers are not putting down a security deposit for their trades so there will likely be a higher trade abandonment than in Bisq 1.\n\nIt is expected that some bitcoin sellers currently active on Bisq 1 may choose to experiment with Bisq 2, and the number of buyers and sellers on Bisq 2 will grow over time.\n\nAs in Bisq 1 seller's will be able to choose the price above or below market they wish to sell their bitcoin for.\n\nDue to the requirements on bonds and the potential higher effort on communication with a newbie Bitcoiner, the price premium can be expected to be much higher than in Bisq 1 (maybe 10-15% above market). The Seller is the one who sets the price.\n\n## How Bisq 2 keeps data private\n\nBisq 2 achieves data privacy for users in the same way as Bisq 1:\n\n* Using Bisq requires no registration or centralized identity verification\n* Every Bisq application connects to the Bisq network with a Tor hidden service (as well as I2P in future)\n* Bisq has no central servers or databases to record data\n* Data is encrypted such that trade details are readable only by counter-parties\n\n## How Bisq 2 resists censorship\n\nBisq 2 achieves censorship resistance in the same way as Bisq 1:\n\n* Bisq’s network is a fully distributed P2P network, and thus difficult to shut down\n* Bisq’s network is built on top of Tor (I2P), and thus inherits Tor’s own censorship resistance\n* Bisq is an open source project and a DAO, not a company; it is not incorporated, and thus cannot be dis-incorporated\n\n## Advanced configurations for Bisq 2\n\nFor users that want to tinker with the default config setting. Bisq 2 supports users to add a config file in the data directory which overrides the default config.\n\nThis can be useful instead of dealing with command line options. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.\n\nFor more info see the GitHub pull request [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/pull/2201 here].\n\n## Installation\n\n## = Download and verify\n=\n\nBisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.\n\nTo import the key in Linux and MacOS:\n\n<code>curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import </code>\n\nGPG will return \"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\", this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)\n\nTo verify the installer against the signature:\n\n<code>gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}</code>\n\nReplace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.\n\nIn Windows you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].\n\n## = Known issues with installation\n=\n\n'''MacOS'''\n\nNotarization was removed from the build pipeline because of the risk of Apple certification revocation ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions/6341 GitHub issue]). Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS.\n\nPlease follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section \"If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer\".\n\nIf you are using macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to execute the following in your terminal to be able to start Bisq 2:\n\n<code>sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq2.app</code>\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your password to execute the command as super user, and this should allow you to start Bisq 2 normally.\n\n'''Windows'''\n\nThe developer code signing was removed for the same reason as above. You can ignore the warning after having verified the installer.\n\nThere are known issues with antivirus software: Bisq or Tor processes could be prevented from running, files could get deleted in the data directory [2] or the application directory [1]), or startup could be delayed to the point that Tor is terminated, and a lockfile is left behind preventing Bisq from being started again (this requires you to restart Windows in order to remove the lockfile). These issues are currently being evaluated and addressed.\n\nWindows suffers from a much wider attack surface compared to Linux or OSX, please consider using a different operating system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.\n\n[1] Application directory (contains application installation files): C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Bisq2\n\n[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data): C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bisq2\n\n'''Linux'''\n\nDebian users: if you have issues starting Bisq, run <code>/opt/bisq2/bin/Bisq2</code>\n\nIf your Linux distribution does not support .deb files please follow these instructions:\n\n<code>\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nmkdir tmp\n\ncd tmp\n\nar x ../Bisq-64bit-2.1.2.deb\n\nsudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz\n\nsudo cp -rp opt/Bisq2 /opt/\n</code>\n\nThe above is not tested in all distributions, if you encounter issues please report them [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/issues here].", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Bisq Easy", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2, designed to facilitate the acquisition of bitcoin with zero trade fees and without the requirement of a security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol intended for novice bitcoin buyers seeking a non-KYC option and aiming to be efficiently onboarded by experienced and knowledgeable sellers that are familiar with the Bisq platform.\n\nBisq Easy is currently the only trade protocol for Bisq 2. More trade protocols are planned for the future.\n\n## Bisq Easy Trade Protocol Specifics\n\n## = Trade fees\n=\n\nThere are no trade fees for buyers or sellers for trading on Bisq Easy.\n\n## = Mining fees\n=\n\nBuyers will not have to pay any mining fees when they trade on Bisq Easy.\n\nSellers will need to pay any fees required to send the bitcoin to the buyer after receiving their payment.

For lighting transactions the seller is responsible for paying any routing fees needed to pay the buyer's ln invoice.\n\n## = Security mechanisms\n=\n\nThe security of the trade is proportional to the reputation of the seller.\n\nAs Bisq Easy is reputation based, and reputation provides a fairly low security model, it means traders on Bisq Easy are suited only to rather small amounts of bitcoin.\n\nBy default buyers can only exchange messages with sellers that have a certain level of reputation, however, buyers can opt-out from that protection.\n\nTrading with sellers without reputation, or very low reputation, carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.\n\n## = Currencies / Payment Methods\n=\n\nBisq Easy buyers and sellers can trade bitcoin for any type of fiat.\n\nFiat buyers and sellers can choose whatever type of payment method they agree upon for fiat transfer.\n\n## = Dispute mechanisms\n=\n\nBuyers and sellers trading on Bisq Easy can access mediation support should anything go wrong with their trade.\n\nMediators will be able to:\n\n* Help facilitate the successful completion of the trade\n* Confirm fiat / altcoin and bitcoin payments\n* Help cancel trade if needed\n* Report a trader who severely violated the trade rules to the moderator who can ban the user.\n\nDepending on the form of reputation used, a fraudulent seller can get their bonded BSQ confiscated by the DAO or their Bisq 1 onion address banned.

It is also the right option if you don't find any offers with the right premium or payment methods in the market you want to trade in. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and create a new offer in it:\n\nBegin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select ''Bisq Easy'' on the left panel, and ''Offerbook'' on the top tab.\n\nframeless\n\nEach different national currency has its own market. You can click on the displayed pair to open a selector where you can choose the currency you would like to trade in. In this example, we are interested in buying some Bitcoin by paying with Euros, so we will select the ''BTC/EUR'' pair, but you should select whatever currency you are using. Afterward, click on the ''Create offer'' button on the right-hand side.\n\nframeless\n\nYou will now enter the offer creation wizard. The first step will be to choose between buying or selling Bitcoin. Select ''Buy Bitcoin'' and click on ''Next''.\n\nframeless\n\nOn the following screen, you will be asked for confirmation on which currency you want to pay your Bitcoin with. The selected currency will be the one you selected in the previous ''Offerbook'' screen. You can change your mind here if needed. Since for this example we want to move forward with Euros, we don't need to change anything on this screen, and we can simply click ''Next''.\n\nframeless\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods are you willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select ''SEPA'' and ''Revolut''.\n\nframeless\n\nBesides the presented Payment Methods, you can also add customized Payment Methods to your offer. For instance, for this offer, I would be happy to make a cash deposit at a Rabobank physical branch. I can use the bottom input to add this method to my offer.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking ''Next''.\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is . You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.\n\nframeless\n\nYou also have the option of defining a range instead of a fixed value for the trade amount. By doing that, you set a minimum and maximum amount, and you signal to the market that you are willing to trade any amount between those two numbers. For this example, we will create an offer with a range between 100€ and 200€. Once you have set your fixed value or a range, click ''Next'' to move on.\n\nframeless\n\nWith this, you will reach the final step of the offer creation wizard. The final screen shows a summary of all the details you have defined. Now is the time for you to review whether everything is fine. This is important because, once you click on ''Create offer'', the offer will be available for anyone to take and, once that happens, it will be binding. So, make sure you are happy with the details you see. Once you are sure, click on ''Create offer'' and your offer will be added to the market.\n\nframeless\n\nYour order is finally ready. Now, you will have to wait until another peer takes it. If your offer remains unpicked for longer than you would like to, consider modifying it to add additional payment methods or adding a more flexible range of values that could attract different users.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce a peer takes your offer, you will receive a notification and be able to see the started trade in the ''Open Trades'' panel of Bisq Easy. Also, keep in mind that offers remain open until you close them. If you only want to transact once, you should close it after it gets taken, or more peers could keep taking it!\n\n## = Taking an offer\n=\n\nTaking an existing offer is the fastest and simplest way to find a partner and start trading. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and pick an existing offer in it.\n\nBegin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select ''Bisq Easy'' on the left panel, and ''Getting started'' on the top tab.\n\nframeless\n\nOn this page, click on the ''Start trade wizard''. This is the easiest way to get started. A small note: once you become more experienced, you might prefer to use the ''Offerbook'' page to do your trades. But for the first trades, we advise using the trade wizard.\n\nframeless\n\nWith this, you will enter the trade wizard, which will guide you step by step through the process of taking an existing offer to buy some Bitcoin. In the first screen, select ''Buy Bitcoin'' and click on ''Next''.\n\nframeless\n\nIn the following screen, you need to indicate which national currency you want to use to pay your trading partner. Since we want to use Euros for this trade, we select that currency in the list. Once you have selected your currency, click on ''Next'' to move on.\n\nframeless\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to select which Payment Methods you are willing to use. You should select at least one, but you can also select multiple of them. The more Payment Methods you add, the more chances you will have of finding a willing trade peer. In this example, we initially select ''SEPA'' and ''Revolut''.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce you are done selecting Payment Methods, you can move on by clicking ''Next''.\n\nOn the next screen, you will have to set how much Bitcoin you want to buy or, putting it the other way around, how much fiat currency you want to sell. The minimum trade amount on Bisq Easy is the equivalent of 6 USD and the maximum amount is . You can write the fiat amount, the BTC amount, or simply move the slider around.\n\nframeless\n\nFor this example, let's imagine we would like to buy 150€ worth of Bitcoin. We set the value and click on ''Next'' to move on.\n\nIn the following screen, you will be presented a list of offers that match your needs. You can select any of the offers presented, but we advise taking the first offer. By default, offers will be presented by decreasing reputation, so the most trusted trades will be on the top of the list. You can check other offers that might have more interesting prices, but be aware that the lower the reputation of the trader, the higher the risk you will face. If you want to keep things safe and simple, simply pick the first offer that you see. Once you have settled for an offer, click on ''Next'' to move on.\n\nframeless\n\nThe final screen will allow you to review all the details. Make sure you are happy with all the details of the trade, since once you move on, you will effectively commit to doing the trade. If there's anything you want to change, you can always navigate back and modify any of the trade details. Once you are ready, click on ''Confirm trade''.\n\nframeless\n\nOnce you have done this, the offer is taken and you can begin the trade process. You can read more about the trade process here: Trade Process.\n\nRemember that when you take an offer, you commit to follow through. Be aware that, once you take it, you can't simply back down without consequences.\n\nNote that there is also a chance that no offers are found matching your needs. If this is the case, you will see a screen like the one below. You can wait some time and try again later, or you can instead create your own offer. You can read more about creating an offer here Creating a buy offer.\n\nframeless\n\n## How to sell bitcoin on Bisq Easy\n\nUsers of Bisq Easy can both make an offer to sell bitcoin, or take an offer from a user looking to buy bitcoin.\n\nSeller's on Bisq Easy will usually be experienced Bisq users. It is expected they will be helpful and supportive to buyers who are new to Bitcoin and/or Bisq. Bisq Easy seller's should be passionate about helping new Bisq users smoothly acquire no KYC bitcoin in a peer to peer manner.\n\nAs building reputation incurs costs for the bitcoin sellers. It is expected that they will sell bitcoin at a premium of about 10-15%. The premium reflects the additional costs and compensates sellers for the on-boarding service they provide.\n\n## Trade Process\n\nTrade process for Bisq Easy is as follows:\n\n* The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker's user profile.\n* Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.\n* The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.\n* The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the seller's account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.\n* Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyer's address.\n* After the buyer receives the Bitcoin the trade is completed.\n\n## Trade Rules\n\nBisq Easy trading rules are as follows:\n\n* Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.\n* After the payment details are exchanged, not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.\n* When sending the Fiat, the buyer MUST fill in the payment reason field with the Trade ID string, which can be found under Bisq Easy > MY OPEN TRADES (this is to prevent triangle scams), and MUST NOT use any term related to 'Bitcoin', 'Bisq' or 'Trade'.\n* If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.\n* If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the Matrix channel.\n\n## Chat Rules\n\nBisq Easy has the following chat rules it expects traders to follow:\n\n* Be respectful: Always treat others with kindness and respect. Avoid offensive language, personal attacks, and harassment. Remember that behind every screen is a real person with feelings.\n* No spamming: Please refrain from flooding the chat with repetitive or irrelevant messages. Keeping the conversation meaningful and on-topic helps everyone engage in a more constructive manner.\n* No advertising: We kindly ask you to avoid promoting products, services, or posting external links. This ensures that the focus remains on meaningful discussions rather than promotional content.\n* No hate speech: We have zero tolerance for content that promotes discrimination, hate speech, or violence against any individual or group. Let's foster an inclusive and supportive community.\n* No trolling: Disruptive behavior, trolling, or intentionally provoking others disrupts the positive atmosphere we aim to maintain. Let's all strive for respectful and constructive interactions.\n* Keep it safe: Protect your privacy and that of others by not sharing personal information such as phone numbers, addresses or any other sensitive data in the chat. Safety first!\n* Respect privacy: Do not share private conversations or screenshots without consent. Respecting each other's privacy is a cornerstone of trust.\n* Report misconduct: If you witness any violations of these rules or encounter inappropriate behavior, please report it to the moderator.

Let's create a community we can all be proud to be a part of.\n\nRemember, by participating in the chat, you agree to abide by these rules. Failure to comply may result in warnings, temporary mute, or ban from the Bisq network.\n\n## How to stay safe on Bisq Easy\n\nHere are some tips for keeping safe when trading on Bisq Easy and avoiding any scams.\n\n## = Tips for bitcoin buyers\n=\n\nBitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before sending any bitcoin. For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.\n\n# Start with a small amount as a test trade\n# Start chatting with the seller before sending the fiat payment to check that they are still active\n# Choose a seller with a high reputation. The higher the reputation of the seller the better. Sellers need a minimum reputation score of 30,000, ideally you should be choosing to trade with someone higher than this. Look at the star system for guidance. It will be safer to trade with a 5 star rated seller than a 1 star rated seller.\n# Send payment as soon as possible once you have the seller's account details.\n# Only send payment to the account details provided by the Seller in the trade chat window. If the seller is trying to change the account they want you to send payment to, it would be better to cancel the trade and open a new trade with another seller.\n# Place the trade ID from Bisq Easy in the payment reason.\n# Send the payment from the same account you share the information with in trader chat. For example if you are having problems with the payment do not send payment from your partners, business, friends etc account. Instead try and resolve the issue so you can send payment from the correct account and failing that open mediation to get additional support.\n# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the seller via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.\n# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.\n\n## = Tips for bitcoin sellers\n=\n\nAlthough bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before bitcoin sellers send them any bitcoin, sellers should still be aware of buyers attempting any charge-back scams. There is almost no cost for a bitcoin buyer to create an account and start making trades, therefore, there is little for a buyer to lose by attempting a scam. Almost all buyers on Bisq Easy will be honest but it is still good to be cautious.\n\nFor this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.\n\n# Be careful when dealing with buyers with brand new accounts (the buyer's account age is shown in their profile).\n# Avoid payment methods that have a high possibility of charge-backs eg; PayPal, Venmo\n# Make sure the payment you receive matches the buyers account details. Avoid sending bitcoin to buyer's with mis-matching account details. It would be better to refund the payment to the account you received the payment from and cancel the trade.\n# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the buyer via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.\n# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.\n# If you have any concerns about a trade open mediation.", "category": "bisq1"}

It is expected they will be helpful and supportive to buyers who are new to Bitcoin and/or Bisq. Bisq Easy seller's should be passionate about helping new Bisq users smoothly acquire no KYC bitcoin in a peer to peer manner.\n\nAs building reputation incurs costs for the bitcoin sellers. It is expected that they will sell bitcoin at a premium of about 10-15%. The premium reflects the additional costs and compensates sellers for the on-boarding service they provide.\n\n## Trade Process\n\nTrade process for Bisq Easy is as follows:\n\n* The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker's user profile.\n* Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.\n* The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.\n* The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the seller's account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.\n* Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyer's address.\n* After the buyer receives the Bitcoin the trade is completed.\n\n## Trade Rules\n\nBisq Easy trading rules are as follows:\n\n* Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.\n* After the payment details are exchanged, not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.\n* When sending the Fiat, the buyer MUST fill in the payment reason field with the Trade ID string, which can be found under Bisq Easy > MY OPEN TRADES (this is to prevent triangle scams), and MUST NOT use any term related to 'Bitcoin', 'Bisq' or 'Trade'.\n* If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.\n* If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the Matrix channel.\n\n## Chat Rules\n\nBisq Easy has the following chat rules it expects traders to follow:\n\n* Be respectful: Always treat others with kindness and respect. Avoid offensive language, personal attacks, and harassment. Remember that behind every screen is a real person with feelings.\n* No spamming: Please refrain from flooding the chat with repetitive or irrelevant messages. Keeping the conversation meaningful and on-topic helps everyone engage in a more constructive manner.\n* No advertising: We kindly ask you to avoid promoting products, services, or posting external links. This ensures that the focus remains on meaningful discussions rather than promotional content.\n* No hate speech: We have zero tolerance for content that promotes discrimination, hate speech, or violence against any individual or group. Let's foster an inclusive and supportive community.\n* No trolling: Disruptive behavior, trolling, or intentionally provoking others disrupts the positive atmosphere we aim to maintain. Let's all strive for respectful and constructive interactions.\n* Keep it safe: Protect your privacy and that of others by not sharing personal information such as phone numbers, addresses or any other sensitive data in the chat. Safety first!\n* Respect privacy: Do not share private conversations or screenshots without consent. Respecting each other's privacy is a cornerstone of trust.\n* Report misconduct: If you witness any violations of these rules or encounter inappropriate behavior, please report it to the moderator. Your vigilance helps maintain a friendly and safe community.\n* Follow moderator's Instructions: Our moderators are here to ensure a positive environment. Please comply with any instructions or guidelines they provide to maintain order and respect.\n* Enjoy the chat: Above all, we encourage you to engage in meaningful discussions, make friends, and have fun in a positive and inclusive environment. Let's create a community we can all be proud to be a part of.\n\nRemember, by participating in the chat, you agree to abide by these rules. Failure to comply may result in warnings, temporary mute, or ban from the Bisq network.\n\n## How to stay safe on Bisq Easy\n\nHere are some tips for keeping safe when trading on Bisq Easy and avoiding any scams.\n\n## = Tips for bitcoin buyers\n=\n\nBitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before sending any bitcoin. For this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.\n\n# Start with a small amount as a test trade\n# Start chatting with the seller before sending the fiat payment to check that they are still active\n# Choose a seller with a high reputation. The higher the reputation of the seller the better. Sellers need a minimum reputation score of 30,000, ideally you should be choosing to trade with someone higher than this. Look at the star system for guidance. It will be safer to trade with a 5 star rated seller than a 1 star rated seller.\n# Send payment as soon as possible once you have the seller's account details.\n# Only send payment to the account details provided by the Seller in the trade chat window. If the seller is trying to change the account they want you to send payment to, it would be better to cancel the trade and open a new trade with another seller.\n# Place the trade ID from Bisq Easy in the payment reason.\n# Send the payment from the same account you share the information with in trader chat. For example if you are having problems with the payment do not send payment from your partners, business, friends etc account. Instead try and resolve the issue so you can send payment from the correct account and failing that open mediation to get additional support.\n# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the seller via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.\n# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.\n\n## = Tips for bitcoin sellers\n=\n\nAlthough bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment before bitcoin sellers send them any bitcoin, sellers should still be aware of buyers attempting any charge-back scams. There is almost no cost for a bitcoin buyer to create an account and start making trades, therefore, there is little for a buyer to lose by attempting a scam. Almost all buyers on Bisq Easy will be honest but it is still good to be cautious.\n\nFor this reason they should take steps to ensure their trades are successful.\n\n# Be careful when dealing with buyers with brand new accounts (the buyer's account age is shown in their profile).\n# Avoid payment methods that have a high possibility of charge-backs eg; PayPal, Venmo\n# Make sure the payment you receive matches the buyers account details. Avoid sending bitcoin to buyer's with mis-matching account details. It would be better to refund the payment to the account you received the payment from and cancel the trade.\n# Keep the trade chat limited to using Bisq 2. Do not communicate with the buyer via WhatsApp, Matrix etc as it will make mediation much harder if there is an issue.\n# Avoid trading off platform with any Bisq sellers.\n# If you have any concerns about a trade open mediation.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Trade Protocols", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBisq 2 will offer users the choice of multiple trade protocols.\n\nA trade protocol serves as the fundamental framework for trading Bitcoin in a secure way. Each trade protocol presents its own set of advantages and trade-offs including:\n\n* Trade fees\n* Mining fees\n* Security mechanisms\n* Dispute mechanisms\n* Security deposit requirements\n* Privacy benefits / trade-offs\n* Convenience\n\nBisq 2 offers users the flexibility to select the optimal protocol aligning with their requirements and preferences.\n\nAll trade protocols will be able to be accessed from the Bisq 2 application independently. Users will be able to switch between trade protocols for different trades should they wish.\n\nAs of now, Bisq Easy stands as the sole implemented protocol, tailored for novice Bitcoin users and suitable for smaller trade amounts.\n\n## Bisq Easy\n\nBisq Easy will be the first trade protocol for Bisq 2. It will be accessible on the launch of Bisq 2. It is an easy to use chat based trade protocol for buying and selling bitcoin for fiat. The security is based on reputation of the sellers.\n\nSee here for more information about Bisq Easy.\n\n## Future Trade Protocols\n\nBisq is planning on adding more trade protocols available on Bisq 2. Explore the upcoming trade protocols. Keep an eye out for updates if any of the upcoming protocols catch your interest.\n\n## = Bisq Lightning\n=\n\nEscrow based trade protocol on the Lightning network using multi-party computation cryptography.\n\n## = Bisq MuSig\n=\n\nBisq 1 currently uses a 2-of-2 multisig as its main trade protocol. This involves the buyer and seller putting down a security deposit that is locked in a multisig until the trade completes. At some point this protocol will be moved over to Bisq 2.\n\n## = BSQ swaps\n=\n\nThis allows users to swap from BSQ to BTC and vice versa via atomic swaps, instantaneously and secure.\n\n## = Liquid Swaps\n=\n\nTrade any Liquid based assets like USDT and BTC-L with an atomic swap on the Liquid network.\n\n## = Monero Swaps\n=\n\nTrade Bitcoin and Monero using an atomic cross chain swap.\n\n## = Liquid MuSig\n=\n\nThis trade protocol will use the same trade protocol as the 2-of-2 multisig but it will replace Bitcoin (BTC) with Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC). The advantage to this is fees will be lower, and users will get more privacy with their trades. The disadvantage is that users will not be trading native bitcoin so will have to be comfortable holding LBTC and consider the costs of converting BTC to LBTC and back again.\n\n## = Submarine Swaps\n=\n\nThis trade protocol allows users to swap between Bitcoin on Lightning network to on-chain Bitcoin.\n\n## = Stablecoin Swaps\n=\n\nAtomic swaps between Bitcoin and USD stablecoin. Just the same as BSQ swaps, but with a Bitcoin coloured coin built on the same tech.\n\n## = Multisig Options\n=\n\nThis trade protocol would allow the creation of P2P put and call options with the buyer and seller blocking BTC in a multisig on-chain transaction. 2 PSBT would be created sending the BTC to the buyer or seller depending on the result of a binary event. On expiry a blind oracle would trigger the correct transaction to be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.\n\n## = Multisig open contracts\n=\n\nThis trade protocol will allow user defined conditional payments. Any simple contract can be created by locking funds in a multisig 2-of-3 transaction with an arbitrator holding the third key and deciding if the condition was met in case of dispute. This is similar to the old Bisq 1 2-of-3 multisig model, but open to any type of contract than can be easily verified.\n\n## Adding Trade Protocols to Bisq 2\n\nTrade protocols are designed to be modular so more trade protocols can be added in the future. Anyone with ideas for new trade protocols should join the discussion on Bisq's Matrix chat.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Identity", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nBisq 2 users are able to manage multiple identities for their trades.\n\nAt Bisq 2 launch in March 2024, the identities\n\n## What are Identities in Bisq 2\n\nIdentities in Bisq 2 allow users to create multiple identifies that can be totally independent of each other. Each identity in Bisq 2 has it's own unique onion address (this allows for users to receive and broadcast information over the [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor hidden service network]). Each identity will have it's own:\n\n* Username (chosen by the user)\n* Avatar (chosen by the user)\n* Onion address (chosen by the software)\n* Profile ID (chosen by the software)\n\nIn Bisq 1 to achieve multiple identities a user would have to have multiple Bisq instances. With Bisq 2 multiple identities can be created and used via just the one instance of Bisq 2. This allows for easy switching between profiles and having different types of trades, payment methods, protocols utilized by various profiles. This will give users greater control over their privacy\n\n## What Trade Protocols will use Identities\n\nCurrently it will just be Bisq Easy as that is the only available protocol on Bisq 2.\n\n## Building reputation for your Identities\n\nCurrently it will only be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy that will be interested in building up reputation specific to their identity/s. For more information see: reputation.\n\n## Benefits of Identities\n\nThe benefits of being able to have multiple identities means that a user has greater control over their privacy.\n\nA user could have:\n\nProfile 1: Used for buying bitcoin\nProfile 2: Used for selling bitcoin\n\nOR\n\nProfile 1: Used for buying bitcoin with a personal account\nProfile 2: Used for buying bitcoin with a business account\nProfile 3: Used for buying bitcoin with a spouses account\n\nOR\n\nProfile 1: Used for selling bitcoin for Euros\nProfile 2: Used for selling bitcoin for British Pounds\nProfile 3: Used for selling bitcoin for US Dollars\n\nOR\n\nProfile 1: Used for buying bitcoin on Bisq Easy\nProfile 2: Used for atomic swap protocols\n\nAllowing the creation of different multiple identities gives users complete control over what information / data they want to assign to which profile. It is also easy to delete a profile and start a new one at any point.\n\n## Negatives of Identities\n\nReputation built up overtime for bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy is specific to a specific identity. This means that bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will become invested in building up their identities reputation. This is positive for the protocol as a reputation built over time is what gives the protocol it's security mechanism, however for seller's it means that establishing a new identity will have to be done from scratch.\n\nAlthough identities give the user a separate; username, avatar, onion address, an profile ID, it does not prevent a user from mistaken linking their identities by associating their fiat accounts with their separate identities. When creating a new identity the user should be aware of what fiat information they are happy to link to each identity.\n\n## How many identities should you use\n\nIt is entirely up to the user of Bisq 2 to decide how many profiles they will need. It is expected most users will just create the one profile. However the option is there for users that want to create more for privacy or other reasons.\n\n## Creating an Identity\n\nBisq 2 will prompt you to create an identity when you first run the software.\n\nTo create an additional identity click on 'User options' > 'User profile' > 'Create new profile'\n\n## Switching between Identities\n\nIt is easy to switch between identifies by clicking on the profile avatar on the top right of Bisq 2 and selecting the profile (identity) desired. When sending messages be sure to check the correct profile is selected.\n\n## Deleting an Identity\n\nYou can delete an identity by selecting the identity you want to delete and then clicking on 'User options' > 'User profile' > 'delete profile'\n\nYou cannot delete an identity if you only have one identity.\n\nBe-aware that deleting an identity also deletes any associated reputation it has.", "category": "bisq1"}

{"title": "Bisq 2 Roles", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nIn Bisq 2, certain network functions and processes rely on contributors who take responsibility for specific '''bonded roles'''. These roles require locking BSQ as a bond, approved by the DAO, ensuring accountability and security for the network's decentralized infrastructure.\n\nThere are two main types of bonded roles in Bisq 2: System Roles and Delegable Roles.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## System Roles\n\nSystem roles must be performed by the specifically authorized contributor approved by the DAO. For security reasons, these roles cannot be delegated to others.\n\n## = Mediator\n=\n\nMediators in Bisq 2 primarily assist users of the Bisq Easy trade protocol if they encounter issues during a trade. Mediators cannot control user funds and have no direct enforcement powers. However, if a trader is behaving poorly (e.g., attempting scams), mediators can provide information to Moderators, who may then ban users for severe or repeated violations of trade rules.\n\n## = Moderator\n=\n\nModerators help ensure the smooth operation of the Bisq Easy trade protocol in Bisq 2. Their responsibilities include:\n\n* Monitoring offers to remove spam.\n* Handling reports from users or mediators regarding violations of Bisq Easy rules.\n* Investigating potential violations.\n* Banning user profile IDs found to be in violation.\n* Flagging chat messages that violate communication rules.\n\nNote: Due to Bisq 2's support for multiple identities, banning a profile ID may have limited effect, as users can potentially create new profiles.\n\n## = Security Manager\n=\n\nThe Security Manager role is similar to the \"filter operator\" role in Bisq 1. Key functions include:\n\n* Publishing data to block malicious or malfunctioning roles/nodes.\n* Halting trading for specific protocols during critical security incidents.\n* Broadcasting alert messages to the network or specific users.\n\nUsers retain control, as they can choose to deactivate the security manager's filtering influence or ignore alerts if they wish. Alert types include:\n\n* '''INFO:''' Informational popup message.\n* '''WARN:''' Warning popup message.\n* '''HALT_TRADE:''' Custom emergency popup message that disables trade operations for a specified protocol.\n* '''BAN:''' Broadcasts data about a banned role (no text message).\n\n## = Update Manager\n=\n\nThe Update Manager (or Release Manager) broadcasts notifications about new software versions to the network. Notification types include:\n\n* '''PRE_RELEASE:''' Notifies users about new pre-releases (users can opt-in via settings; default is off).\n* '''RELEASE:''' Notifies users about a new official release.\n* '''FORCED_UPDATE:''' Displays a warning popup about a mandatory update to a minimum required version. Trade operations may be halted until the user updates.\n\n## Delegable Roles\n\nDelegable roles perform tasks based on publicly available data and do not need to maintain consensus with other peers. Any user can potentially operate these roles themselves, often configured via JVM arguments.\n\n## = Seed Node\n=\n\nSeed nodes serve as initial contact points for the P2P network. They provide network routing information and filtered Bitcoin blockchain data to new nodes joining the network or light clients. When a Bisq node starts, it contacts several seed nodes to sync network data. At least one hardcoded (root) seed node is necessary for bootstrapping the network.\n\n## = Oracle Node\n=\n\nOracle nodes provide essential data services bridging Bisq 1 information and Bisq 2 functions. There must always be at least one operational oracle node. Services include:\n\n##\nDAO Bridge Service\n##\n\nThis service retrieves DAO data (like bond status and reputation events - BSQ burns/bonds) from a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts it reliably to the Bisq 2 network.\n\n* '''Verification:''' Users can independently verify the integrity of this data by querying a Bisq 1 API node themselves. If discrepancies suggesting intentionally incorrect data are found and reported, a DAO proposal can be made to confiscate the offending oracle operator's bond.\n\n##\nReputation Service\n##\n\nThis service retrieves data relevant to reputation sources like Bisq 1 account age and signed account age via a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts it to the Bisq 2 network.\n\n##\nTime-Stamping Service\n##\n\nThis service provides timestamps used for calculating the age of Bisq 2 user profiles.\n\n## = Explorer Nodes\n=\n\nExplorer nodes provide information about blockchain transaction states, used during the trade process. For example, they might inform users when a Bitcoin payment transaction receives sufficient confirmations.\n\n## = Market Price Node\n=\n\nMarket Price Nodes supply current market price information (e.g., BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) used for setting offer prices relative to the market. Because trades rely on this data, operators of these nodes are required to be bonded.\n\n## Becoming a Bonded Role Holder in Bisq 2\n\nContributors performing bonded roles are typically established Bisq contributors who have been formally approved by the DAO through a voting process. This ensures accountability for these critical network functions.\n\nThe general process is:\n\n1. A potential contributor creates a proposal outlining their intention and qualifications for a specific role on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository].\n2. The proposal is discussed publicly within the community on the GitHub issue.\n3. If there is rough consensus, the contributor then creates a formal \"Bonded Role Proposal\" within the Bisq (v1) application. They must have sufficient BSQ available to cover the required bond amount for the role.\n4. The proposal is submitted to the DAO for stakeholder voting.\n5. If the vote passes, the specified BSQ bond is automatically locked, the contributor's role is registered, and they can begin performing their duties. If rejected, the BSQ is returned.\n\nFor more general information on contributing to Bisq, see the Contributor Checklist. Note that not all contribution tasks require bonding, providing an easier path for new contributors to get involved and build reputation.\n\n## BSQ Bonding for Roles/Nodes\n\nAll System and Delegable roles described here require the contributor to lock a BSQ bond via a successful DAO vote.\n\nThe oracle node plays a key role in verifying that other bonded roles have a valid, active BSQ bond setup. However, the oracle cannot verify itself or the root seed node (due to a \"chicken and egg\" problem). These root nodes are still required to set up their own BSQ bonds independently.\n\nThe bonding process is transparent. Any user can manually verify the status of bonds for roles/nodes through the DAO section of the Bisq 1 application.\n\n## Confiscation of BSQ Bonds\n\nIf a contributor operating a bonded role acts maliciously or harmfully, any community member can propose the confiscation of their BSQ bond.\n\nThe confiscation process is as follows:\n\n1. A user posts a proposal on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository], detailing the harmful behavior and rationale for confiscation.\n2. The proposal is discussed publicly, allowing the bondholder an opportunity to respond.\n3. If rough consensus for confiscation is reached, the user requesting confiscation creates a formal \"Confiscate Bond Proposal\" in the Bisq 1 application.\n4. The proposal is submitted to the DAO for stakeholder voting.\n5. If the vote passes (meeting high thresholds detailed below), the bond is burned (destroyed), the role is unregistered, and the contributor loses their bond and ceases performing the role. If rejected, no action is taken.\n\nConfiscating a bond is a significant penalty reserved for serious offenses. To prevent misuse, the DAO requires exceptionally high support for confiscation proposals:\n* Minimum Quorum: 200,000 BSQ participating in the vote.\n* Minimum Acceptance: 85% approval (compared to >50% for typical proposals).\n\nThis system minimizes the risk of misbehavior in high-trust roles while providing a community-driven mechanism for accountability.

As buyers send their fiat payment ''before'' receiving Bitcoin, the seller's reputation provides the trust needed for the buyer to proceed confidently.\n\n600px|thumb|left|The 'Build reputation' screen in Bisq 2 (accessed via 'Reputation' on the left menu), showing the four methods available. <br clear=all>\n\n## = Why Reputation Matters\n=\n\n* '''For Buyers:''' Carefully review a seller's reputation (shown as stars) before accepting an offer. Choosing sellers with a higher reputation is crucial for minimizing trade risks.\n* '''For Sellers:''' Building and maintaining a high reputation is essential. It increases buyer trust, makes your offers more attractive, helps you get more trades, and allows you to offer larger trade amounts. Maximizing reputation is key to success as a seller on Bisq Easy. There is expected to be competition among sellers to achieve higher reputation scores.\n\n## = Reputation & Trade Rules (Version 2.1.1 and Later)\n=\n\nStarting with '''Bisq 2 version 2.1.1''', several important rules link reputation directly to trading activity (within the currently required software version):\n\n* '''Seller's Maximum Trade Amount:''' The maximum amount a seller can offer in a single trade now directly depends on their reputation score. Higher reputation allows sellers to create offers for larger amounts.\n* '''System Trade Limits:''' While a seller's maximum depends on their reputation, the overall limits for ''any'' Bisq Easy trade are fixed between the fiat equivalent of '''6 USD''' (minimum) and '''600 USD''' (maximum). This avoids issues with Bitcoin price swings. (Note: Before v2.1.1, limits were 0.0001 - 0.01 BTC).\n* '''Enhanced BSQ Value:''' To reward commitment and long-term participation, BSQ that is '''burned''' or '''bonded''' for reputation now contributes '''double its initial value''' to the score over the course of the first year (the score increases linearly during that year). This allows sellers to increase their eligible trade limits more quickly.\n* '''Minimum Score Setting Removed:''' The previous option for buyers to set a specific minimum required reputation score for sellers (formerly defaulted to 30000) was removed in v2.1.1. The system now relies on the direct link between reputation and the allowed trade amount as a better way to handle risk.\n\n400px|thumb|left|General [[Bisq Easy trade limits are 6 USD to 600 USD (or fiat equivalent). A seller's specific maximum offer size within this range depends on their reputation.]]\n400px|thumb|right|Previously, Bisq warned if trading below a set minimum score; this setting was removed in v2.1.1.\n<br clear=all>\n\n## = Understanding Reputation Stars\n=\n\nTo make reputation easy to compare quickly, Bisq Easy displays scores using a simple '''0 to 5 star system'''.\n\n400px|thumb|left|The star system (0-5) provides an easy comparison of seller reputation based on their current rank among active users. 5 stars indicate the highest relative reputation.\n\n* '''How it Works (Relative Ranking):''' Your star rating shows how your reputation '''compares to all other *active* users''' on the Bisq network at that moment. It's your current rank, not a fixed score. The highest-ranked active sellers get 5 stars, the lowest get 0 stars.\n* '''Why Stars Change (Dynamic):''' Because it's a relative system based on active users, your star rating can change even if your score hasn't:\n:'''User Inactivity:''' If a user is inactive for '''two weeks''', their profile is temporarily excluded from the ranking calculation. If a high-ranked user becomes inactive, others might see their star ratings go up.\n:'''User Reactivation:''' When an inactive user returns, their reputation is factored back in, potentially shifting star ratings again.\n\n'''In short:''' Stars give you a quick, dynamic view of a seller's current reputation rank compared to their active peers. The star display will change over time based on both your own score changes and the changing scores of other active users.\n<br clear=all>\n\n## How to Build Reputation\n\nYou can build your reputation score in Bisq Easy using four methods, accessed via the '''`Reputation`''' section on the main left-hand menu in Bisq 2. Your '''total reputation score''' is calculated as the '''sum''' of the points gained from all methods you use. This total score determines your reputation rank (stars) and your maximum trade offer size.\n\nReputation scores can change over time: points from BSQ Bonds are lost when unlocked, but you can burn or bond BSQ repeatedly. You can also import account age or signed account age, potentially replacing previous imported scores if the new import source is older.\n\n<br clear=all>\n\n## = Method 1: Burning BSQ\n=\n\nYou permanently '''burn''' BSQ tokens to gain reputation. This represents a strong, long-term commitment to the network, akin to a proof of work. Follow the process displayed in the Bisq 2 Reputation section:\n\n# '''Step 1:''' Select the user profile in Bisq 2 for which you want to attach the reputation.\n# '''Step 2:''' Copy the '''Profile ID''' displayed. You will paste this into Bisq 1.\n# '''Step 3:''' Open '''Bisq 1''' and go to `DAO` > `PROOF OF BURN`. Paste the copied Profile ID into the '''`pre-image`''' field.\n# '''Step 4:''' Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn.\n# '''Step 5:''' Publish the Burn BSQ transaction.\n# '''Step 6:''' After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your Bisq 2 profile.\n\n'''Scoring Details:'''\n* '''Initial Score:''' '''100 points''' per BSQ burned (Weight = 100).\n* '''12-Month Bonus:''' The score '''doubles''' over the first year (increasing linearly from 100 to 200 points per BSQ burned). This rewards long-term sellers.\n* '''Persistence:''' Reputation from burning BSQ is permanent for that profile (unless the profile is banned).\n* '''Cumulative:''' You can burn BSQ multiple times; scores add up.\n* '''Minimum Burn:''' 5.46 BSQ (dust limit).\n* '''Oracle Publishing:''' Data about burned BSQ is automatically published by the oracle.\n\nframe|left|Burning [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ in Bisq 1 requires your Bisq 2 Profile ID as the 'pre-image'.]]\n<br clear=all>\n\n## = Method 2: Bonding BSQ\n=\n\nYou lock up BSQ tokens for a set period (minimum ~1 year) to gain reputation. This is refundable, but shows commitment for the lock duration. Like burning, regular bonding can represent user activity. Follow the process displayed in the Bisq 2 Reputation section:\n\n# '''Step 1:''' Select the user profile in Bisq 2 for which you want to attach the reputation.\n# '''Step 2:''' Copy the '''Profile ID''' displayed.

You lose these points when you unlock the bond.\n* '''Cumulative:''' You can create multiple bonds; scores add up while active.\n* '''Minimum Lock Time:''' 50,000 Bitcoin blocks (approximately 1 year).\n* '''Confiscation Risk:''' In severe cases (like proven scamming), the Bisq DAO can vote to confiscate (destroy) a user's bond. Confiscating requires high voter turnout (quorum) in the DAO, making it somewhat difficult but possible.\n* '''Oracle Publishing:''' Data about bonded BSQ is automatically published by the oracle.\n\nframe|left|Bonding [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ in Bisq 1 uses your Bisq 2 Profile ID as the 'salt'.]]\n<br clear=all>\n\n## = Method 3: Importing Bisq 1 Account Age\n=\n\nLeverage the history of your fiat accounts from Bisq 1. The older the account, the more trustworthy the user is assumed to be (though this is considered a weaker form of reputation). Follow the process displayed in the Bisq 2 Reputation section:\n\n# '''Step 1:''' Select the user profile in Bisq 2 for which you want to attach the reputation.\n# '''Step 2:''' Copy the '''Profile ID''' displayed.

Scores from multiple accounts are '''not''' added together. Importing from an older account later can replace a previous score from this method.\n* '''Limitation:''' Account age alone is usually '''not enough''' for significant reputation; combine with other methods.\n\nframe|left|Importing account age involves exporting proof from [[Bisq 1.]]\n<br clear=all>\n\n## = Method 4: Importing Bisq 1 Signed Account Age\n=\n\nLeverage the history of fiat accounts that completed the older signing process in Bisq 1. The older the signed account, the more trustworthy the user is assumed to be (though still considered a weaker form of reputation than BSQ burn/bond). Follow the process displayed in the Bisq 2 Reputation section:\n\n# '''Step 1:''' Select the user profile in Bisq 2 for which you want to attach the reputation.\n# '''Step 2:''' Copy the '''Profile ID''' displayed.

Scores are '''not''' cumulative across multiple signed accounts for this method. Importing from an older signed account later can replace a previous score from this method.\n* '''Limitation:''' Signed account age alone may '''not be enough''' for higher reputation tiers; combine with other methods.\n\nframe|left|Importing signed account age involves exporting proof from a signed [[Bisq 1 account.]]\n<br clear=all>\n\n## Reputation Simulation Tool\n\nDeciding how much BSQ to burn or bond can be complex. Bisq 2 provides a simulation tool (visible on the 'SCORE' tab for Burning/Bonding/Import methods) to help sellers estimate the reputation score impact of these actions.\n\nFind this tool within the '''`Reputation`''' section (accessible from the main left-hand menu). It helps visualize the immediate score increase and the potential score after the first year's doubling effect (for BSQ methods) or based on account age.\n\n400px|thumb|left|Simulating the reputation gained from burning [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ.]]\n400px|thumb|right|Simulating the reputation gained from bonding [[Introduction to the DAO|BSQ.]]\n<br clear=all>\n\n## What Happens if a Profile is Banned?\n\nIf a user's profile ID (which contains a public key hash tied to reputation) is banned by moderators for severe or repeated violations of Bisq trade protocols, '''all reputation associated with that specific profile ID is permanently lost''' and becomes unusable. The reputation score will no longer be visible or count towards rankings.

{"title": "Bisq 2 Roles", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Bisq 2 -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Bisq 2 content -->\n\nIn Bisq 2, certain network functions and processes rely on contributors who take responsibility for specific '''bonded roles'''. These roles require locking BSQ as a bond, approved by the DAO, ensuring accountability and security for the network's decentralized infrastructure.\n\nThere are two main types of bonded roles in Bisq 2: System Roles and Delegable Roles.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## System Roles\n\nSystem roles must be performed by the specifically authorized contributor approved by the DAO. For security reasons, these roles cannot be delegated to others.\n\n## = Mediator\n=\n\nMediators in Bisq 2 primarily assist users of the Bisq Easy trade protocol if they encounter issues during a trade. Mediators cannot control user funds and have no direct enforcement powers. However, if a trader is behaving poorly (e.g., attempting scams), mediators can provide information to Moderators, who may then ban users for severe or repeated violations of trade rules.\n\n## = Moderator\n=\n\nModerators help ensure the smooth operation of the Bisq Easy trade protocol in Bisq 2. Their responsibilities include:\n\n* Monitoring offers to remove spam.\n* Handling reports from users or mediators regarding violations of Bisq Easy rules.\n* Investigating potential violations.\n* Banning user profile IDs found to be in violation.\n* Flagging chat messages that violate communication rules.\n\nNote: Due to Bisq 2's support for multiple identities, banning a profile ID may have limited effect, as users can potentially create new profiles.\n\n## = Security Manager\n=\n\nThe Security Manager role is similar to the \"filter operator\" role in Bisq 1. Key functions include:\n\n* Publishing data to block malicious or malfunctioning roles/nodes.\n* Halting trading for specific protocols during critical security incidents.\n* Broadcasting alert messages to the network or specific users.\n\nUsers retain control, as they can choose to deactivate the security manager's filtering influence or ignore alerts if they wish. Alert types include:\n\n* '''INFO:''' Informational popup message.\n* '''WARN:''' Warning popup message.\n* '''HALT_TRADE:''' Custom emergency popup message that disables trade operations for a specified protocol.\n* '''BAN:''' Broadcasts data about a banned role (no text message).\n\n## = Update Manager\n=\n\nThe Update Manager (or Release Manager) broadcasts notifications about new software versions to the network. Notification types include:\n\n* '''PRE_RELEASE:''' Notifies users about new pre-releases (users can opt-in via settings; default is off).\n* '''RELEASE:''' Notifies users about a new official release.\n* '''FORCED_UPDATE:''' Displays a warning popup about a mandatory update to a minimum required version. Trade operations may be halted until the user updates.\n\n## Delegable Roles\n\nDelegable roles perform tasks based on publicly available data and do not need to maintain consensus with other peers. Any user can potentially operate these roles themselves, often configured via JVM arguments.\n\n## = Seed Node\n=\n\nSeed nodes serve as initial contact points for the P2P network. They provide network routing information and filtered Bitcoin blockchain data to new nodes joining the network or light clients. When a Bisq node starts, it contacts several seed nodes to sync network data. At least one hardcoded (root) seed node is necessary for bootstrapping the network.\n\n## = Oracle Node\n=\n\nOracle nodes provide essential data services bridging Bisq 1 information and Bisq 2 functions. There must always be at least one operational oracle node. Services include:\n\n##\nDAO Bridge Service\n##\n\nThis service retrieves DAO data (like bond status and reputation events - BSQ burns/bonds) from a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts it reliably to the Bisq 2 network.\n\n* '''Verification:''' Users can independently verify the integrity of this data by querying a Bisq 1 API node themselves. If discrepancies suggesting intentionally incorrect data are found and reported, a DAO proposal can be made to confiscate the offending oracle operator's bond.\n\n##\nReputation Service\n##\n\nThis service retrieves data relevant to reputation sources like Bisq 1 account age and signed account age via a Bisq 1 API and broadcasts it to the Bisq 2 network.\n\n##\nTime-Stamping Service\n##\n\nThis service provides timestamps used for calculating the age of Bisq 2 user profiles.\n\n## = Explorer Nodes\n=\n\nExplorer nodes provide information about blockchain transaction states, used during the trade process. For example, they might inform users when a Bitcoin payment transaction receives sufficient confirmations.\n\n## = Market Price Node\n=\n\nMarket Price Nodes supply current market price information (e.g., BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) used for setting offer prices relative to the market. Because trades rely on this data, operators of these nodes are required to be bonded.\n\n## Becoming a Bonded Role Holder in Bisq 2\n\nContributors performing bonded roles are typically established Bisq contributors who have been formally approved by the DAO through a voting process. This ensures accountability for these critical network functions.\n\nThe general process is:\n\n1. A potential contributor creates a proposal outlining their intention and qualifications for a specific role on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository].\n2. The proposal is discussed publicly within the community on the GitHub issue.\n3. If there is rough consensus, the contributor then creates a formal \"Bonded Role Proposal\" within the Bisq (v1) application. They must have sufficient BSQ available to cover the required bond amount for the role.\n4. The proposal is submitted to the DAO for stakeholder voting.\n5. If the vote passes, the specified BSQ bond is automatically locked, the contributor's role is registered, and they can begin performing their duties. If rejected, the BSQ is returned.\n\nFor more general information on contributing to Bisq, see the Contributor Checklist. Note that not all contribution tasks require bonding, providing an easier path for new contributors to get involved and build reputation.\n\n## BSQ Bonding for Roles/Nodes\n\nAll System and Delegable roles described here require the contributor to lock a BSQ bond via a successful DAO vote.\n\nThe oracle node plays a key role in verifying that other bonded roles have a valid, active BSQ bond setup. However, the oracle cannot verify itself or the root seed node (due to a \"chicken and egg\" problem). These root nodes are still required to set up their own BSQ bonds independently.\n\nThe bonding process is transparent. Any user can manually verify the status of bonds for roles/nodes through the DAO section of the Bisq 1 application.\n\n## Confiscation of BSQ Bonds\n\nIf a contributor operating a bonded role acts maliciously or harmfully, any community member can propose the confiscation of their BSQ bond.\n\nThe confiscation process is as follows:\n\n1. A user posts a proposal on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues Bisq GitHub Proposals Repository], detailing the harmful behavior and rationale for confiscation.\n2. The proposal is discussed publicly, allowing the bondholder an opportunity to respond.\n3. If rough consensus for confiscation is reached, the user requesting confiscation creates a formal \"Confiscate Bond Proposal\" in the Bisq 1 application.\n4. The proposal is submitted to the DAO for stakeholder voting.\n5. If the vote passes (meeting high thresholds detailed below), the bond is burned (destroyed), the role is unregistered, and the contributor loses their bond and ceases performing the role. If rejected, no action is taken.\n\nConfiscating a bond is a significant penalty reserved for serious offenses. To prevent misuse, the DAO requires exceptionally high support for confiscation proposals:\n* Minimum Quorum: 200,000 BSQ participating in the vote.\n* Minimum Acceptance: 85% approval (compared to >50% for typical proposals).\n\nThis system minimizes the risk of misbehavior in high-trust roles while providing a community-driven mechanism for accountability.

Most exchanges are centralized exchanges running on servers controlled by the exchange. Bisq is decentralized, running only on the desktops of Bisq users.\n\nBisq manages offers to trade using a peer-to-peer network. This is a global network made of users who are also running Bisq on their own computers.\n\nCentralized services are easy to monitor, block, and shut down, while peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, Bitcoin and Bisq are difficult to surveil, censor, shut down or hack.\n\nAll of this means that if you want to use the Bisq network, you must download and run the software on your own machine.\n\n## Download Bisq\n\nThe most convenient way to install Bisq on your machine is from a pre-built install file from the [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Bisq website] or [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest latest GitHub release].\n\nThere's also a community-maintained [https://snapcraft.io/bisq-desktop Snap package] for various Linux distributions.\n\nYou can download the installer for your operating system and install Bisq right away, but we strongly recommend that you verify the integrity of your installer file first.\n\n'''If you have issues, please check the ''Known issues with installation'' section in [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest release notes].'''\n\n## Verify installer file\n\n## = Bisq2 specific instructions\n=\n\nBisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download.\n\nUsually, installation binaries are signed by Alejandro García (key ID: E222AA02, primary release manager). However, since this key has expired — and the expired key was included in previous versions of the Bisq2 app — the in-app verification process would fail when attempting to download version 2.1.2. To prevent this issue, the secondary release manager assumed responsibility for signing that release. The signingkey.asc file specifies the key used for signing the binaries.\n\nHenrikJannsen's signing key can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc here] (full fingerprint: B8A5 D214 ADFA A387 A14C 8BCF 02AA 2BAE 387C 8307).\n\nTo import the key in Linux and MacOS:\n\n<nowiki>curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/387C8307.asc | gpg --import </nowiki>\n\nGPG will return \"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\", this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means)\n\nTo verify the installer against the signature:\n\n<nowiki>gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}</nowiki>\n\nReplace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded.\n\nIn Windows. you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra].\n\nAny software that manages funds, signs transactions, and deals with highly sensitive data is a prime target for malware. Bisq does all three. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you verify the integrity of the installer file you use to install Bisq.\n\nThis verification is something that you should do for the initial Bisq install. After the initial install, you will be prompted to install updates through Bisq's interface. The Bisq software will verify the integrity of updates for you.\n\nBisq installer files are currently built and signed by Alejandro Garcia (alejandrogarcia83).

Each trade protocol presents its own set of advantages and trade-offs including:\n\n* Trade fees\n* Mining fees\n* Security mechanisms\n* Dispute mechanisms\n* Security deposit requirements\n* Privacy benefits / trade-offs\n* Convenience\n\nBisq 2 offers users the flexibility to select the optimal protocol aligning with their requirements and preferences.\n\nAll trade protocols will be able to be accessed from the Bisq 2 application independently. Users will be able to switch between trade protocols for different trades should they wish.\n\nAs of now, Bisq Easy stands as the sole implemented protocol, tailored for novice Bitcoin users and suitable for smaller trade amounts.\n\n## Bisq Easy\n\nBisq Easy will be the first trade protocol for Bisq 2. It will be accessible on the launch of Bisq 2. It is an easy to use chat based trade protocol for buying and selling bitcoin for fiat. The security is based on reputation of the sellers.\n\nSee here for more information about Bisq Easy.\n\n## Future Trade Protocols\n\nBisq is planning on adding more trade protocols available on Bisq 2. Explore the upcoming trade protocols. Keep an eye out for updates if any of the upcoming protocols catch your interest.\n\n## = Bisq Lightning\n=\n\nEscrow based trade protocol on the Lightning network using multi-party computation cryptography.\n\n## = Bisq MuSig\n=\n\nBisq 1 currently uses a 2-of-2 multisig as its main trade protocol. This involves the buyer and seller putting down a security deposit that is locked in a multisig until the trade completes. At some point this protocol will be moved over to Bisq 2.\n\n## = BSQ swaps\n=\n\nThis allows users to swap from BSQ to BTC and vice versa via atomic swaps, instantaneously and secure.\n\n## = Liquid Swaps\n=\n\nTrade any Liquid based assets like USDT and BTC-L with an atomic swap on the Liquid network.\n\n## = Monero Swaps\n=\n\nTrade Bitcoin and Monero using an atomic cross chain swap.\n\n## = Liquid MuSig\n=\n\nThis trade protocol will use the same trade protocol as the 2-of-2 multisig but it will replace Bitcoin (BTC) with Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC). The advantage to this is fees will be lower, and users will get more privacy with their trades. The disadvantage is that users will not be trading native bitcoin so will have to be comfortable holding LBTC and consider the costs of converting BTC to LBTC and back again.\n\n## = Submarine Swaps\n=\n\nThis trade protocol allows users to swap between Bitcoin on Lightning network to on-chain Bitcoin.\n\n## = Stablecoin Swaps\n=\n\nAtomic swaps between Bitcoin and USD stablecoin. Just the same as BSQ swaps, but with a Bitcoin coloured coin built on the same tech.\n\n## = Multisig Options\n=\n\nThis trade protocol would allow the creation of P2P put and call options with the buyer and seller blocking BTC in a multisig on-chain transaction. 2 PSBT would be created sending the BTC to the buyer or seller depending on the result of a binary event. On expiry a blind oracle would trigger the correct transaction to be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.\n\n## = Multisig open contracts\n=\n\nThis trade protocol will allow user defined conditional payments. Any simple contract can be created by locking funds in a multisig 2-of-3 transaction with an arbitrator holding the third key and deciding if the condition was met in case of dispute. This is similar to the old Bisq 1 2-of-3 multisig model, but open to any type of contract than can be easily verified.\n\n## Adding Trade Protocols to Bisq 2\n\nTrade protocols are designed to be modular so more trade protocols can be added in the future.

{"title": "Installing your own Bitcoin node", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nIt is best practice that any Bitcoin user installs his own node, to send and verify his own transactions; moreover, if you use Bisq consistently, you are strongly encouraged to do so, as it will make the bitcoin network connection much more stable, and especially reduce the risk of needing SPV resync on a wallet that contains many transactions. Even when a SPV resync is needed, it will be much painless if done while connected to your own node.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Hardware requirements =\n\nThe most demanding part of a full Bitcoin node is disk space: 1TB is considered the bare minimum (2TB is better for future proofing your node), and a SSD is recommended, as the constant write operations would risk damaging the average mechanical disk. There are pruned nodes that will only keep the very last blocks of the blockchain in order to save on disk space, but as Bisq needs a fully verifying node, we will only be examining this case in the present guide.\n\nThe following are viable hardware options to host the node:\n* refurbished laptop with at least 8GB of RAM\n** pros: comes with display, keyboard, and basic storage (existing storage will need to be replaced or expanded), can run multiple services and act as a full fledged home server, has builtin UPS\n** cons: drains more power and is more expensive than a Raspberry Pi 3, takes up more space on your shelf\n* dedicated Raspberry Pi 3\n** pros: very small, low power, completely silent\n** cons: no builtin display, keyboard nor storage, very low performance, needs more initial maintenance\n* your daily driver machine\n** pros: no need to source additional hardware (except the additional storage if it's not enough), will likely not suffer from the limited additional overhead of a Bitcoin node while you use it normally\n** cons: you either have to leave it always running, to keep updated with blocks as soon as they are mined, or will have to wait a variable amount of time for it to catch up to the current block height each time you turn it on, before you can use Bisq\n\n= Installing the software =\n\nWhen installing the Bitcoin node software, you will be either working on a graphical user interface, or on a system that only operates via command line (most likely the Raspberry).\n\n## Systems with graphical interface\n\nUnless you want to install a leaner daemon setup and follow the command-line steps below, installing directly on a graphical interface is the easier path, as you can download and verify the files as per the instructions on https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ and then install the software as you normally would on your operating system, making sure you point it to the 1TB drive to save the blockchain.\n\n## Systems with command line interface\n\nYou may choose to run a dedicated refurbished laptop on Linux and without a desktop environment, and it would be a wise choice; regarding a Raspberry, while you could install a graphical desktop environment on a Pi 3, it is absolutely not recommended to do so, because it will be a self-contained system that will only cater to the task of running the node software, and any additional load, like keeping the graphical interface in memory, will degrade its performance.\n\nThere is a well known step-by-step guide that will illustrate how to install a full Bitcoin Node on a Raspberry, called the [https://raspibolt.org/ RaspiBolt Guide], plus its amd64/desktop counterpart, directed at laptops/PCs, called [https://minibolt.info MiniBolt]. They both include a section dedicated to installing software for a Lightning Network node, but you will only need to follow the guide for your system up to the configuration of the Bitcoin client.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThere have been multiple reports about the Ronin node package not allowing Bisq to connect (after the first time), and we know no tested solution for this issue, so it is recommended using the steps above to obtain the Bitcoin node software.\n\n## Common steps\n\nNo matter the path you chose above, you will have to wait a considerable amount of time after installing the node.\n\nThe initial block download will have your Bitcoin client fetch from the p2p network, and verify one by one, all the blocks since the genesis, which at the time of writing amounts to 570GB of data, so expect from 2 to 10 days of uninterrupted CPU and network activity, depending on the connection (whether clearnet or Tor) and the performance of the hardware (a faster machine will complete the block verification and writing to disk in less time)\n\n= Setup the node to accept connections from Bisq =\n\nFor the bitcoin connection on Bisq to be effective, you will need to make sure the node's configuration is correct.\nIf you installed the client via command line interface following the guides linked above, you will probably have a working config file already, but in case you installed the GUI client, you will have to manually edit the <code>bitcoin.conf</code> file from within the settings, and make sure it contains the following:\n\n<code>server=1</code><br>\n<code>prune=0</code><br>\n<code>peerbloomfilters=1</code><br>\n\nwhich in turn:\n* enable the block server mode\n* disable the pruning of old blocks\n* allow Bisq to run SPV queries on the node\n\nIf the node is running on a separate machine, but on the same local network, it needs to listen for connections from external clients as well, and the easiest way of doing this is to add the following to the config file:\n\n<code>bind=0.0.0.0</code>\n\nNo need for the above if the node runs on a different network, and you will connect to it via Tor.\n\nAfter any change to the <code>bitcoin.conf</code> file, the bitcoin client needs to be restarted.\n\nIf, on the same remote machine running the node, you installed <code>ufw</code> as the Bolt guides suggest, you have to allow incoming connections on port 8333 (edit the local network base address as needed):\n\n<code>sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/24 to any port 8333 comment 'Bitcoin p2p'</code>\n\n= Setup the connection from Bisq to the node =\n\nThe following will change depending on where the node is located respectively to Bisq.\n\n## Connecting to a node on the same PC\n\nIf the Bitcoin node is installed on the same machine as Bisq, the latter will automatically connect to it without the need to edit anything. Considering how Bisq will only run on amd64 architecture, you can achieve this with either your daily driver, or a dedicated laptop/desktop through direct or remote access (for example via xpra).\n\nMake sure no other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) are running while starting Bisq.\n\n## Connecting to a Bitcoin node on the same local network\n\nAfter setting the config file to accept connections from external machines, as explained above, you will have to setup Bisq to connect to the remote node. This should be achieved by launching Bisq with the following command-line parameters (as an example, the node on the local network is at 10.0.0.21, edit the command to match your situation):\n\n<code>Bisq -btcNodes=10.0.0.21:8333 -useTorForBtc=false</code>\n\nOnce Bisq has started, you should verify under Settings > Network, that these settings are replicated, in particular you should see that the node's IP:port is filled in the address field, and the \"Use Tor for Bitcoin Network\" checkbox is disabled.\n\n## Connecting to a remote node through the Tor Network\n\nIf you installed the node software on a machine that is geographically separate from your local network, and you followed the Bolt guides, it will be already connecting to the internet through Tor, so you can point Bisq to its onion address.\n\nOn the node's machine's shell, run\n\n<code>bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion</code>\n\nto obtain your onion address, copy it to the clipboard and paste it in Bisq under Settings > Network > Use Custom Bitcoin Core nodes\n\nBisq will offer to restart, thus connecting to the custom remote node.\n\n= Verify the connection =\n\nOnce you connect to your own node, Bisq will show <code>Bitcoin network peers: 1</code> in the bottom right corner, and under Settings > Network you will notice the node is the only one listed under \"Bitcoin network\".\n\n= Troubleshooting =\n\nIf you get into a state where Bisq is unable to connect, you can revert to a provided node as follows.\n\nFor MacOS:\n<code>Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true </code>\n\nFor Linux:\n\n<code>/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true </code>\n\nFor Windows:\n\n<code>C:\\Users\\your-username-here\\AppData\\Local\\Bisq\\Bisq.exe -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true </code>\n\nContributor nodes can be seen [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/7c07cdb6ff60ad1186dea33acdfb688668c2aae6/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/btc/nodes/BtcNodes.java#L51-L76 in the Bisq code].\n\nMore info on running from the command line.\n\nMore info on command line options.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Account limits", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nElevated '''account limits''' apply to fiat payment accounts in order to limit damage a malicious user can do while allowing honest users to start trading immediately with no KYC and utmost privacy.\n\nAltcoin accounts can trade 0.5 BTC right away, but all fiat payment account types have limits lower than 0.5 BTC to match their particular risk profiles (see this table for details). Some payment methods with chargeback risk implement a mechanism called ''account signing'' that restricts trading activity until a trader proves their integrity to further secure against foul play.\n\nTo reduce the size of trades entering arbitration Bisq also sets new users trade limits to be 0.1 BTC. This is an additional limit to account limits but users can opt out of this limit at any time.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Which payment accounts are affected\n\nOnly fiat payment methods are affected by elevated account limits. Altcoin accounts are only affected by the new user limits which can be opted out if necessary for allow every altcoin account to trade up to 0.5 BTC right away upon creating a payment account in Bisq.\n\nAll fiat payment methods in all markets limit total trade size depending on the payment method's risk profile (see this table for details).\n\nDespite these limitations, chargebacks can still be possible for certain payment methods. Bisq reduces this risk with a mechanism called '''account signing'''.\n\nAccount signing only applies to payment accounts that meet ''both'' of the following conditions:\n* used in the following markets: USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, or BRL\n* is subject to chargeback risk: SEPA, SEPA Instant, Interac e-Transfer, Zelle, Revolut, Chase QuickPay, Popmoney, MoneyBeam, Uphold, and any kind of bank transfer\n\nThis means that all payment accounts that deal in currencies not listed above do ''not'' require account signing, even if they are subject to chargeback risk.\n\n## Account aging\n\n400px|thumb|See account age in the offer book.\n\nAccount age is no longer used to determine trade size limits for most payment methods. It is still measured, however, and you can see a payment account's age in the offer book before taking an offer, but we caution against using it as a measure of integrity. Older accounts are not ''necessarily'' safer.\n\n'''Practically, this means that all payment methods on Bisq have full selling capability from the moment they are created.''' Selling limits no longer phase in over time.\n\nSome payment methods implement a variation of account aging called account signing whereby limits are increased in stages over a period of 60 days after signing. More about this below.\n\nIf you're interested, details on the <code>AccountAgeWitness</code> object that enables this aging mechanism are [https://docs.bisq.network/payment-account-age-witness.html here].\n\n## Account signing\n\nthumb|right|A graphical overview of account signing.\n\nAccount signing limits ''buying'' limits of risky fiat payment methods to until the trader has bought bitcoin from a seller with a signed payment account, and then gradually phases in full buying limits. Selling limits are unaffected.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is how it works:\n* Payment account is created in Bisq for risky payment method\n** Buying is limited to BTC per trade until account is signed (see how below)\n* 30 days after signing, buying limits are increased to 50% of maximum\n* 60 days after signing, maximum trade size is allowed\n\nLet's see how this works in practice by looking at an example. SEPA has a maximum trade size of 0.0624 BTC, and it requires account signing in order for to enable full trade limits.\n\nFirst let's observe what happens if a new SEPA account is never signed. Notice how buying limits never increase beyond , but selling 0.0624 BTC is allowed from day 0.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Time Since Creating SEPA Payment Account (Never Signed)\n!

There's two ways to get your account signed.\n\n##\nBuying BTC\n##\n\nTo sign your account you have to buy BTC following these requirements:\n* trade amount is greater than or equal to BTC and lesser than or equal to\n* offer must be in a market that requires signing (USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD, BRL)\n* seller's account must have been signed for over 30 days at the time of the signing trade\n\nThrough taking an offer you can make sure that the offer fulfills the requirements to sign your account. Making an offer could not sign your account, because taker could be unable to sign your account (signed since less than 30 days, or unsigned).\n\nThe Bisq interface makes it easy to determine if an offer can help you get signed: simply '''look for buy offers with a check mark badge''':\n\n600px|thumb|left|Top offer won't get you signed. Bottom offer will get you signed.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\nIn the image above, the offer on top does not have a check mark, but the offer on the bottom does. And it's a valid size (i.e., between BTC and ), so taking that offer and successfully completing the trade will result in a signed account.\n\nYou can see your payment account's limits and signing status at <code>Accounts</code> > <code>National Currency Accounts</code>. Pick an account and look toward the bottom:\n\n600px|thumb|left|Where to see your payment account's limits and signing status.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n##\nWith your own signed account\n##\n\nOnce you have 1 signed payment account, any new payment account you create that requires signing will be self-signed as long as it uses the '''exact same name''' as your previously signed account. The payment account can be of a different type (e.g. a signed SEPA account can self-sign a SEPA Instant account), but a payment account created with a name that is even slightly different will not be self-signed.\n\nPayment account types that don't require your full name cannot be self-signed (e.g. Revolut, which only requires an email address) and they cannot self-sign other payment accounts.\n\nSelf-signed accounts are immediately signed, but limits are not immediately lifted. This is because they have an age of 0 days, so 30 days must pass for the limit to be lifted, and another 30 days must pass for full trading ability to take effect (see tables above).\n\n## Backing up and restoring payment accounts\n\nOnce your payment accounts have accrued age and been signed, you won't want to give them up. With proper backups, you won't have to—payment accounts can be restored if you ever have to remove/reinstall Bisq, move to another machine, etc.\n\n## User opt-out limits\n\nTo reduce trades into arbitration for new users unfamiliar with Bisq, new users have a 0.1 BTC limit by default that can be opt-out of at any time.\n\nTo access this limit go to Settings > Preferences\n\nframeless|left|Trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or changed at any time\n\nShown above is the trade limit setting in Bisq that can opted out of or edited higher or lower at any time.\n\nIf you opt of of this limit you will be given a pop up message informing you...\n\nAccount signing limits are still applied to buy BTC with most National Account payment methods to reduce chargeback risk.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "How to be a market maker on Bisq", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nMarkets need liquidity to be useful. A '''market maker''' provides liquidity by creating offers and earns a profit for this very useful service. By publishing offers on Bisq, a market maker makes sure that when other traders come to market to buy or sell, they always have an option to do so immediately.\n\nSome markets on Bisq have few or no offers available. This means that new users see that market empty, they are discouraged and leave without trading. A market maker can bridge that coordination gap, helping kickstart a new market, while at the same time earning some Bitcoin.\n\nHere's a simple way to perform the market maker function:\n\n1. Find a market with few or no offers available.\n\n2. Create an offer to BUY Bitcoin at 3% below market price. (For example see How to create an offer to buy BTC with EUR)\n\n3. Create an offer to SELL Bitcoin at 3% above market price. (For example see How to create an offer to sell BTC with EUR)\n\n4. Stay online and keep Bisq running so that your offers are available.\n\n5. When one of your offers is taken, complete the trade and create a new one to replace it.\n\n6. Tell people about it! Let people from that market know that you are trying to kickstart it.\n\nIn the example above if both your offers are taken you will have sold at 103 and bought at 97, making a profit of 6. You will also be performing a very valuable service for other Bisq users who don't have the time to stay online and just want to be able to take an offer quickly. Offer takers will be happy to pay a small % for the convenience of buying or selling when they want. Some markets are less liquid and you can charge more for your service, others have many more offers and will pay less for the convenience.\n\n*For more short guides see Howto.

We understand the latter are more private because there is no name attached to the payment, but they also come with risks, namely:\n* no payment proof: the seller can claim the code was already spent on receipt, and neither the buyer nor the mediator have any means to ascertain either way\n* illicit origin: code vouchers could be obtained through scams, and the recipient account could get the balance erased as a result, and his Amazon account banned\nFor these reasons, Bisq only allows for eGift cards.\n\n## Regional Availability\n\nAmazon eGift Cards are available in the following regions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Make Payment\n=\n\nAfter your card is ready go, you just have to pay for it! Amazon accepts debit and credit cards, but you cannot pay for an eGift card with another eGift card (or any other Amazon credit balance).\n\nNote: your payment details will NOT be shared with the Seller. The only information they will see is the information you entered to customize the gift card in step 2.\n\nAfter paying, you'll receive an email receipt from Amazon—make sure you keep this email in case of any issues!\n\nThen make sure you mark your payment as sent in Bisq.\n\n## = Step 4.

{"title": "Face-to-face (payment method)", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: Both -->\n<!-- This page is classified as Both content -->\n\nBisq can help users arrange '''face-to-face''' (F2F) trades to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nDone correctly, this may be the only payment method that can be both private ''and'' anonymous. But there are a number of things you should consider when doing a F2F trade on Bisq.\n\nF2F trades are ''technically'' very similar to online trades. In fact, to carry out a F2F trade, you follow the exact same process within the Bisq software as you would for any other trade. The difference is in how the buyer pays the seller: instead of paying through a financial intermediary (like a bank or other money transfer service), the buyer meets the seller in real life and pays with cash.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Setting up a F2F account in Bisq =\n\nWhen setting up a F2F payment account in Bisq, you will be asked to enter the following information:\n\n* Country\n* Currency\n* City (this will be displayed with the offer)\n* Additional information (for example where you would like to complete the trade, '''do NOT place direct contact information here!''')\n\nYou can only select one currency for a single F2F account. If you would like to trade with more than one currency, please create separate accounts for each currency.\n\nDefine any special terms, conditions, or details you would like to be displayed with your offers in the 'Additional Information' field. '''Users can see this field ''before'' taking the offer by clicking the info icon of the offer.'''\n\n= Making a F2F offer =\n\nMake sure to state any special terms or conditions in the 'Additional Information' field of the payment account before making an offer. The person taking the offer will be accepting these terms and conditions by taking the offer. For example you could include that you are looking to complete the trade in a Starbucks within the city center.\n\nPlease note it is against Bisq rules to use the 'Additional Information' field to include advertising offers with a way to contact you prior to the trade (e.g. website, phone, email, or Matrix/Keybase/Telegram user name). Doing this can result in a penalty, should someone take your offer and request for you to be penalized.\n\n= Taking a F2F offer =\n\n'''Make sure to check the offer maker's terms and conditions before taking a F2F offer.''' If you cannot fulfill the terms, do not take the the offer. If you have specific terms you would prefer, consider making your own offer instead.\n\n## Meeting your trading partner\n\nDoing a transaction face-to-face means you’ll be coming within close proximity of a stranger to exchange relatively substantial value.\n\n## = Be safe\n=\n\nPeople do local, in-person commerce all the time, all over the world. Incidents are rare, but they do happen. You should be cognizant of risks and do your part to minimize potential harm.\n\n'''Guard your data.''' When you set up a face-to-face payment account in Bisq, you’ll need to provide contact information so you can arrange a meeting with your trading partner. Make sure this information isn’t traceable back to your property or identity.\n\n'''Meet in a neutral public place.''' Meeting your trading partner in a place with witnesses and security cameras significantly reduces the chance of an incident.\n\n'''Don’t bring more than you need.''' Even in a public place, incidents can still happen, but you can limit the chance even further by limiting valuables on your person that would interest a thief in the first place.\n\n'''Bring backup.''' Consider bringing a friend with you. Also, depending on the laws in your area & your own comfort, consider carrying a concealed tool for self-defense. Even pepper-spray can hobble a criminal just enough to get you out of immediate danger.\n\n## = Validate payment\n=\n\nFace-to-face trades are usually settled with cash. Cash is wonderfully anonymous, but it can be counterfeited. Be sure you know the basics of detecting counterfeit currency. For example, there are several characteristics of US dollar bills one can examine to quickly determine fakes with high accuracy.\n\nYou could look for tools like counterfeit pens to do the work for you, but make sure you do thorough research before picking one. Counterfeit pens, for example, are often not reliable.\n\nIf you’d rather not take the chance of carrying or accepting cash, consider meeting at a bank where you can validate a buyer’s payment on the spot.\n\n## = Ensure you follow Bisq protocol\n=\n\nUltimately, the deal will be completed in Bisq. Buyers must mark payment as sent before sellers can release assets.\n\n'''Buyers''' should bring a laptop with them so they can mark the payment as sent. Otherwise, the buyer will end up paying the seller and have to walk away without the bitcoin they paid for (since the seller won’t be able to acknowledge receipt of payment before the buyer acknowledges they sent payment).\n\n'''Sellers''' should bring a laptop with their Bisq client running no matter what. Once they receive a legitimate payment, they’ll need to mark the payment as received so the assets are released to the buyer. No buyer will want to walk away after paying without proof of a complete deal.\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe lack of verifiable actions makes handling face-to-face disputes much harder.\n\nThis is why we highly recommend that both parties bring laptops and acknowledge their ends of the deal on the spot.\n\nOtherwise, the same dispute process is in place for F2F trades, but be advised that mediators and arbitrators often won’t have a way to settle disputes. In such cases, aggrieved traders can send deposit funds arbitration and make an appeal to the Bisq DAO.\n\nHaving said that, mediators and arbitrators may attempt different tactics to get a handle on the situation.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "SWIFT", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''SWIFT''' (international wire transfer) is a network that allows financial institutions worldwide to send and receive payments internationally in multiple currencies.\n\nSender and receiver typically incur fees and payment times can also be slow (up to 7 days), but payments are secure and almost completely irreversible.\n\nSee this table for up-to-date trade limits and signing requirements.\n\n## Background\n\nAlmost all banks have access to the SWIFT network. Some money transfer services also give users access to the SWIFT Network.\n\nIn order to set up a SWIFT payment account in Bisq, you will need:\n* BIC/SWIFT code\n* IBAN code\n\nAlso ensure that you are aware of:\n* bank fees for sending and receiving SWIFT payments\n* which currencies you can accept\n* what the exchange rate would be in case conversion is necessary\n\n'''Policies vary by bank, and sometimes conversion fees are charged unexpectedly, so make sure you are aware of your bank's policies beforehand.'''\n\n## Setting up the payment account\n\nWhen creating a new payment account for SWIFT, keep the following in mind:\n* Traders using SWIFT on Bisq could be anywhere in the world, so please fill all fields completely and accurately\n* If you are not comfortable sharing your own address, provide the address of your bank\n\nNote: if you transact in a currency that is not native to your bank account (as either maker OR taker), your bank may make you pay currency exchange fees. '''It is your responsibility to cover these fees.''' Please make 100% sure you're aware of what to expect before making or taking an offer.\n\n## Notes on buying BTC\n\nYou can buy BTC with SWIFT on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer to buy BTC on a currency market of your choosing\n# Take an offer to buy BTC on the currency market specified in the offer\n\n## = Send payment in correct currency\n=\n\n'''The bitcoin buyer must send payment in the currency of the market on which the offer was made.''' For example, if you make an offer to buy BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/USD market you should send USD (or ensure your bank converts your local currency into USD). Alternatively, if you take an offer to buy BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/EUR market you must send EUR.\n\nFailure to send payment in the correct currency will result in a penalty for the BTC buyer of either (1) 5% of the trade amount or (2) the amount the receiver is missing in the specified currency as a result of the currency exchange (whichever is greater).\n\n## = Put an appropriate reason for payment\n=\n\nIn general, the reason for payment field should be left blank.\n\nSome users have reported instances in which an intermediary bank converts a payment's currency to the their own currency before converting back to the destination bank's local currency, and taking fees for doing this.\n\nIf you don't want this to happen, consider making the SWIFT sender put \"DO NOT CONVERT\" in the comment field for the wire transfer (not the comment field of the Bisq payment account). This will only work if the recipient is able to handle multi-currency incoming SWIFT payments.\n\n## = Use the correct fee option\n=\n\nSWIFT transfers for Bisq trades should use the SHA (SHAred) fee option. More on this below.\n\n## Notes on selling BTC\n\nYou can sell BTC with SWIFT on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer to sell BTC on a currency market of your choosing\n# Take an offer to sell BTC on the currency market specified in the offer\n\nThe BTC seller should receive the funds in the currency specified in the offer. For example, if you ''make'' an offer to sell BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/USD market, you will receive USD. Alternatively if you ''take'' an offer to sell BTC using SWIFT on the BTC/EUR market, you will receive EUR.\n\nSince SWIFT senders must use the SHA (SHAred) fee option for Bisq trades, sellers may incur fees on their end (see more below). Make sure you are aware of these fees before selling BTC using SWIFT.\n\n## Understanding SWIFT fees\n\nWhen sending a SWIFT transfer the sender has three fee options to choose from:\n\n* BEN (BENeficiary) – payee (recipient of the payment) incurs all payment transaction fees. Typically, the recipient receives the payment minus the transaction fees. The payer (sender of the payment) does not pay any transaction fees.\n* OUR – payer (sender of the payment) incurs all payment transaction fees. Normally you are billed separately for the payment transfer. The payee (recipient of the payment) does not pay any transaction fees. The beneficiary receives the full payment amount.\n* SHA (SHAred) – payer (sender of the payment) pays all fees charged by the sending bank, which are billed separately. The payee (recipient of the payment) pays all fees charged by their receiving bank. The recipient receives the payment minus any applicable fees.\n\n'''Bisq requires buyers to use the SHA (SHAred) fee option for SWIFT transfers.''' If a BTC buyer sends a payment using the BEN (BENeficiary) fee option, they will likely incur a penalty to compensate the BTC seller.\n\nPlease make sure you are aware of your bank's fee schedule for the SHA (SHAred) fee option. Normally it will be $5-25 USD equivalent, but every bank is different.", "category": "general"}

This means that proposals should be as simple, focused, concrete and well-defined as possible. Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your fellow contributors to understand and agree with you.\n* Take full responsibility for your proposal. It is not the maintainers' job, nor anyone else’s, to see your proposal succeed. If people aren’t responding or reacting to your proposal, it’s your job to solicit that feedback more actively.\n* Never assume that anyone other than yourself is going to do the work described in your proposal. If your proposal does place expectations on other contributors, or requires them to change their behavior in any way, be explicit about that.\n* Provide context. Make a strong case for your proposal. Link to prior discussions. Do not make your reader do any more work than they have to to understand your proposal.\n* Format your proposal well. Make it a pleasure to read.\n\nIn general, good proposals take time to research and write. Every minute you spend clearly and logically articulating your proposal is a minute that you save other contributors in understanding it. This diligence on your part will be appreciated and rewarded by others' attention.\n\nA maintainer will quickly review your proposal and will either (a) assign it to you to indicate your ownership and responsibility over it, or (b) close it and label it as <code>was:incorrect</code> if it does not follow the guidelines listed above.\n\n##\nReview\n##\n\nOnce a proposal is submitted, a two-week review period follows.\n\nDuring this period, interested reviewers should read, discuss and ultimately [https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments react] to the proposal as follows:\n* 👍: I agree with the proposal and want to see it enacted.\n* 😕: I am uncertain about the proposal and I need more information.\n* 👎: I disagree with the proposal and do not want to see it enacted.\n\nTry to provide an explanation of your reaction, especially when reacting with a 😕 or 👎. If you don’t, then don’t expect your opinion to have much weight or get addressed.\n\nIf you do not understand or care about a given proposal, ignore it.\n\nUse comments on the proposal issue to discuss, ask questions, and get clarifications. Take lengthy discussions offline to Matrix or elsewhere and then summarize them back on the issue.\n\n##\nEvaluate\n##\n\nThe proposal review process is all about reaching a rough consensus, meaning that there is a broad agreement that the proposal should be enacted, and that any dissenting opinions have been addressed, though not necessarily fully resolved.\n\nAfter the two-week review period is over, a maintainer will evaluate reactions to and discussions about the proposal and will close the issue with a comment explaining that it is approved or rejected based on whether a rough consensus was achieved.\n\nApproved proposals will be labeled with <code>was:approved</code>. Rejected proposals will be labeled with <code>was:rejected</code>.\n\nIf rough consensus has not been achieved, e.g. because discussion is still ongoing, dissenting concerns have not been addressed, or the proposal has turned out to be contentious, the maintainer will indicate that they cannot close the proposal, and that it is up to the submitter to take next steps to move the proposal forward. One option is to submit the proposal to the DAO for voting. If the proposal does not move forward after another two weeks, the maintainer will close and label it <code>was:stalled</code>.\n\nIf there have been no or very few reactions to a proposal after the two-week period, the maintainer will close it and label it as <code>was:ignored</code>.<!-- was:moved-->\n\n##\nEnact\n##\n\nAssuming your proposal was approved, the next step is to actually enact the changes described in that proposal, perhaps by creating a project or simply getting to work.\n\n## = Submit to the DAO (if needed)\n=\n\nSometimes it is necessary to submit proposals to the DAO for voting:\n* DAO parameter changes\n* proposal for bonded roles\n* contentious proposals for which there is strong interest but no clear consensus\n\nFor most general proposals this should not be necessary—general proposals that have clear consensus (or clear lack of consensus) don't need to be voted upon in the DAO. In any case, a DAO submission should only be considered after considerable discussion on GitHub so that voters have context and reason to vote one way or another. Do not submit a DAO proposal before such discussion is established.\n\nSee how to submit a proposal for DAO voting.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Resyncing SPV file", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''Resyncing the SPV file''' (Simplified Payment Verification file, `bisq.spvchain`) can often solve wallet issues within Bisq, such as an incorrect balance showing, missing transactions, or other synchronization problems.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## How to Resync the SPV File\n\nIt is generally best to initiate an SPV file resync using the button within the Bisq application interface. However, if Bisq cannot start properly, you may need to initiate it manually via the file system.\n\n## = From the Bisq Interface\n=\nThis is the recommended method if Bisq is operational.\n# Go to `Settings` > `Network Info`.\n# Click the `RESYNC SPV WALLET` button.\n# Bisq will prompt you to restart the application '''twice'''. Follow the prompts carefully.\n\n600px|thumb|left|Click the 'RESYNC SPV WALLET' button under Settings > Network Info.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n## = From the File System\n=\nUse this method if you cannot access the button within Bisq (e.g., if Bisq fails to start fully).\n# Ensure Bisq is completely '''closed'''.\n# Navigate to your Bisq data directory.\n# Locate and '''delete''' the SPV chain file: `btc_mainnet/wallet/bisq.spvchain`\n# Start Bisq and wait for it to fully load (it will begin the resync process).\n# '''Crucially, close Bisq completely and restart it a second time.''' Bisq will ''not'' prompt you for this second restart when using the manual method, but it is required for the wallet state to initialize correctly after the sync.\n\n## = Fix an Incomplete SPV Resync\n=\nSometimes, especially on older or larger wallets, the SPV resync might hang or get interrupted. If restarting Bisq causes the resync to start over from 0% instead of resuming, you can try this:\n# Ensure Bisq is completely '''closed'''.\n# Navigate to the root folder of your Bisq data directory.\n# Locate and '''delete''' the file named `resyncSpv`. (This file typically only exists if a previous resync was interrupted).\n# '''Restart Bisq'''.\nIt should now attempt to resume the SPV sync from where it previously left off.\n\n## Preventing Frequent or Slow Resyncs: Connect to Your Own Node\n\nIf you find that Bisq frequently requires SPV file resyncs, or if the process consistently takes an extremely long time (especially with an older or high-transaction wallet), the most robust solution is to connect Bisq to your own Bitcoin full node.\n\nWhen connected to your local node, Bisq gets blockchain information directly and reliably, bypassing the need for the SPV synchronization process over the Tor network. This typically results in faster startups and eliminates most common sync-related issues and errors.\n\nFor details on setting up a node and configuring Bisq to use it, please see:\n* Installing your own Bitcoin node\n* Connecting to your own Bitcoin node\n\nWhile running a full node requires more resources (disk space, bandwidth), it offers the best performance, privacy, and stability when using Bisq.\n\nCategory:Use Cases\nCategory:Troubleshooting", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Remote control via web browser using xpra", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nThis guide will have you follow the steps needed to run Bisq on a headless server (could even be a VPS), running Linux (preferably Debian or one of its derivatives), and accessing it using a web browser as if you were in front of the application itself (tested with Firefox, should work with any other major alternative).\n\n## Requirements\n\nAs a rule of thumb, at least 1GB of free RAM is needed, as are 2GB of disk space, on an amd64 architecture (no Raspberry Pi will work, nor old 32bit CPUs, while your average 64bit desktop CPU will run just fine).\n\n## Installing xpra\n\nAs customary, update your system:\n\n<pre>\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt dist-upgrade\n</pre>\n\nFor good measure, add xpra repository\n\n<pre>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list</pre>\n\nAdd the following to bottom of file and then save with '''Ctrl-X''' followed by '''Y'''\n\n<pre>deb https://xpra.org/ bullseye main # edit \"bullseye\" with your version if needed</pre>\n\nAdd xpra GPG key\n\n<pre>wget -q https://xpra.org/gpg.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -</pre>\n\nRefresh repositories\n\n<pre>sudo apt update</pre>\n\nand install\n\n<pre>sudo apt install xpra</pre>\n\nVerify\n\n<pre>xpra --version</pre>\n\n## Installing Bisq from source\n\nWe are going to run Bisq on a headless system (no desktop environment) so installing the deb file will most likely not work. Since we are nerds and like to do things the hard way, we will get the source from github, and build the application ourselves.\n\n## = Create Bisq user\n=\n\nIf you deem it functional, add a user specifically for Bisq\n\n<pre>sudo adduser --gecos \"\" --disabled-password bisq</pre>\n\n\n## = Install git and Java\n=\n\nWe will need the git package to clone Bisq repository, and Java so that Bisq will run\n\n<pre>sudo apt install default-jre default-jdk git</pre>\n\n\n## = Prepare paths for Bisq\n=\n\nMove in a folder where you want the <code>bisq</code> application folder to reside, we will use the <code>bisq</code> user as per the example above, and the custom <code>myapps</code> subfolder of your home (you can place it direcly in home, or wherever you please where the running user has r/w access)\n\n<pre>\nsudo su - bisq\nmkdir -p myapps\ncd myapps\n</pre>\n\n## = Install Bisq\n=\n\nClone the latest version repository and compile the source:\n\n<pre>\ngit clone --branch release/v1.9.10 https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq # change 1.9.10 with current latest version\ncd bisq\n./gradlew build\n</pre>\n\n## Use Bisq remotely\n\nNow the fun begins, as you can run bisq through xpra:\n\n<pre>xpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop</pre>\n\nThen, from the browser on your local machine, go to <code>remoteserverip:9876</code>\n\nIt will load into a GUI, where you should see your Bisq app barely showing in the bottom right corner; if that happens, click on the \"images/windows\" icon in the top floating menu, you should see a list of Bisq windows; press the \"maximize\" icon to show the windows on your screen, and then act accordingly. The same menu action might be needed when popups are shown, as in order to interact with buttons in said popups you sometimes have to manually focus on the popup via the floating menu.\n\nWhen you have to restart Bisq for any reason (for example to refresh tor files, to resync SPV or DAO state) you have to run, on the remote machine:\n\n<pre>\nxpra stop :100 # to stop the running xpra instance\nxpra stop :100 # once more, to REALLY stop the running xpra instance (sometimes it won't work with just one call, especially when restarting Bisq)\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop # to restart Bisq through xpra\n</pre>\n\nThis command will make you wait 20s as a timeout to fully close any existing xpra sessions, after which the application will be launched. You should make the above lines into an executable script, so you can just launch that and have it (re)start Bisq:\n<pre>\ncd /home/bisq\nnano bisqxpra\n# add the above lines in the file and then save with Ctrl-X and press Y\nchmod +x bisqxpra\n./bisqxpra #launch Bisq\n</pre>\n\n## Tips\n\nWhen you want to restart Bisq, you could just execute the above script, but it would terminate Bisq in a potentially breaking way, so it's best to first log into the web interface, close Bisq using the window close button, and only then start the script.\n\nWant to use a custom data folder, just like you maybe used a custom application folder? Add the relevant parameter to the Bisq command:\n\n<pre>\n# make sure you leave the quotes in, to enclose the command to start as a single entity\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876 --html=on --start=\"/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop --appData=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq-data\"\n</pre>\n\nWant to add password authentication, so the Bisq instance isn't accessible to just anyone finding its port on the local network?\n\n<pre>\n# replace password123 with your password, no need for advanced security as anyone able to access your remote server to see this, will have also access to Bisq anyway\nxpra start :100 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:9876,auth=password:value=password123 --html=on --start=\"/home/bisq/myapps/bisq/bisq-desktop --appData=/home/bisq/myapps/bisq-data\"\n</pre>", "category": "general"}

This article covers more notable ones for typical use cases.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Specify a different data directory\n\nThe default data directory Bisq uses is called \"Bisq\". All Bisq data is fully contained in it. The default path of this data directory varies based on your operating system. To change the default path too, see below.\n\nYou can specify a different data directory with <code>--appData=BisqTest</code> (change \"BisqTest\" to whatever you want; \"Bisq\" is the default) and Bisq will create a brand new data directory in the default path with a new wallet, keys, onion address, etc (or use the existing data directory with that name if it's already there).\n\nYou can use this option to run more than one instance of Bisq at once, which can be helpful to send funds from one Bisq instance to another when switching to a new data directory.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## Specify a different data directory path\n\nIf you'd like to change the default path for the data directory altogether (e.g. to store the data directory on another drive), run Bisq with <code>--appDataDir=/external/hard/drive/path</code>.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## Dump delayed payout transactions\n\nAdd the <code>--dumpDelayedPayoutTxs=true</code> option to dump delayed payout transactions in the following files in your data directory, inside the <code>db</code> folder:\n\n# delayed_payout_txs_closed.json\n# delayed_payout_txs_pending.json\n# delayed_payout_txs_failed.json\n\n## Specify a Bitcoin node\n\nSometimes Bisq cannot connect to the node specified in the interface at <code>Settings</code> > <code>Network Info</code>, so starting Bisq with <code>--btcNodes=<node address></code> can help.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## See all Bisq trades\n\nSee all Bisq trades by running the <code>--dumpStatistics=true</code> option. Then check out <code>btc_mainnet/db/trade_statistics.json</code>.\n\nSee below for a suggestion on including this option automatically without having to specify it every time.\n\n## Include command-line options by default\n\nIf there are certain options you'd like to include every time you start Bisq, you can make a script that specifies them for you.\n\nFor example, this script specifies an alternative data directory path on macOS:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appDataDir=/external/hard/drive/path\n\nReplace the Bisq executable path above with the one for your operating system and specify the options you want to include. Then put the script somewhere in your system path so you can easily call it.\n\nOptionally, consider making a dummy directory in the default location to prevent Bisq from accidentally launching in its default mode. To do this, create a directory named \"Bisq\" in the default data directory path for your operating system without any permissions.\n\nFor example, on macOS:\n\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/\n$ mkdir Bisq\n$ chmod 000 Bisq\n\nIn this way, since the system won't have write access in the default location, launching Bisq normally will fail, reminding you to launch Bisq with your script.", "category": "general"}

Often this results in a screen mentioning outdated Tor files and other Tor settings. This could occur for a number of reasons.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Weak internet connection\n\nBisq generally needs a strong, fast connection to work properly. Tethering on mobile connections can work but is known to cause issues.\n\n## 3/4 connection problem\n\nIf Bisq stalls at step 3/4 of the startup sequence for more than 5 minutes it means the initial data download from seednodes has failed, or is taking too long.\nThis can happen on weak or slow internet connections, or if Tor is having issues relaying the large data download to your node.\nProposed mitigation is to clear the Tor cachefiles. (Close Bisq first). All files except <code>hiddenservice</code> can be deleted from <code>btc_mainnet/tor</code> beneath the https://bisq.wiki/Data_directory#Default_locations data directory, they will be re-created as necessary at startup. <code>hiddenservice</code> should be kept as it defines your onion address.\n\nSee https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2547#issuecomment-1016787843\n\nFor a geekier approach, you can also try manually choosing seednodes to connect to\n\n## Windows antivirus software\n\nAntivirus software is known to cause connection issues. Try turning it off to see if it helps Bisq to connect, and if it does, consider switching antivirus software or running Bisq on another operating system on which you don't need to run antivirus.\n\n## Being temporarily banned by the Tor network\n\nTrying to open Bisq too many times in a short timeframe can result in failing to connect to the Tor network. Simple wait 30-60 minutes and then try opening Bisq again.\n\n## Tor censorship\n\nIn certain situations, Bisq may fail to start because your ISP or network provider is actively blocking Tor.\n\nTor is tries to fight such obstacles by providing ''bridges''. Bridges help you connect to the Tor network through a less well-known node. If you know someone who runs a bridge, you can ask to use their bridge, or you can go to https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges to pick a bridge listed by the Tor Project.\n\nIf you're in China, this method using SStap has worked to get around the Great Firewall.\n\n## Tor bridges that don't work\n\nSome network administrators try really hard to block all Tor activity on their network (universities are infamous for this) and will even sometimes block specific types of SSL traffic and handshakes.\n\nIn these scenarios, consider using a VPN and then running Bisq from within the VPN tunnel.\n\n## Altcoin nodes running on the same computer\n\nSome forks of the Bitcoin repository (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc) are known to cause issues with Bisq starting up. Bisq can sometimes recognize altcoin nodes as Bitcoin nodes, causing Bisq to try connecting to them and then failing when it finds no Bitcoin blocks.\n\nTo solve this, switch altcoin nodes off, turn Bisq on and let it load completely. Then, turn the altcoin nodes back on.", "category": "general"}

That means no central wallets or accounts to accumulate funds, and no legal entity or leadership team to control strategy.\n\nFor traders, BSQ offers discounted trading fees. This article covers how to buy BSQ and use it to get a discount on trading fees.\n\n## Acquire BSQ\n\nAlthough BSQ is BSQ technically bitcoin, it’s [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins colored bitcoin] that must be kept in a Bisq wallet, separate from plain bitcoin.\n\nTo help you do this, and to avoid mistakes, Bisq automatically generates a separate BSQ wallet with addresses prefixed with a <code>B</code>—so you can be sure when you’re sending or receiving from a BSQ address.\n\n## = Retrieve your BSQ address\n=\n\nYou can find your BSQ wallet address in <code>DAO</code> > <code>BSQ wallet</code> > <code>Receive</code>.\n\n700px|thumb|left|Get your BSQ address.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n## = Create BSQ payment account\n=\n\nTo trade BSQ on Bisq, you need to set up an altcoin account using your BSQ address.

{"title": "Changing your onion address", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nYou may want to '''generate a new Tor onion address''' for your Bisq instance from time to time, primarily as a privacy-enhancing measure. Bisq automatically uses modern Tor v3 addresses (long, 56-character strings). This guide explains the process for forcing Bisq to create a new one.\n\n'''Note:''' This process changes the onion address your specific Bisq application uses to connect to the Bisq network (peers). It is different from, and does not affect, the Tor addresses of external services Bisq might connect to (like public Bitcoin nodes).\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Important Considerations Before Changing\n\n'''CRITICAL WARNING: Do NOT change your onion address if you have any open trades or open disputes.''' Doing so will make your Bisq instance unreachable by your peers in those specific contexts. You will be unable to complete those trades or disputes, likely resulting in loss of funds (security deposits or trade amounts).\n\n* '''Open offers are OK:''' If you only have open *offers* (not accepted trades), it is safe to proceed. Bisq will automatically update your offers with the new onion address when it restarts.\n* '''Backup Importance:''' This procedure involves deleting a folder. Backing up your '''entire Bisq data directory''' beforehand is strongly recommended. At a minimum, ensure the `hiddenservice` folder within the Tor directory is backed up (see steps below). This backup allows you to revert to your old address if absolutely necessary (e.g., an unexpected issue arises with a recently completed trade requiring dispute).\n* '''Local Reputation Reset:'''\n\n## Checking Your Current Onion Address\n\nYou can verify your current Bisq onion address type:\n1. Go to `Settings` > `Network Info`.\n2. Scroll down to the \"Bisq network\" section.\n3. Your address will be displayed. A modern Tor v3 address is a 56-character string. (Older, now deprecated, v2 addresses were 16 characters).\n\n600px|thumb|left|Check your current onion address under Settings > Network Info.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n## Step 1: Back Up Your `hiddenservice` Directory\n\n'''Before proceeding, ensure Bisq is completely closed.'''\n\nNavigate to your data directory. Find the Tor folder within it, relevant to your operating system and network (e.g., `btc_mainnet/tor/`).\n\n'''Create a safe backup copy''' of the entire `hiddenservice` folder found inside that Tor directory. This folder contains the private keys for your current onion address.\n\n## Step 2: Generate the New Onion Address\n\nWith Bisq still closed and the `hiddenservice` folder safely backed up:\n\n1. '''Delete''' the original `hiddenservice` folder from your Bisq data directory (the one inside `btc_mainnet/tor/` or similar).\n2. '''Restart Bisq.'''\n3. '''Be Patient:''' When Bisq restarts after the `hiddenservice` folder is deleted, it needs to generate new Tor keys and register the new v3 address.\n* This process can take '''up to 10 minutes'''.\n* It is '''resource-intensive''' (uses significant RAM). Close other demanding applications beforehand.\n* Bisq '''may appear unresponsive''' during this time. Do not force quit; let it run.\n4. Once the process completes, Bisq will start normally, and you will have a new Tor v3 onion address. You can verify it under `Settings > Network Info`.\n\nRemember to create new backups that include your new `hiddenservice` folder.", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Trading rules", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nBoth Bisq traders must follow these '''trading rules''' to ensure smooth and successful trades.\n\nTo trade on Bisq, you assume one of two roles, no matter what national currency or cryptocurrency you’re trading: you either ''buy bitcoin'' or ''sell bitcoin''.\n\nThe rules below are '''default''' rules for every transaction. Offer makers sometimes specify their own additional terms for handling payments. For example, a seller using cash deposits might require a picture of a receipt torn in half with \"NO REFUND\" written on it. Face-to-face traders often specify terms about where and how to meet.\n\nMake sure you’re okay with an offer-maker’s terms '''before''' you accept an offer!\n\nTrade rules also help with the following:\n\n* Promoting good behavior from traders\n* Penalizing bad behavior from traders\n* Promoting good payment accounts of traders\n* Penalizing bad payment accounts of traders\n* Put the 'wrong doer' in a worse position and the person 'not at fault' in a better position\n\n= Common rules =\n\n## = No requirement to reply in trader chat\n=\n\nWhile using the available trade chat can be helpful to resolve issues directly among traders without the overhead of mediation, and being communicative is a good way to ease the process for new traders, there is no obligation to reply to a peer's messages.\n\n## = Do not communicate with your peer away from Bisq\n=\n\nUsing email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is strongly discouraged. The trader chat feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader’s chat messages indicate they broke a rule). This includes advertising offers to sell BTC with a way to contact you, for example a website, Telegram user name, or email.\n\nIn any case, it is forbidden to contact the peer using contacts obtained from their payment details, without their prior consent, or missing a compelling reason to do so.\n\n## = Be responsive during a dispute\n=\n\nTraders are expected to reply within 48hrs to either mediators or arbitrators, and could lose the dispute based on unresponsiveness.\n\nMediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.\n\n## = Do not change payment details once trade is in progress\n=\n\nOnce the deposit transaction is published, the trade is in progress, and its terms cannot be changed. Traders agreed to use the payment details specified in the trade contract.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected circumstance (e.g. hitting a bank-imposed transfer limit, or a payment institution interfering with the transaction), traders can propose alternatives through trader chat or mediation, but the peer is not required to comply. It is each trader's responsibility to ensure that the payment account in their offer will work before an offer is taken.\n\n= Rules for bitcoin sellers =\n\nWhether making or taking an offer, bitcoin sellers put all the bitcoin they’re selling in the multisig escrow, so there’s less for them to do and fewer rules they need to follow.\n\n## = Click <code>Confirm payment</code> after receiving payment\n=\n\nSellers have until the end of the maximum trade period to do so.\n\nAccount signing, introduced in Bisq v1.2, enables a seller with a signed payment account to sign a buyer’s payment account when they successfully receive a payment. For such trades, it is recommended that the seller take as long as possible (i.e., wait until close to the end of the trade period) to confirm receipt of payment to reduce the chance of a chargeback.\n\n## = Do not confirm payments with mismatching details\n=\n\nPayer name, account numbers, payment method, institution, and other details of a payment should match the details in the trade contract. If there are any concerns that buyer's payment details do not match (e.g. wrong name, account number etc) payment should not be accepted.'''\n\n= Rules for bitcoin buyers =\n\n## = Make payment reasonably early within trade period\n=\n\nBuyer should complete at a time such that the seller has enough time to acknowledge receipt of the payment before the trade period is over. Waiting until the very end of the trade period to make a payment is not advised, as then the seller cannot reasonably act in time to acknowledge receipt (also, it’s annoying). The lengths of trade periods vary based on payment method.\n\nThis is especially important for buyers with unsigned payment accounts trading with sellers with signed payment accounts. A seller will not want to confirm receipt of a payment made at the last minute from an untrusted account, so if you’re a buyer looking to get your payment account signed, you should make the payment ''as soon as possible''.\n\nSome payment methods include an option to cancel a payment after you have sent it eg Revolut and Interac e-Transfer. If you cancel payment without agreement with the seller or mediator you might end up being penalized for cancelling the trade.\n\n## = Click Payment started after sending payment\n=\n\nSeller cannot mark payment as received until buyer confirms that they have sent it.\n\nDon’t forget to do this!\n\n## = Leave the \"reason for payment\" field empty\n=\n\nSome payments offer a way to specify a reason for payment (some payment methods call it \"Message\" or \"Information for recipient\" or similar). '''Leave this field BLANK.''' Do not put the trade ID, any mentions of \"Bisq\" or \"Bitcoin\" or \"crypto\", or any other text whatsoever.\n\nIf you are required to fill in a reason, use your account name eg \"Joe Bloggs\" alternatively enter something non-descriptive like a dash \"-\". If you would prefer to use other text please agree this with your peer in trader chat. Please remember your peer is not obligated to agree anything and may not want to agree to anything other than leaving the description blank, your name or a dash.\n\nViolating this rule will likely result in a trade penalty.\n\nMany banks don’t like anything related to Bitcoin, and may take draconian measures if they sense such a transaction.\n\nMany users trade from personal accounts and may object to using anything that looks like it could be a commercial transaction.\n\n## = Pay any transaction fees\n=\n\nAny fees incurred to make the payment via the agreed payment method (e.g., bank fees for bank transfer, money-order fees for money orders, etc) are the buyer’s responsibility to pay.\n\nThe seller should receive the exact amount of the trade. The only exception to this rule is if the receiving institution imposes a fee on incoming payments—these fees are borne by the seller.\n\n= What happens when things go wrong? =\n\nSometimes trades do not go to plan for whatever reason.\n\nIt is prudent for all traders to know when entering into the trade what will happen when things go wrong. Traders would be wise to make themselves aware of the dispute resolution process to ensure there are no surprises.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Create a new wallet for your data directory", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nWhen you just need a fresh new wallet, but wish to keep everything else (accounts, signing status, onion address, trade history, notifications app association, and other custom settings), it is easier and faster to only generate a new wallet for Bisq, rather than switching to a new data directory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Why creating a new wallet? =\n\nBeing a project built in Java, Bisq uses [https://bitcoinj.org/ bitcoinj], which is a Java library to manage a bitcoin wallet, among other things. This comes with some known limitations, among which is the heavy performance hit when the wallet is old, and contains many transactions, this being especially aggravating when a user needs to do a SPV resync, as it will take a significant amount of time during which the PC will suffer from high load. With old-time and very active traders, who have many past transactions built up in their wallet, this is even more at risk of happening, and causes a forced interruption in trading, as SPV resync must be completed before the application can resume its operativity.\n\nRecreating a completely new Bisq wallet will eliminate the issue, at least for the near future (running your personal Bitcoin node also helps a lot with stability), at the same time preserving all the accrued reputation of your payment accounts, your full trading history, and your existing onion address, by which your previous trading peers will be able to recognize you.\n\n= Preparations =\n\nMake sure the following checklist is observed:\n* No existing open offers (delete them -this will make you lose the fees- or wait until they are taken, and their respective trades are completed).\n* No existing open trades (wait until they are completed).\n* No existing disputes (wait until their resolution).\n* Consistent wallet state (go to Funds > Send Funds, and for each btc address containing funds, verify its balance actually exists by searching the address on [https://mempool.space mempool.space], otherwise do a SPV resync and repeat).\n\n= Caveats =\n\nThe provided instructions are safe as long as you don't make mistakes, which could amount to:\n\n* Deleting a folder instead of renaming it.\n* Using a wrong address to send funds to.\nThe above mistakes can easily lead to loss of funds, which we obviously are not liable for.\n\n= Instructions =\n\nIf the above requirements are met, and you understood the caveats, assuming you have BTC (and probably BSQ as well) in your old wallet, you can follow the procedure outlined below:\n\n# Close Bisq.\n# Rename the data directory from <code>Bisq</code> to <code>Bisq.old</code>. Copy this file to an external device, it will be used as a backup in case of data loss.\n# Start Bisq.\n# A new Bisq instance called Bisq will be created (including a new wallet, which is the one we will soon be using to replace the old one).\n# Go to ''Account'' > ''Wallet seed'' and write down the seed of the new wallet. Set the password for the wallet at ''Account'' > ''Wallet password''.\n# Go to ''Funds'' > ''Receive Funds'' and copy the first btc receive address, pasting it into a separate text file for later use.\n# Go to ''DAO'' > ''BSQ Wallet'' > ''Receive'' and copy the BSQ receive address of the new wallet, pasting it into your notes.\n# Close Bisq.\n# Rename the newly created data directory, from <code>Bisq</code> to <code>Bisq.new</code>, and rename the previous directory from <code>Bisq.old</code> to <code>Bisq</code>.\n# Start Bisq\n# You will be back into your old Bisq instance\n# Go to ''DAO'' > ''BSQ Wallet'' > ''Send'' and send all your BSQ balance to the BSQ receive address of the new wallet (this needs to be done first! if you moved out all of your BTC now, there would be none left to pay for the mining fees to move the BSQ!)\n# Go to ''Funds'' > ''Send Funds'' and move all your BTC balance to the BTC receive address of the new wallet.\n# Close Bisq\n# Within the data directory, navigate to the contents of <code>btc_mainnet</code> and rename the <code>wallet</code> folder to <code>wallet.old</code>.\n# Copy the <code>wallet</code> folder from the same location in <code>Bisq.new</code>, into the <code>btc_mainnet</code> folder of the \"old\" data directory, so that now there will be <code>wallet</code> and <code>wallet.old</code> folders under <code>btc_mainnet</code>.\n# Start Bisq, wait until wallet is synchronized with the blockchain, and verify that all your funds were correctly moved, checking the contents of ''Funds'' > ''Send Funds'', and ''DAO'' > ''BSQ Wallet''.\n# You can now operate normally with Bisq. The brand new wallet will be used instead of the old one.\n\n= Create a new wallet when the old one is empty =\n\nIf you wish to switch to a brand new wallet, and there are no funds (anymore) in the previous one, the procedure is much simpler:\n# Close Bisq.\n# Navigate to your data directory and into the <code>btc_mainnet</code> folder.\n# Rename the <code>wallet</code> folder to <code>wallet.old</code>.\n# Start Bisq, notice a new wallet was created, write down the new seed and set the password.\n\n= Disaster recovery =\n\nIn case you made some mistakes along the way and things don't work as they should, and provided you never deleted anything, but rather renamed the folders as suggested above, you can go back to the starting point by simply making sure, after closing Bisq, that the data directory gets back to its original state, that is, <code>Bisq.old</code> is renamed to <code>Bisq</code>, and, if you got to that point, <code>wallet.old</code> to <code>wallet</code>.\n\nHaving a copy of <code>wallet.old</code> at an external device (like a usb memory) is also recommended, in case of the unlikely event of permanent data loss.\n\n= Cleanup =\n\nOnly after you are absolutely sure everything is in order, and if you need to free up as much disk space as possible, you can delete the <code>Bisq.new</code> and <code>wallet.old</code> folders.", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Resyncing SPV file", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''Resyncing the SPV file''' (Simplified Payment Verification file, `bisq.spvchain`) can often solve wallet issues within Bisq, such as an incorrect balance showing, missing transactions, or other synchronization problems.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## How to Resync the SPV File\n\nIt is generally best to initiate an SPV file resync using the button within the Bisq application interface.

Bisq will ''not'' prompt you for this second restart when using the manual method, but it is required for the wallet state to initialize correctly after the sync.\n\n## = Fix an Incomplete SPV Resync\n=\nSometimes, especially on older or larger wallets, the SPV resync might hang or get interrupted. If restarting Bisq causes the resync to start over from 0% instead of resuming, you can try this:\n# Ensure Bisq is completely '''closed'''.\n# Navigate to the root folder of your Bisq data directory.\n# Locate and '''delete''' the file named `resyncSpv`. (This file typically only exists if a previous resync was interrupted).\n# '''Restart Bisq'''.\nIt should now attempt to resume the SPV sync from where it previously left off.\n\n## Preventing Frequent or Slow Resyncs: Connect to Your Own Node\n\nIf you find that Bisq frequently requires SPV file resyncs, or if the process consistently takes an extremely long time (especially with an older or high-transaction wallet), the most robust solution is to connect Bisq to your own Bitcoin full node.\n\nWhen connected to your local node, Bisq gets blockchain information directly and reliably, bypassing the need for the SPV synchronization process over the Tor network. This typically results in faster startups and eliminates most common sync-related issues and errors.\n\nFor details on setting up a node and configuring Bisq to use it, please see:\n* Installing your own Bitcoin node\n* Connecting to your own Bitcoin node\n\nWhile running a full node requires more resources (disk space, bandwidth), it offers the best performance, privacy, and stability when using Bisq.\n\nCategory:Use Cases\nCategory:Troubleshooting", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Switching to a new data directory", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''Switching to a new data directory''' can help you start with Bisq anew: fresh wallet, new onion address, new keys, etc. It's a sort of \"factory reset\" that makes it like you're starting Bisq for the first time.\n\nUpon creating a new data directory, you can restore various parts of a previous data directory (e.g., aged and signed payment accounts).\n\nIf you instead wish to only obtain a new wallet, while preserving every other element of your data directory, you can create a fresh wallet in the same data directory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Why switch to a new data directory? =\n\nIt's a good idea to switch to a new data directory every so often.\n* '''Performance''' - Bisq uses bitcoinj, an SPV library that is not built for high performance, so wallets get increasingly large with every transaction. Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).\n* '''Stability''' - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.\n* '''Privacy''' - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see local reputation).\n\nIn addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around unusual wallet corruption issues.\n\n= Make sure you're ready to switch =\n\n## = Ensure your existing data directory is backed up\n=\n\nSee how here. Be sure to also do a payment account export to make importing payment accounts easier.\n\n## = Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes\n=\n\nThis is paramount because '''you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.''' If you don't want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.\n\n= Send funds =\n\nYou will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow.\n\nThere are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.\n\n# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from <code>Funds</code> > <code>Send Funds</code>, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in <code>Settings</code> > <code>Preferences</code>).\n#* Variation: Use the Emergency Wallet Tool (<code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>E</code>) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn't working.\n# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it. This method is '''not''' recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See derivation path and other details here.\n# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).\n## Start Bisq.\n## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the <code>appName</code> option. See how to run Bisq from the command line here.\n##* macOS example command: <code>/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new</code>\n##* Name of the new directory doesn't matter. <code>Bisq-new</code> was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it's just a temporary placeholder. You'll be changing it back to \"Bisq\" anyway.\n## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.\n## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.\n\n= Create new data directory =\n\nIf you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:\n# Close Bisq.\n# Delete (or rename) the <code>Bisq</code> data directory (see default locations for your operating system here).\n# Start Bisq again.

{"title": "ACH Transfer", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''ACH Transfer''', or Automated Clearing House Trasnfer, is a payment method introduced in Bisq v1.8.0. It is primarily used for domestic, low-value payments between participating financial institutions. ACH transfers are one of the two main bank transfer payment methods in the United States, the other being domestic Wire transfers.\n\n## What countries offer ACH Transfer?\n\nACH is only available in the United States.\n\n## What currencies are available for ACH Transfer?\n\nACH only supports transfers of USD.\n\n## What is the maximum trading duration for ACH Transfer?\n\nThe maximum trade time is 5 days, but most are completed within 2 business days. Financial institutions send ACH transfers in batches. Depending on when the transfer is initiated, it will be received the next business day, by the end of the current day, or in real time.\n\n## What is the maximum BTC limit for ACH Transfer?\n\n.\n\n## Is ACH Transfer a payment method that can be signed?\n\nNo, ACH accounts do not require signing.\n\n## How do I set up a ACH Transfer account?\n\nPlease note that not all banks offer ACH transfers to third parties. It's crucial to verify if your bank supports this service. Most banks allow ACH transfers to accounts you own at other institutions. However, they may ask you to confirm two micro-deposits they initiate. This process is not the same as a third-party transfer and Bisq sellers usually won't confirm these micro-deposits. Confirming micro-deposits enables your bank to send and receive money from that account, but this isn't a third-party transfer. If your bank fully supports third-party ACH transfers, they won't ask for micro-deposit verification. ACH transfers are typically provided at a low cost, so be sure to check with your bank about any fees.\n\n## How do I add ACH Transfer as a payment method in Bisq?\n\nTo add your ACH account to Bisq:\n\n# Head to the top menu and select ''Account''.\n# Then, choose ''National Currency Accounts''.\n# Click on ''Add new account''.\n# Select ''ACH''.\n# Fill in the necessary details.\n# If you'd like, choose to use a custom account name. This can help you manage multiple payment methods in Bisq. It will be visible only to you, like \"ACH - Chase Bank - USD - Jane Doe\".\n# Once done, click save new account.\n# If you have more than one ACH account you wish to add to Bisq you can create different accounts for each.\n\nEnsure all the details are accurate when you add them. Sellers can only confirm payment if the name associated with the incoming ACH transfer matches the account name listed in Bisq.\n\n## How do I buy BTC with my ACH Transfer account?\n\nYou can buy BTC with ACH on Bisq in 2 ways:\n\n# Make an offer to buy BTC on the USD market.\n# Take an offer to buy BTC on the USD market.\n\nWhen the offer is confirmed, Bisq will provide you with the BTC seller's ACH details for you to complete the payment. You should send the payment immediately and confirm you have done so in Bisq by clicking 'payment started'.\n\nIf you have the option to include a payment reference, please leave it blank. If your bank requires one, please just use your name that matches your bank account.\n\nOnce the BTC seller receives your payment, they will confirm in Bisq, and your security deposit and your purchased trade amount will be available in your wallet.\n\n## How do I sell BTC with my ACH Transfer account?\n\nYou can sell BTC with ACH on Bisq in 2 waysː\n\n# Make an offer on the USD market to sell your BTC.\n# Take an existing offer on the USD market to sell your BTC.\n\nAfter the offer is confirmed, Bisq will provide the BTC Buyer with your ACH details. The Buyer should send the payment at their earliest convenience and confirm it in Bisq by clicking 'Payment Started'.\n\n## Are there any limits for me to be aware of when sending an ACH transfer\n\nYour bank may impose limits on the amounts you can send or receive. You should check if your bank has any such limits.\n\n## Are there any fees for me to be aware of when sending an ACH transfer?\n\n\nFees charged by your bank for sending an ACH transfer can vary and it's best to check with them. Fees can also be different depending on the speed of the transfer as some banks offer expedited processing.\n\nGenerally, banks will not charge for receiving ACH transfers, but again, it's best to check with your bank since some do charge.\n\n## How does dispute resolution work with ACH transfers?\n\nIf a dispute occurs, the mediator may ask the buyer to send them information showing that they made the payment of the correct amount to the BTC Seller within the correct time frame. The mediator may also ask the seller to send them information to prove their account details are correct, or in the case of the BTC Buyer making a payment late, or of the wrong amount.\n\nFor more information see dispute resolution.", "category": "general"}

This article covers some things you should know when trading it.\n\n= Instant payment accounts =\n\nBy default, all altcoins trades on Bisq have trade periods of 1 day. But you can set up an Altcoins Instant account on Bisq for 1-hour trade periods.\n\n= Proving payments =\n\nSome details of XMR transactions are not publicly available on the blockchain. In order for a mediator or arbitrator to handle disputes, the XMR seller must make sure they send XMR using a wallet that provides the following 3 items to prove the payment was made:\n# transaction key (Tx Key, Tx Secret Key, or Tx Private Key)\n# transaction ID (Tx ID or Tx Hash)\n# recipient's address\n\nThis information can be found in the following wallets: official Monero GUI and CLI wallets, MyMonero, Exodus (desktop), Cake Wallet, and Monerujo (mobile):\n\n* Monero GUI: on the Transactions tab.\n* Monero CLI: use the command <code>get_tx_key <TXID></code>. The flag <code>store-tx-info</code> must be enabled (it's enabled by default in new versions).\n* Other wallets: go to transaction history and look for transaction key (sometimes called \"tx key\" or \"secret key\") and destination address in a sent transaction. For Cake Wallet, the \"Save recipient address\" option must be enabled in settings.\n\nIf you are using another wallet not mentioned above, be sure you can still access the 3 items mentioned above.\n\nSince transaction keys and destination addresses are stored in Monero wallet software and not available anywhere else, be careful not to delete or restore your Monero wallet before a Bisq trade is complete.\n\n'''Failure to provide the required transaction data will result in losing disputes.'''\n\n= Verifying payments =\n\nTo verify that a certain sum of Monero was sent to a specific address:\n* Monero GUI: change wallet to Advanced mode and go to <code>Advanced</code> > <code>Prove/check</code> > <code>Check Transaction</code>\n* Monero CLI: use the command <code>check_tx_key <TXID> <TXKEY ADDRESS></code>\n\n* [https://monero.com/explorer Monero.com explorer] - working checked 17.10.23\n* [https://p2pool.io/explorer/ P2pool explorer] - working checked 17.10.23\n* [https://xmrchain.net/ XMR Chain] - working checked 17.10.23\n* [https://www.exploremonero.com/receipt Explore Monero website] - working checked 26.11.23\n* [https://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html XMR Check Transaction tool] - not working checked 17.10.23\n\nIf you still have questions, see [https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html this guide on the Monero home page] or ask a question on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/monerosupport/ Monero support subreddit].\n\n= Auto-confirming trades =\n\nAuto-confirming trades verify receipt of XMR payment automatically. Typically, XMR buyers must check their wallet and manually mark a payment as received in Bisq. Auto-confirming trades do this automatically, making trades quicker and more efficient for both traders.\n\nThis feature is currently available for XMR trades where:\n* the XMR seller provides a valid transaction key or viewkey\n* the XMR buyer has auto-confirming trades turned on in Bisq settings\n\nAuto confirming works very well most of the time. However on some occasions users might be manually required to confirm payment, for example then the incorrect data is supplied by the BTC buyer.\n\nBy default auto-confirming trades is turned on in the Bisq app, if you wist to turn if off it can be done in Settings > Preferences:\n\nframe|left|XMR auto confirm\n\n## How it works\n\n## = XMR Seller\n=\n\nThe XMR seller will get a pop-up upon clicking <code>Payment Sent</code> asking for the XMR tx ID and XMR tx key.\n\n600px|thumb|left|The XMR seller can choose to enter this information, or not.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\nThe trader can choose to enter this information, or not.

In this particular instance, the XMR seller didn't specify the information needed for auto-confirm to work.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\nExplorer nodes are queried every 90 seconds for 12 hours. If 12 hours pass without success, auto-confirm fails for the trade. If Bisq receives just 1 failure of any kind (related to transaction, network issues, etc), auto-confirm is considered failed. '''This does not mean the XMR transaction was invalid.''' It just means the user should check the transaction manually.\n\nThe user can mark the transaction as received any time by clicking <code>Confirm Payment Receipt</code> themselves, and auto-confirm will stop running for that trade and the trade will be completed normally.\n\n## Settings\n\nOn the Bisq settings screen, you can set:\n* Maximum amount of BTC that can be confirmed per trade (default: 1 BTC)\n* Monero Explorer node address (default: nodes run by Bisq contributors; see below for how to run your own)\n* Number of required confirmations (default: 5)\n\nPlease note that changes to these settings are applied immediately only for trades for which payment hasn't been started yet. Restart Bisq for updated settings to apply to all trades.\n\n'''Changing the required number of confirmations is an exception: it takes effect immediately for all trades.'''\n\nDisabling the auto-confirm feature altogether also takes effect immediately. But re-enabling the feature will only take effect on trades for which payment hasn't been started yet; restart Bisq for the auto-update feature to apply to all trades.\n\n600px|thumb|left\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n## Monero Explorer nodes\n\nBy default, the Bisq auto-confirm feature relies on [https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/107 a few Monero Explorers operated by Bisq contributors], but we highly recommend you to run your own Monero Explorer node at home.

{"title": "Trading L-BTC", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''L-BTC''', or Liquid Bitcoin, is a Confidential Asset, fully verifiable, and 1:1 backed BTC token created by [https://liquid.net/ Liquid], a federated sidechain pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain. Liquid is implemented by Elements, an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform based on the Bitcoin codebase created by Blockstream.\n\nA sidechain is a mechanism that allows tokens from one blockchain to be used securely in an independent blockchain which runs in parallel and uses a different set of rules, performance requirements, and security mechanisms. On a sidechain, one can move tokens back to the original chain through a two-way peg. Sidechains enable new functionality that may have security trade-offs or as a way to test new features that may not be ready to use on the parent blockchain.\n\nThese are some new functionalities that Liquid enables:\n\n* Confidential Transactions: hides the amount from the information displayed at the blockchain -- the most important feature for most Bisq users\n* Issued Assets: allows issuing tokenized fiat, securities, altcoins or digital collectibles\n* Federated consensus mechanism: allows 2- or 3-minute settlement times in normal conditions\n* In development: Schnorr signatures, which will improve network privacy and capacity\n\nAll addresses in Liquid are blinded by default using Confidential Transactions. The asset and amount of a transaction is hidden to those watching the Liquid sidechain. Bisq users can mix their coins with all of Liquid federation BTC holdings just trading both assets.\n\n## Selling L-BTC\n\nSelling L-BTC is like selling any other altcoin. It just requires an L-BTC payment account in Bisq.\n\n## Buying L-BTC\n\nThe trader ''receiving'' L-BTC (L-BTC buyer) must be able to generate proof of payment in case of a dispute. Otherwise, Confidential Transactions make it impossible for a third party to verify if a payment was made—so L-BTC buyers must be able to generate a transaction's blinding key for mediators or arbitrators in case of disputes.\n\n## = Generate blinding key\n=\n\n'''Green Wallet and other custodial wallets can't generate blinding keys, so you must use Elements Core to receive L-BTC for Bisq trades.'''\n\nInstall the [https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements Elements Core full node software] (note that this does ''not'' require running a Bitcoin Core full node) and follow these steps:\n# Get the receiving L-BTC address\n# Open the GUI console window of your Elements Core full node, or use <code>elements-cli</code>\n# Type the command <code>dumpblindingkey <address></code>, where <code><address></code> is the receiving L-BTC address from step 1\n\nThe Elements console will return the [https://elementsproject.org/elements-code-tutorial/confidential-transactions#blindingkey blinding key] in hex. This blinding key is what dispute agents will ask for in case an L-BTC trade ends up in dispute.\n\n## FAQ\n\n'''How is the price of L-BTC determined?'''\n\nL-BTC is a 1:1 BTC pegged token to Bitcoin, so high volatility is not expected. Buyers and sellers make their fixed price orders close to parity. There's no price feed with market % based prices for this market.\n\n'''Why not just use the peg-in and peg-out mechanism to exchange L-BTC and BTC?'''\n\nA peg-in transaction (BTC to L-BTC) requires 102 confirmations on the Bitcoin network (17 hours) before funds can be claimed on the Liquid Network. Peg-out requires approval from two-thirds 2/3 Liquid functionaries approval and it takes about 17-35 minutes to complete. Bisq offers private, easy and secure L-BTC on and off-ramp.\n\n## Guidance for dispute agents\n\nIn order to verify L-BTC trades, install the Elements Core software on your computer from https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/releases, and then:\n* Set <code>txindex=1</code> in <code>elements.conf</code> (neither L-BTC sender nor receiver need this setting)\n* Wait until Elements fully syncs to the Liquid blockchain\n\n## = Verifying a transaction\n=\n\nObtain information from trading peers:\n# Obtain the TXID for the L-BTC transaction (either trading peer can provide this information)\n# Obtain the Blinding Key for the receiving L-BTC address from the L-BTC buyer/receiver\n# Verify that both the L-BTC address and TXID are visible on https://blockstream.info/liquid\n\nVerify the transaction:\n# Open the GUI console window of your Elements Core full node, or use <code>elements-cli</code>\n# Type <code>importaddress <address></code>, where <code><address></code> is the L-BTC address of the L-BTC buyer/receiver.

This article contains the requirements for this to work correctly.\n\nYou can also specify the addresses of particular Bitcoin nodes in <code>Settings</code> > <code>Network Info</code>.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= General node settings =\n\nThe bitcoin.conf file needs to contain the following settings (either by adding them or editing the existing ones):\n\n<code>server=1</code><br>\n<code>prune=0</code><br>\n<code>peerbloomfilters=1</code><br>\n\nwhich in turn:\n* enable the block server mode\n* disable the pruning of old blocks\n* allow Bisq to run its SPV wallet\n\nMultiple reports have been received, where any declination of the Ronin node just won't work, or will work once, only to stop working after the next reboot, requiring a restore to network provided nodes. We are not able to suggest a workaround, except involving Ronin support.\n\n= Connecting to a local Bitcoin node =\n\nIf you're running a Bitcoin full node on the same machine as Bisq, Bisq should connect to your node on startup—it will look for Bitcoin Core or <code>bitcoind</code> running on <code>localhost</code> on port 8333.\n\nJust make sure to not be running any other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) while starting Bisq.\n\n= Connecting to another Bitcoin node =\n\nBy default, Bisq maximizes your privacy by connecting to nodes run by trusted Bisq contributors.\n\nIf you'd like to connect to another node, you can specify its address in <code>Settings</code> > <code>Network Info</code>. Bisq will validate the address and connect to the specified node the next time it starts.\n\nBisq supports connecting to Bitcoin nodes with Tor v3 addresses: this is the easiest path to take, since you only have to fill in your node's onion address in settings.<br>\nIf your node is on your local network, connecting directly to it rather than using Tor would reduce latency by a sensible degree.

Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).\n* '''Stability''' - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.\n* '''Privacy''' - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see local reputation).\n\nIn addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around unusual wallet corruption issues.\n\n= Make sure you're ready to switch =\n\n## = Ensure your existing data directory is backed up\n=\n\nSee how here. Be sure to also do a payment account export to make importing payment accounts easier.\n\n## = Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes\n=\n\nThis is paramount because '''you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.''' If you don't want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.\n\n= Send funds =\n\nYou will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow.\n\nThere are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.\n\n# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from <code>Funds</code> > <code>Send Funds</code>, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in <code>Settings</code> > <code>Preferences</code>).\n#* Variation: Use the Emergency Wallet Tool (<code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>E</code>) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn't working.\n# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it. This method is '''not''' recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See derivation path and other details here.\n# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).\n## Start Bisq.\n## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the <code>appName</code> option. See how to run Bisq from the command line here.\n##* macOS example command: <code>/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new</code>\n##* Name of the new directory doesn't matter. <code>Bisq-new</code> was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it's just a temporary placeholder. You'll be changing it back to \"Bisq\" anyway.\n## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.\n## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.\n\n= Create new data directory =\n\nIf you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:\n# Close Bisq.\n# Delete (or rename) the <code>Bisq</code> data directory (see default locations for your operating system here).\n# Start Bisq again. Bisq will create a new data directory with a new wallet, new Tor state, etc.\n# Send funds from external wallet into Bisq.\n\nIf you used method 3 in the previous step:\n# Make sure ''both'' Bisq instances are closed.\n# Delete (or rename) the original <code>Bisq</code> data directory.\n# Rename the newer data directory to <code>Bisq</code>.\n# Start Bisq normally.

In some cases, multi-threaded java applications allocating few and small objects can trigger creation of one arena for each of those threads, resulting in large growth of the Java process' resident memory, no matter how well on-heap memory is managed by the application.\n\nOne way to limit arena creation in Bisq is to define the environment variable <code>MALLOC_ARENA_MAX</code>.\n\nexport MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4\n\nIf not set (default=0), a combination of applications may create as many arenas as the number of CPU cores * 8.\n\nThis setting reduced resident memory use by ~300 MB, and reduced virtual memory use by ~3.7 GB on an 8-core machine with 16GB RAM running Ubuntu 18.

Smaller changes to existing components, infrastructure, or processes are generally best discussed in other channels (on Matrix, other GitHub repositories, etc).\n\nThis article covers the roles, processes, and conventions for proposals.\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Roles\n\n* Proposals Maintainer\n\n## Processes\n\nAnyone may submit new proposals and/or review other proposals. But there are things you can do to make it more likely your ideas are received well.\n\n## = Submission and Review\n=\n\n##\nResearch and Evaluate\n##\n\nProposals are supposed to be significant items with enough weight to draw attention from core contributors, users, and stakeholders from across functions.\n\nAccordingly, proposals should be well-considered, well-researched, and well-articulated.\n\nAs a result, before submitting a proposal, please:\n# Discuss your idea with other contributors to see if a proposal is worth submitting at all\n# Search through existing proposals (both [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues open and closed]) to see whether something similar has already been proposed\n# Notice which among those proposals have been accepted and rejected, and why\n# Read this article to fully understand the proposal process and guidelines\n\nLook through past proposals that succeeded to get a feel for how they were structured.\n\n##\nCreate GitHub Issue\n##\n\nOnce you've done research, floated your idea in the community in other channels, and think your idea might garner broader support, create a new GitHub issue in the [https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues|bisq-network/proposals repository on GitHub], written and formatted according to the following guidelines:\n\n* Write your proposal in a way that makes it as easy as possible to achieve rough consensus. This means that proposals should be as simple, focused, concrete and well-defined as possible. Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your fellow contributors to understand and agree with you.\n* Take full responsibility for your proposal. It is not the maintainers' job, nor anyone else’s, to see your proposal succeed. If people aren’t responding or reacting to your proposal, it’s your job to solicit that feedback more actively.\n* Never assume that anyone other than yourself is going to do the work described in your proposal. If your proposal does place expectations on other contributors, or requires them to change their behavior in any way, be explicit about that.\n* Provide context. Make a strong case for your proposal. Link to prior discussions. Do not make your reader do any more work than they have to to understand your proposal.\n* Format your proposal well. Make it a pleasure to read.\n\nIn general, good proposals take time to research and write. Every minute you spend clearly and logically articulating your proposal is a minute that you save other contributors in understanding it. This diligence on your part will be appreciated and rewarded by others' attention.\n\nA maintainer will quickly review your proposal and will either (a) assign it to you to indicate your ownership and responsibility over it, or (b) close it and label it as <code>was:incorrect</code> if it does not follow the guidelines listed above.\n\n##\nReview\n##\n\nOnce a proposal is submitted, a two-week review period follows.\n\nDuring this period, interested reviewers should read, discuss and ultimately [https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments react] to the proposal as follows:\n* 👍: I agree with the proposal and want to see it enacted.\n* 😕: I am uncertain about the proposal and I need more information.\n* 👎: I disagree with the proposal and do not want to see it enacted.\n\nTry to provide an explanation of your reaction, especially when reacting with a 😕 or 👎. If you don’t, then don’t expect your opinion to have much weight or get addressed.\n\nIf you do not understand or care about a given proposal, ignore it.\n\nUse comments on the proposal issue to discuss, ask questions, and get clarifications. Take lengthy discussions offline to Matrix or elsewhere and then summarize them back on the issue.\n\n##\nEvaluate\n##\n\nThe proposal review process is all about reaching a rough consensus, meaning that there is a broad agreement that the proposal should be enacted, and that any dissenting opinions have been addressed, though not necessarily fully resolved.\n\nAfter the two-week review period is over, a maintainer will evaluate reactions to and discussions about the proposal and will close the issue with a comment explaining that it is approved or rejected based on whether a rough consensus was achieved.\n\nApproved proposals will be labeled with <code>was:approved</code>. Rejected proposals will be labeled with <code>was:rejected</code>.\n\nIf rough consensus has not been achieved, e.g. because discussion is still ongoing, dissenting concerns have not been addressed, or the proposal has turned out to be contentious, the maintainer will indicate that they cannot close the proposal, and that it is up to the submitter to take next steps to move the proposal forward. One option is to submit the proposal to the DAO for voting. If the proposal does not move forward after another two weeks, the maintainer will close and label it <code>was:stalled</code>.\n\nIf there have been no or very few reactions to a proposal after the two-week period, the maintainer will close it and label it as <code>was:ignored</code>.<!-- was:moved-->\n\n##\nEnact\n##\n\nAssuming your proposal was approved, the next step is to actually enact the changes described in that proposal, perhaps by creating a project or simply getting to work.\n\n## = Submit to the DAO (if needed)\n=\n\nSometimes it is necessary to submit proposals to the DAO for voting:\n* DAO parameter changes\n* proposal for bonded roles\n* contentious proposals for which there is strong interest but no clear consensus\n\nFor most general proposals this should not be necessary—general proposals that have clear consensus (or clear lack of consensus) don't need to be voted upon in the DAO. In any case, a DAO submission should only be considered after considerable discussion on GitHub so that voters have context and reason to vote one way or another. Do not submit a DAO proposal before such discussion is established.\n\nSee how to submit a proposal for DAO voting.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "general"}

For example you could include that you are looking to complete the trade in a Starbucks within the city center.\n\nPlease note it is against Bisq rules to use the 'Additional Information' field to include advertising offers with a way to contact you prior to the trade (e.g. website, phone, email, or Matrix/Keybase/Telegram user name). Doing this can result in a penalty, should someone take your offer and request for you to be penalized.\n\n= Taking a F2F offer =\n\n'''Make sure to check the offer maker's terms and conditions before taking a F2F offer.''' If you cannot fulfill the terms, do not take the the offer. If you have specific terms you would prefer, consider making your own offer instead.\n\n## Meeting your trading partner\n\nDoing a transaction face-to-face means you’ll be coming within close proximity of a stranger to exchange relatively substantial value.\n\n## = Be safe\n=\n\nPeople do local, in-person commerce all the time, all over the world. Incidents are rare, but they do happen. You should be cognizant of risks and do your part to minimize potential harm.\n\n'''Guard your data.''' When you set up a face-to-face payment account in Bisq, you’ll need to provide contact information so you can arrange a meeting with your trading partner. Make sure this information isn’t traceable back to your property or identity.\n\n'''Meet in a neutral public place.''' Meeting your trading partner in a place with witnesses and security cameras significantly reduces the chance of an incident.\n\n'''Don’t bring more than you need.''' Even in a public place, incidents can still happen, but you can limit the chance even further by limiting valuables on your person that would interest a thief in the first place.\n\n'''Bring backup.''' Consider bringing a friend with you. Also, depending on the laws in your area & your own comfort, consider carrying a concealed tool for self-defense. Even pepper-spray can hobble a criminal just enough to get you out of immediate danger.\n\n## = Validate payment\n=\n\nFace-to-face trades are usually settled with cash. Cash is wonderfully anonymous, but it can be counterfeited. Be sure you know the basics of detecting counterfeit currency. For example, there are several characteristics of US dollar bills one can examine to quickly determine fakes with high accuracy.\n\nYou could look for tools like counterfeit pens to do the work for you, but make sure you do thorough research before picking one. Counterfeit pens, for example, are often not reliable.\n\nIf you’d rather not take the chance of carrying or accepting cash, consider meeting at a bank where you can validate a buyer’s payment on the spot.\n\n## = Ensure you follow Bisq protocol\n=\n\nUltimately, the deal will be completed in Bisq. Buyers must mark payment as sent before sellers can release assets.\n\n'''Buyers''' should bring a laptop with them so they can mark the payment as sent. Otherwise, the buyer will end up paying the seller and have to walk away without the bitcoin they paid for (since the seller won’t be able to acknowledge receipt of payment before the buyer acknowledges they sent payment).\n\n'''Sellers''' should bring a laptop with their Bisq client running no matter what. Once they receive a legitimate payment, they’ll need to mark the payment as received so the assets are released to the buyer. No buyer will want to walk away after paying without proof of a complete deal.\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe lack of verifiable actions makes handling face-to-face disputes much harder.\n\nThis is why we highly recommend that both parties bring laptops and acknowledge their ends of the deal on the spot.\n\nOtherwise, the same dispute process is in place for F2F trades, but be advised that mediators and arbitrators often won’t have a way to settle disputes. In such cases, aggrieved traders can send deposit funds arbitration and make an appeal to the Bisq DAO.\n\nHaving said that, mediators and arbitrators may attempt different tactics to get a handle on the situation.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "How to do remittance on Bisq", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''International remittance''' is the transfer of money from one country to another. Bitcoin of course makes it trivial and fast to send value anywhere in the world, but not everyone is on the Bitcoin standard yet and some people still want to be paid in fiat. Bisq can help you create a remittance channel to facilitate fast, cheap international transfers while at the same time earning some profit for your services.\n\nBy using Bisq you can turn an expensive, slow international transfer into two fast, local transfers.\n\nThe role of remittance channel operator is similar to that of market maker (see How to be a market maker on Bisq) the difference being that you operate on two markets at the same time and you need to have fiat accounts for both markets.\n\n1. '''Create an offer''' to BUY Bitcoin on market 1 (eg: USD) at 1% below market price using a fast payment method.\n\n2. '''Create an offer''' to SELL Bitcoin on market 2 (eg: CNY) at 1% above market price using a fast payment method.\n\n3. Tell your client in market 1 (the \"sender\") to '''take''' your first offer (buying Bitcoin from you for USD) --> you receive fiat in market 1.\n\n4. Tell your client in market 2 (the \"receiver\") to '''take''' your second offer (selling you Bitcoin for CNY) --> your receive Bitcoin.\n\n5. The client in market 1 pays fiat and receives Bitcoin. The client in market 2 pays Bitcoin and receives fiat.\n\n6. Repeat!\n\nBoth fiat transactions are local. The remittance operator makes 2% profit with little risk. The remittance client has managed to send fiat internationally and perform currency exchange at very low cost and within 24 hours.\n\nThis business model is perfect for someone who has a physical shop as you can even make the offers '''F2F (in person)''' cash deals and avoid financial institutions altogether.\n\n*For more short guides see Howto.

{"title": "Failed Trades - Reimbursement of Trade Fees and Miner Fees", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nSometimes trades on Bisq fail because of bugs or edge situations, that lead to an invalid deposit transaction: either no deposit txid exists, or the txid is missing from the blockchain (as can be verified on a blockchain explorer).\n\nUsually failed trades will also have an issue with the maker and/or taker txid, caused by an out-of-sync internal Bisq wallet on the party with the failed tx.\n* if miner and trade fees were lost for the BTC buyer and/or seller, a reimbursement can be considered if the lost fees are significant enough, e.g. above $10 of value\n* if no fees were lost, no reimbursement is obviously needed\n* '''no other losses will be caused by a failed trade''', as the deposit tx never happens, so no additional funds will have left your wallet in the first place\n\n__TOC__\n\n## Common reasons for trades to fail\n\nThe most common reason for a trade to fail is either the maker or taker is trading with an out-of-sync bitcoin wallet.\n\nWhen the maker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet they will often be able to 'make' a trade of their choosing. Normally one of two things happen:\n# 1. When the maker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet most often the trade will end up not being displayed on the Bisq Markets for someone to take as the software checks to make sure an offer is valid before propagating it to the peer to peer network. When a trade fails in this way the maker will not have lost any trade fees or miner fees as there was never any maker transaction ID. In this instance the fix is for the maker of the trade to do an SPV resync. Once this is completed they can delete the trade they made by goin to Portfolio > Open Offers and pressing the delete icon next to the trade.\n# 2. Sometimes an invalid maker offer can be shown in a users Bisq instance. If this happens when the taker takes the offer they will lose both mining and trade fees as they will incur costs for the taker transaction ID even though a deposit transaction will not be created. In this case reimbursement can be considered by the taker if the lost fees are significant enough to warrant making a reimbursement request, eg above $10 of value.). In this instance the fix is for the maker of the trade to do an SPV resync.\n\nWhen the taker is trading with an out-of-sync Bisq wallet they will often be able to 'take' a trade of their choosing. Normally one of two things happen:\n# 1. The trade remains in the offer book, the taker transaction and the deposit transaction fails, the trade can be seen on both the buyer's and seller's Bisq instance. The deposit transaction confirmation will show as N/A. This is because the deposit transaction could not be created because the taker transaction failed. In this instance neither the maker or taker will have lost any trade or miner fees. The offer will still be able to be taken in the offer book, and the taker transaction did not confirm so no fees were spent from the takers wallet. In this instance the fix is for the taker of the trade to do an SPV resync.\n# 2. The trade is removed from the offer book, the taker transaction and the deposit transaction fails, the trade can be seen on both the buyer's and seller's Bisq instance. The deposit transaction confirmation will show as being present but a check on a blockchain explorer will show it as an invalid transaction. This is because the deposit transaction could not be created because the taker transaction failed. In this instance the maker will have lost trade and miner fees, but the taker will not have lost any fees. In this case reimbursement can be considered by the maker if the lost fees are significant enough to warrant making a reimbursement request, eg above $10 of value.). In this instance the fix is for the taker of the trade to do an SPV resync.\n\n## Less common reasons for trades to fail\n\nLess common reasons for trades to fail are:\n\n* Bugs in the software\n* Tor network issues\n* A user trading with an out of space hard drive, corrupted wallet, or poor connection to the Bisq network\n\nIn these cases the maker and taker can check their respective transaction IDs.\n\n* If the maker or taker ID failed then the respective user will not have lost any miner or trade fees.\n* If the maker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the maker will not have lost any trade or miner fees IF the deposit transaction shows as N/A\n* If the maker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the maker will have lost trade and mine fees IF the deposit transaction shows as being present but is invalid when checked on the blockchain.\n* If the taker transition ID was successful on the blockchain then the taker will have lost trade and miner fees if the trade failed.\n\nIn instances like the above ideally the trade would end up in mediation and the mediator will request your logs to understand what the issue was that caused the trade to fail and make recommendations for what, if anything, you need to do to avoid future instances of failed trades.\n\n## What failed trades are eligible for reimbursement?\n\nAny user that has lost trade and miner fees is eligible for reimbursement.\n\nTrades are also only eligible for reimbursement if submitted within 3 months from the date of the trade.\n\n## When to consider reimbursement?\n\nIt is important to remember no trade or deposit funds are lost with failed trades. Most of the time if you see your Bisq wallet is missing funds from a failed trade it means your wallet it out-of-sync, which is why the trade failed! Do an SPV resync to fix the issue and your wallet will show the correct balance.\n\nReimbursement of a filed trade requires some work to do in gathering the information and posting it online, it also have some privacy implications as you are having to post maker, taker, and deposit transaction IDs. As a result of this it is often not making reimbursement requests for MOST failed trades as miner and trade fees are usually small (less than a few dollars, local currency equivalent, of value). Therefore, it is recommended traders ONLY request reimbursement for trades where they feel their trade fee and miner fee losses are significant enough to warrant the time to do so. Most of the time this will be for takers with lost trade fees where the trade that failed was a large amount of BTC. For example the maximum trade fee loss on a 1 BTC trade would be 0.0044 BTC. This would be worth requesting reimbursement for.\n\n## What should I do before requesting reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees?\n\nBefore requesting reimbursement for a filed trade you should make sure you are eligible for reimbursement ie you have lost both trade fees and miner fees.\n\nYou should also be aware of what miner fees and reimbursement fees you have lost on the trade. This is important as it means traders are aware of what fees they are claiming before they make a reimbursement request and prevents any misunderstanding of users with failed trades assuming they have lost the trade or deposit amounts when that is not the case, and in most cases can be quickly solved with an SPV Resync.\n\n##\nHow do I know what my miner fees were?\n##\n\nPlease also make sure you know how much miner fees you lost for a trade. This can be checked on blockchain explorer.\n\nthumb|center|This shows where you can find your miner fees on a blockchain explorer such as mempool.space\n\n##\nHow do I know what my trader fees were?\n##\n\nPlease also make sure you know how much trade fees you lost for a trade. This will be a percentage of the trade amount and differs depending on whether you were the maker or taker or chose BTC or BSQ to pay the trade fees.\n\n* BTC trade fees are 0.15% of the trade amount for the maker and 1.15% of the trade amount for the taker.\n* BSQ trade fees are 0.075% of the trade amount for the maker and 0.575% of the trade amount for the taker.\n\nYou can check the latest trading fees here.\n\nYou can verify your BTC fees on any blockchain explorer.\n\nYou can verify your BSQ fees on a BSQ explorer such as https://bisq.markets/ or https://bisq.mempool.emzy.de/\n\n## How to make reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees from a failed trade?\n\nYou can make a reimbursement request for lost miner and trade fees from a failed trade by creating a new issue on the [https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues Bisq GitHub Support repository].\n\nYou will need a GitHub account, to maintain privacy feel free to create on just for the purpose of the reimbursement. There is a [https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=reimbursement-template.md&title=Fee+reimbursement+for+trade+XXXXX template here]* that you should follow to create your reimbursement request.\n\n*This link will only work when you are logged into a GitHub account.\n\nOnce your issue is posted a support agent might ask you some more questions if they need any extra info to what you have provided.\n\nIf your request is a valid one for reimbursement then the [https://bisq.wiki/Fee_Reimbursement_Agent Fee Reimbursement Agent] will add you to their list of reimbursement cases to payout. They usually process reimbursements every 4-8 weeks in batches so please be prepared to wait a little time before reimbursement.

{"title": "Switching to a new data directory", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''Switching to a new data directory''' can help you start with Bisq anew: fresh wallet, new onion address, new keys, etc. It's a sort of \"factory reset\" that makes it like you're starting Bisq for the first time.\n\nUpon creating a new data directory, you can restore various parts of a previous data directory (e.g., aged and signed payment accounts).\n\nIf you instead wish to only obtain a new wallet, while preserving every other element of your data directory, you can create a fresh wallet in the same data directory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Why switch to a new data directory? =\n\nIt's a good idea to switch to a new data directory every so often.\n* '''Performance''' - Bisq uses bitcoinj, an SPV library that is not built for high performance, so wallets get increasingly large with every transaction. Over time, wallet corruption becomes increasingly likely and overall performance deteriorates (e.g., longer startup times).\n* '''Stability''' - The internal wallet database can get corrupted in certain situations, leading to failed take-offer attempts or failed payouts.\n* '''Privacy''' - Active traders using the same onion address for extended periods of time can leak quite a bit of information, since that same onion address is connected to each subsequent offer (see local reputation).\n\nIn addition, switching to a new data directory can sometimes be the only way to work around unusual wallet corruption issues.\n\n= Make sure you're ready to switch =\n\n## = Ensure your existing data directory is backed up\n=\n\nSee how here. Be sure to also do a payment account export to make importing payment accounts easier.\n\n## = Ensure you have no open offers, trade, or disputes\n=\n\nThis is paramount because '''you will become unreachable and unable to respond after switching to a new data directory.''' If you don't want to wait for an open offer to be taken, you can delete it, but you will lose the maker fee.\n\n= Send funds =\n\nYou will need to get your funds to the new Bisq instance somehow.\n\nThere are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your situation.\n\n# Send funds to an external wallet with a withdrawal from <code>Funds</code> > <code>Send Funds</code>, and then send those funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it (note: you can set withdrawal transaction fees in <code>Settings</code> > <code>Preferences</code>).\n#* Variation: Use the Emergency Wallet Tool (<code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>E</code>) to withdraw funds if standard withdrawal isn't working.\n# Restore your wallet from seed in another bitcoin wallet like Electrum, and send funds to the new Bisq instance once you've created it. This method is '''not''' recommended if you have any BSQ funds in your wallet. See derivation path and other details here.\n# Send funds directly from old Bisq instance to new Bisq instance (advanced).\n## Start Bisq.\n## Start another instance of Bisq from the command line, specifying a new data directory with the <code>appName</code> option. See how to run Bisq from the command line here.\n##* macOS example command: <code>/Applications/Bisq.app/Contents/MacOS/Bisq --appName=Bisq-new</code>\n##* Name of the new directory doesn't matter. <code>Bisq-new</code> was used above as an example, but you can call it whatever you like, since it's just a temporary placeholder. You'll be changing it back to \"Bisq\" anyway.\n## Wait for this new instance of Bisq to start and finish loading and syncing.\n## Once it has, send your funds from your old Bisq instance to your new one.\n\n= Create new data directory =\n\nIf you used methods 1 or 2 in the previous step:\n# Close Bisq.\n# Delete (or rename) the <code>Bisq</code> data directory (see default locations for your operating system here).\n# Start Bisq again. Bisq will create a new data directory with a new wallet, new Tor state, etc.\n# Send funds from external wallet into Bisq.\n\nIf you used method 3 in the previous step:\n# Make sure ''both'' Bisq instances are closed.\n# Delete (or rename) the original <code>Bisq</code> data directory.\n# Rename the newer data directory to <code>Bisq</code>.\n# Start Bisq normally. Your balance should reflect the BTC you sent to it previously.\n\n= Migrate data from backup =\n\nIf you'd like to restore payment accounts and/or your onion address (e.g., local reputation), see how in this article.", "category": "general"}
{"title": "Installing your own Bitcoin node", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\nIt is best practice that any Bitcoin user installs his own node, to send and verify his own transactions; moreover, if you use Bisq consistently, you are strongly encouraged to do so, as it will make the bitcoin network connection much more stable, and especially reduce the risk of needing SPV resync on a wallet that contains many transactions. Even when a SPV resync is needed, it will be much painless if done while connected to your own node.\n\n__TOC__\n\n= Hardware requirements =\n\nThe most demanding part of a full Bitcoin node is disk space: 1TB is considered the bare minimum (2TB is better for future proofing your node), and a SSD is recommended, as the constant write operations would risk damaging the average mechanical disk. There are pruned nodes that will only keep the very last blocks of the blockchain in order to save on disk space, but as Bisq needs a fully verifying node, we will only be examining this case in the present guide.\n\nThe following are viable hardware options to host the node:\n* refurbished laptop with at least 8GB of RAM\n** pros: comes with display, keyboard, and basic storage (existing storage will need to be replaced or expanded), can run multiple services and act as a full fledged home server, has builtin UPS\n** cons: drains more power and is more expensive than a Raspberry Pi 3, takes up more space on your shelf\n* dedicated Raspberry Pi 3\n** pros: very small, low power, completely silent\n** cons: no builtin display, keyboard nor storage, very low performance, needs more initial maintenance\n* your daily driver machine\n** pros: no need to source additional hardware (except the additional storage if it's not enough), will likely not suffer from the limited additional overhead of a Bitcoin node while you use it normally\n** cons: you either have to leave it always running, to keep updated with blocks as soon as they are mined, or will have to wait a variable amount of time for it to catch up to the current block height each time you turn it on, before you can use Bisq\n\n= Installing the software =\n\nWhen installing the Bitcoin node software, you will be either working on a graphical user interface, or on a system that only operates via command line (most likely the Raspberry).\n\n## Systems with graphical interface\n\nUnless you want to install a leaner daemon setup and follow the command-line steps below, installing directly on a graphical interface is the easier path, as you can download and verify the files as per the instructions on https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ and then install the software as you normally would on your operating system, making sure you point it to the 1TB drive to save the blockchain.\n\n## Systems with command line interface\n\nYou may choose to run a dedicated refurbished laptop on Linux and without a desktop environment, and it would be a wise choice; regarding a Raspberry, while you could install a graphical desktop environment on a Pi 3, it is absolutely not recommended to do so, because it will be a self-contained system that will only cater to the task of running the node software, and any additional load, like keeping the graphical interface in memory, will degrade its performance.\n\nThere is a well known step-by-step guide that will illustrate how to install a full Bitcoin Node on a Raspberry, called the [https://raspibolt.org/ RaspiBolt Guide], plus its amd64/desktop counterpart, directed at laptops/PCs, called [https://minibolt.info MiniBolt]. They both include a section dedicated to installing software for a Lightning Network node, but you will only need to follow the guide for your system up to the configuration of the Bitcoin client.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThere have been multiple reports about the Ronin node package not allowing Bisq to connect (after the first time), and we know no tested solution for this issue, so it is recommended using the steps above to obtain the Bitcoin node software.\n\n## Common steps\n\nNo matter the path you chose above, you will have to wait a considerable amount of time after installing the node.\n\nThe initial block download will have your Bitcoin client fetch from the p2p network, and verify one by one, all the blocks since the genesis, which at the time of writing amounts to 570GB of data, so expect from 2 to 10 days of uninterrupted CPU and network activity, depending on the connection (whether clearnet or Tor) and the performance of the hardware (a faster machine will complete the block verification and writing to disk in less time)\n\n= Setup the node to accept connections from Bisq =\n\nFor the bitcoin connection on Bisq to be effective, you will need to make sure the node's configuration is correct.\nIf you installed the client via command line interface following the guides linked above, you will probably have a working config file already, but in case you installed the GUI client, you will have to manually edit the <code>bitcoin.conf</code> file from within the settings, and make sure it contains the following:\n\n<code>server=1</code><br>\n<code>prune=0</code><br>\n<code>peerbloomfilters=1</code><br>\n\nwhich in turn:\n* enable the block server mode\n* disable the pruning of old blocks\n* allow Bisq to run SPV queries on the node\n\nIf the node is running on a separate machine, but on the same local network, it needs to listen for connections from external clients as well, and the easiest way of doing this is to add the following to the config file:\n\n<code>bind=0.0.0.0</code>\n\nNo need for the above if the node runs on a different network, and you will connect to it via Tor.\n\nAfter any change to the <code>bitcoin.conf</code> file, the bitcoin client needs to be restarted.\n\nIf, on the same remote machine running the node, you installed <code>ufw</code> as the Bolt guides suggest, you have to allow incoming connections on port 8333 (edit the local network base address as needed):\n\n<code>sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/24 to any port 8333 comment 'Bitcoin p2p'</code>\n\n= Setup the connection from Bisq to the node =\n\nThe following will change depending on where the node is located respectively to Bisq.\n\n## Connecting to a node on the same PC\n\nIf the Bitcoin node is installed on the same machine as Bisq, the latter will automatically connect to it without the need to edit anything. Considering how Bisq will only run on amd64 architecture, you can achieve this with either your daily driver, or a dedicated laptop/desktop through direct or remote access (for example via xpra).\n\nMake sure no other Bitcoin-based altcoin nodes (like LTC) are running while starting Bisq.\n\n## Connecting to a Bitcoin node on the same local network\n\nAfter setting the config file to accept connections from external machines, as explained above, you will have to setup Bisq to connect to the remote node. This should be achieved by launching Bisq with the following command-line parameters (as an example, the node on the local network is at 10.0.0.21, edit the command to match your situation):\n\n<code>Bisq -btcNodes=10.0.0.21:8333 -useTorForBtc=false</code>\n\nOnce Bisq has started, you should verify under Settings > Network, that these settings are replicated, in particular you should see that the node's IP:port is filled in the address field, and the \"Use Tor for Bitcoin Network\" checkbox is disabled.\n\n## Connecting to a remote node through the Tor Network\n\nIf you installed the node software on a machine that is geographically separate from your local network, and you followed the Bolt guides, it will be already connecting to the internet through Tor, so you can point Bisq to its onion address.\n\nOn the node's machine's shell, run\n\n<code>bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion</code>\n\nto obtain your onion address, copy it to the clipboard and paste it in Bisq under Settings > Network > Use Custom Bitcoin Core nodes\n\nBisq will offer to restart, thus connecting to the custom remote node.\n\n= Verify the connection =\n\nOnce you connect to your own node, Bisq will show <code>Bitcoin network peers: 1</code> in the bottom right corner, and under Settings > Network you will notice the node is the only one listed under \"Bitcoin network\".\n\n= Troubleshooting =\n\nIf you get into a state where Bisq is unable to connect, you can revert to a provided node as follows.\n\nFor MacOS:\n<code>Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true </code>\n\nFor Linux:\n\n<code>/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true </code>\n\nFor Windows:\n\n<code>C:\\Users\\your-username-here\\AppData\\Local\\Bisq\\Bisq.exe -btcNodes=devinbtctu7uctl7hly2juu3thbgeivfnvw3ckj3phy6nyvpnx66yeyd.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true </code>\n\nContributor nodes can be seen [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/7c07cdb6ff60ad1186dea33acdfb688668c2aae6/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/btc/nodes/BtcNodes.java#L51-L76 in the Bisq code].\n\nMore info on running from the command line.\n\nMore info on command line options.", "category": "general"}

{"title": "Mining fees", "content": "<!-- BISQ VERSION: General -->\n<!-- This page is classified as General content -->\n\n'''Mining fees''' are BTC paid to miners to include a BTC transaction into a block.\nThe amount of BTC to be paid depends on a mining fee market driven by the amount of blocks produced by miners and demand for block space, and also the size of the transaction. This price is expressed in sat/vB or satoshis per byte. BTC transactions waiting to be included into a BTC block wait at the mempools of BTC nodes, and only those offering a higher sats/vB to miners will be included for every block. Mempool state can be seen at most blockchain explorers, like [http://www.mempool.space mempool.space].\nBisq use segwit addresses by default to save space on the blockchain and hence, mining fees.\n\n500px|thumb|left\n\n## = Mining fees to trade\n=\nRequired mining fees for trading are estimated by Bisq. Traders can't decide how much to pay because underpaying mining fees would cause delays or even make trades fail. Fee rate to be used is fed by seednodes and displayed at the bottom left of the window.\nThe total BTC to be paid is displayed before making or taking any offer. As makers only publish a single transaction to create an offer (maker trading fee transaction) and takers have to publish three (taker trading fee, deposit and payout transactions), taking an offer pays approximately 3 times more in mining fees than making an offer. This is because offer makers cannot know what mining fees will be at the time their offer is taken.\nUnlike trading fees, mining fees to pay are independent to the trade amount. A higher trade will relatively pay less mining fees than a small trade.\n\n## = Mining fees to withdraw\n=\nWhen sending BTC from Bisq wallet to other BTC addresses, you can use the mining fee recommended by Bisq or set your own at the <code>Funds / Send funds</code> tab. If you have used very small fees, it could not be included.

Such languages currently include the following:\n* French (fr)\n* Chinese (zh_CN, zh_TW) (on hold until mobile app is available)\n* German (de)\n* Italian (it)\n* Japanese (jp)\n* Portuguese (pt)\n* Russian (ru)\n* Spanish (es)\n\n__TOC__\n\n## How to contribute\n\nBisq uses [https://explore.transifex.com/bisq/ Transifex] to translate the three projects it currently has:\n* bisq-desktop\n* bisq-website\n* bisq-subtitles\n\nTasks are coordinated on the bisq.chat [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.growth:bitcoin.kyoto #Growth] channel.\n\nTo contribute, please register on Transifex and request to be included as translator for a language. Transifex will send corresponding notifications to [https://docs.transifex.com/teams/understanding-user-roles managers and coordinators], but it's better to also introduce yourself and what you'd like to do on Matrix.\n\n## Objectives\n\n## = Keep core languages for bisq-desktop up-to-date\n=\n\nThere's no budget to update all core languages in every DAO cycle. Languages will be updated one-by-one, starting with the markets which offer more trading volume for Bisq.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n* Strings labeled as <code>no_translate</code> are strings referring to unused altcoins and region specific strings that should be left untranslated or translated using the original English version. If left translated with the original source, don't submit them for compensation.\n\n* There's no budget for reviews: translated strings will be uploaded and used in the next version release. If a string is confusing, ask for help or leave it for later.\n\n* '''All translations work should be done on Transifex!''' Please don't open pull requests to modify non-English text. The Bisq software and website repositories include scripts to automatically integrate all changes on Transifex.\n\n* Propose any changes to English text on GitHub ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/i18n/displayStrings.properties here] for Bisq software and [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-website/blob/master/_data/en.yml here] for the website).\n\n## Compensation\n\nAs with all Bisq contributions, contributors who want to be compensated for their work should make a [https://docs.bisq.network/compensation.html compensation request].\n\n'''Only work designated as high-priority by the Transifex Admin will be compensated.''' Before you begin, make sure your work has been designated as high-priority by the Transifex Admin. Upon making a compensation request, the Transifex Admin will acknowledge your work to reaffirm your work's priority before voting begins.\n\n* A rate of 0.07 USD/word translated to the cycle's BSQ equivalent will be used-\n\n* Compensation requests for translations are submitted with screenshots of the Transifex translation panel. The filters used to create a valid screenshot are: <code>translator:<your_username> translated_after:<date_since_last_request></code>. Be careful, as this query returns every string the specified user last edited, even if the edit is a tiny change from a review instead of a translation. There is no budget for reviews, but if you want to do a review anyway, make sure the original translator has already has been compensated, or that they know how many words they translated (and that they have the requisite proof for their compensation request).\n\nSee [https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/415 this compensation request] as an example.\n\nCategory:Processes", "category": "general"}
