{"title": "Security deposit", "content": "'''Security deposits''' in Bisq are BTC funds that buyer and seller lock in a 2of2 multisig address together with trade funds when an offer is taken in order to help ensure that both peers follow the trading protocol. Security deposits are fully reimbursed automatically to both trading peers when the trade ends without [[dispute resolution|disputes]]. Security deposits are the most important tool Bisq offers to protect honest traders. Furthermore, requiring ''both'' parties to post a deposit increases chances that they will be willing to cooperate and determine amicable outcomes in case a trade doesn't go according to plan. When a trade doesn't go the happy path, a portion or the total amount of the offending peer's deposit will be lost, depending on whether the trade is concluded in mediation or arbitration. For example, it is considered a protocol violation when the buyer doesn't pay the seller as specified in the trade contract (e.g., late payment, mismatching names, wrong payment method, etc). [[Trading_rules|This article]] lists all Bisq trading rules. == Note for new users == Security deposits create a conundrum for new users: '''bitcoin is required to buy bitcoin'''. This can be inconvenient, but it's a core part of the security protocol. The initial amount of BTC required to do a trade can vary depending on the payment method, but the bare minimum BTC required to buy more BTC (as of this writing) is 0.002 BTC to cover the minimum security deposit and mining fees. Take a look at [[Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin|this article]] for suggestion on how to get this initial BTC without KYC ([[Bisq Easy]], [[Getting_your_first_BTC|Get your first BTC]] room, a friend, ATM, sell something, work for it, etc). Why the hard security deposit requirement? Bisq never custodies your funds, and it avoids reputation mechanisms that would weaken your privacy (e.g., reviews: to such reputation data, it must be stored somewhere ''and'' tied to an identity). Such mechanisms would only give a false sense of security anyway due to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attacks]. == Recommended amounts == Bisq allows offer makers to choose a security deposit percentage: '''minimum is 15%''' of trade amount and '''maximum is 50%''' of trade amount (absolute minimum is 0.001 BTC). The offer taker must deposit the same amount as the offer maker. When creating an offer, Bisq recommends a security deposit based on recent volatility of the asset being traded: '''the higher the volatility, the higher the recommended security deposit'''. Using the recommended amount helps prevent trades from becoming future trades where the BTC buyer only sends payment to settle the trade if the BTC price has not fallen enough to compensate for losing the security deposit. {{Admonition_Note|Deposits and trade amounts are locked in the multisignature address to secure trades. So a peer selling 1 BTC who chooses to specify a 25% security deposit when making his offer will need to lock 1.25 BTC, which would require the buyer to lock 0.25 BTC when taking the offer. Ultimately, this means 1.5 BTC will be locked in a 2-of-2 multisig address when the deposit transaction is confirmed, and only at that point can the buyer send payment to the seller.}} [[File:Security deposit 1.png|500px|thumb|left|Depending on volatility, recommended security deposits can reach 50%.]] <br clear=all> When taking an offer, the security deposit set by the maker can be viewed on the <code>Deposit BTC (%)</code> column. [[File:Security deposit 2.png|500px|thumb|left|See required deposit % in this column on the offer book.]] <br clear=all> == Reduced peer's deposit payout during arbitration == The latest trade protocol, which introduced contributors as BurningMen, to reimburse arbitrators and refund overpaid fees for traders, reduces the amount an offending peer receives back from their security deposit in arbitration. In most cases (excluding fraud, where a full penalty is applied) the offending peer gets 50% of their security deposit back, instead of 100%. This means the other 50% is paid out to the BurningMan (not the other trader). See the [[Trade_dispute#Arbitration_payouts|trade dispute]] article for details. '''Note:''' The mediating contributor (mediator) is not paid by this mechanism. == Security deposit amount during a reimbursement request == If a reimbursement request is made for a failed trade, the funds from the losing trader’s security deposit that would have been burned by the BurningMan are instead sent to the DAO donation address (effectively burned via the next BSQ issuance). For successful reimbursement requests, the DAO pays out trade amount plus deposit to the counterparty as normal.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Burning Men", "content": "'''Burning Men''' is the name given to Bisq contributors who choose to burn BSQ in order to receive bitcoin from Bisq trading activity: [[Trading_fees|Trade fees]] and Delayed payout transactions. A contributor becomes a Burning Man by making an account on the Bisq network and burning a specified amount of BSQ. Once the BSQ is burnt, that contributor’s Burning Man account becomes eligible to receive trading fees and delayed payout fees from Bisq trades (in bitcoin). From that point on, each time a trade is completed on the network, the trading fee (or reimbursement payout) is sent to one of the registered Burning Man accounts. The [[Bisq DAO]] then issues BSQ to compensate the contributor for those burnt BSQ (subject to voting). Burning Man was introduced to decentralize the role of arbitrator (used in Bisq prior to v1.2). Burning Men **do not** resolve disputes or have any special authority; their sole function is to burn BSQ and receive BTC. The concept is intended to distribute trading fees and reimbursement payouts in a decentralized way while removing the need for a single trusted arbitrator holding funds. == Burning Man account registration == To register as a Burning Man, a contributor must burn a certain amount of BSQ as proof-of-burn. This is done in the Bisq client by navigating to Account > DAO > Burning Man and following the instructions to burn BSQ and create the account. After burning the required BSQ, the contributor’s account is announced on the network as a Burning Man, making it eligible to receive BTC from trading fees and delayed payouts. The amount of BSQ that needs to be burned to register as a Burning Man can vary over time and is determined by DAO governance. **Note:** Burning BSQ is a cost (a sacrifice) – it is not refunded or recovered later. The BSQ is permanently destroyed. == Receiving trading fees == Once registered, a Burning Man will start receiving a portion of trading fees from each Bisq trade in the form of BTC. The Bisq protocol randomly selects one of the active Burning Man accounts for each trade and directs the trading fee to that account’s address. Over many trades, each Burning Man should receive fees roughly proportional to their share of the total BSQ burned among all Burning Men. For example, if a Burning Man contributed 10% of all BSQ burned by active Burning Men, they might expect to receive roughly 10% of the trading fees over time. == Receiving delayed payout fees == Bisq’s trade protocol includes a mechanism called the delayed payout transaction (DPT). If a trade fails to complete normally and goes to arbitration, the arbitrator creates a delayed payout transaction that distributes funds appropriately. Burning Men are eligible to receive the BTC output of these delayed payout transactions as well (subject to random selection just like trading fees). == Incentives and BSQ compensation == Burning Men burn BSQ upfront, incurring a **cost** in order to gain the ability to earn BTC from fees. To compensate them for this cost and incentivize participation, the Bisq DAO periodically issues new BSQ to Burning Men based on the amount of BTC they have earned. In each DAO voting cycle, Burning Men can submit compensation requests to receive BSQ for the BTC they earned (the BSQ amount typically targeting the burned BSQ cost plus an expected return). This effectively reimburses their burned BSQ over time. **Example:** Alice burns 1000 BSQ to become a Burning Man. Over the next month, she earns 0.1 BTC in trading and payout fees. In the next DAO cycle, she requests compensation for that 0.1 BTC. If 0.1 BTC is worth 1200 BSQ at the current BSQ market price, and her request is approved by the DAO vote, she receives 1200 BSQ. Alice initially spent 1000 BSQ (burned) and got back 1200 BSQ, netting a 200 BSQ gain (which is her profit for providing the service). The exact compensation rates and formulas can vary and are subject to DAO governance and market conditions. == Monitoring Burning Man performance == Bisq provides some statistics to monitor how Burning Man accounts are performing. In the DAO > Burning Man screen, contributors can see: * **Network Fee Distribution** – the portion of trading fees each Burning Man is receiving out of total fees, updated in real time (this changes as new Burning Men join or leave and as trades occur). * **Burned BSQ** – total BSQ burned by the contributor for their Burning Man account. * **Earned BTC** – total BTC earned to date from trading fees and delayed payouts. * **Compensation received** – total BSQ compensated by the DAO for their burned BSQ. Burning Men can use these stats to gauge profitability. If the BTC earned (and compensated in BSQ) exceeds the BSQ burned (cost) by a sufficient margin, the role is profitable. If not, it may discourage participation or signal that the required burn amount needs adjustment. == Historical context == The Burning Man role was introduced via a Bisq DAO proposal in 2020 as part of upgrading the dispute resolution system. It replaced the earlier single arbitrator model with a decentralized fee distribution mechanism. This change improved decentralization (no funds held in escrow by arbitrators) and created an incentive for contributors to participate in keeping the network secure and operational. The term “Burning Man” is an analogy to the famous festival, implying the burning of BSQ as a kind of sacrifice for the good of the community. Initially, only a couple of contributors ran Burning Man nodes, but over time more have joined. The BSQ burn requirement and compensation mechanism have been tweaked through DAO proposals to balance incentives. As Bisq evolves (especially with Bisq v2 and new trade protocols), the Burning Man role may further adapt or eventually phase out if not needed.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Getting your first BTC", "content": "To help new Bisq users who don't already have enough bitcoin to use Bisq, there is an '''informal market for small BTC trades'''. Trades take place on the [[Matrix bisq.chat]] space, in the [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room. You need to join [https://www.bisq.chat bisq.chat] first to be allowed to join the ''Get your first BTC'' room. As of 2024, the get your first BTC room has now been largely replaced by [[Bisq Easy]]. This article covers benefits, risks, and rules to be aware of when using this informal BTC marketplace. {{Admonition_Warn|This marketplace takes the form of a Matrix chat room, so trades are NOT secured by any of the security mechanisms of Bisq software (e.g. multi-signature escrows, mediation, arbitration, DAO, etc). Therefore be aware that such trading is inherently risky. See [[#Risks|risks]] below.}} __TOC__ == Background == For new users, Bisq requires between 0.002 and 0.007 BTC for traders to make their first trade: * 0.001 - 0.006 BTC security deposit * 0.001 BTC miner fee and trade fee It can be difficult for new bitcoiners to acquire their first coins, so this requirement is often a barrier for new Bisq users. The [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq.btc:bitcoin.kyoto Get your first BTC] room offers one possible way to get this initial bitcoin without signing up for a centralized exchange. Other solutions are listed at [[Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin|Funding your wallet]]. == Risks == Make sure you understand these risks before trading: * **Not entirely anonymous** – Unless you access through Tor, your IP address and other usage metrics may reveal your identity. * **Must trust traders** – Trades are not secured by deposits as they are on Bisq. You are relying on the seller’s honesty and the informal reputation system in the chat. * **No dispute resolution** – Trades depend solely on the mutual cooperation of traders. Bisq’s arbitration/mediation system **does not apply** to these informal trades. If something goes wrong (e.g. no payment sent, no BTC sent), there is no Bisq mediator or arbitrator to turn to. * **Scams are possible** – As with any peer-to-peer trading without collateral, scams (like chargebacks or refusal to pay) are possible. * **Room could be shut down** – Since this marketplace relies on a Matrix chat room, it could be closed or censored, disrupting this avenue for obtaining BTC. == Procedure == The basic flow for using the ''Get your first BTC'' room is: # **Join the chat** – Access the Matrix room where small BTC trades are arranged. # **Find a seller** – Look for a seller advertising that they are willing to sell small amounts of BTC, or post that you are looking to buy. # **Agree on terms** – Negotiate the amount, price, and payment method with the seller via chat. Typically these trades are for small amounts (e.g. $50 or $100 worth of BTC). # **Pay the seller** – Send the fiat payment to the seller using the agreed method (bank transfer, Revolut, etc.). # **Receive BTC** – Once the seller confirms receipt of your payment, they will send BTC to your provided address. # **Build reputation** – Often sellers and buyers will leave feedback in the room or maintain a list of trusted counterparties. Successful trades can make it easier to find partners for future trades. This entire process is outside of the Bisq application. It’s essentially an honor-system trade arranged over chat. == Tips == * Start with a very small amount (e.g. $20) for your first trade to test the process and build trust. * Check if the seller has a reputation in the community (do others vouch for them in the room?). * Use a payment method that is low-risk for the seller (some sellers may insist on methods that have no chargeback risk). * Once you get a little BTC, consider using it to do a Bisq trade normally — that will give you a feel for Bisq’s protocol with safety deposits. * Always be cautious and don’t trade more than you are willing to lose in case of a problem. == Alternatives == * **Bisq Easy:** Since March 2024, [[Bisq Easy]] (a Bisq 2 protocol) allows new users to buy BTC without having any to start, using a reputation-based approach. This is now the recommended way for beginners to get bitcoin through Bisq, as it’s integrated in the app (though it has its own risks, be sure to read about them). * **Bitcoin ATMs:** If available in your area, Bitcoin ATMs can be a quick way to get a small amount of BTC (often without ID for small purchases), though fees can be high. * **Ask a friend:** If you know someone with BTC, you could buy a small amount from them directly. * **Earn BTC:** Offer a small service or sell an item in exchange for BTC. Earning bitcoin directly can sometimes be easier than buying for first-timers.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Funding your wallet", "content": "Before trading on Bisq, it's necessary to '''fund your wallet''' with bitcoin. This is because making and taking offers on Bisq requires traders to post a security deposit and pay fees with bitcoin. **Bitcoin is needed even if you intend to sell BTC** (e.g., to pay the trading fees). Here are the basics of funding your Bisq wallet: __TOC__ == Adding funds == Bisq’s built-in wallet is a Bitcoin wallet. To add BTC funds to it, you need to send BTC from another source (another wallet or exchange) to your Bisq wallet address. You can find your Bisq wallet’s receive address by going to Account > Wallet > Receive funds. Use that address to send BTC into Bisq. The funds will appear in Bisq after the transaction gets sufficient confirmations on the Bitcoin network (usually **2 confirmations** by default). == Minimum amount needed == The **minimum BTC balance** needed to start trading depends on the trade amount and deposit percentage required by offers: * **Security deposit:** Minimum 0.001 BTC (this is the smallest deposit you can set or encounter). Often higher in practice (e.g. 15% of trade amount). * **Mining fees:** You need enough to cover transaction fees for the Bisq trade transactions. These can be ~0.0003–0.0005 BTC or more, depending on network conditions. * **Trade fee:** If paying fees in BTC (instead of BSQ), you need the BTC trade fee (usually 0.00005 BTC for the maker, 0.00005 BTC for the taker; or higher if the trade amount is large). In summary, **at least ~0.002 BTC** is recommended to fund a new Bisq wallet to comfortably start trading (covers minimum deposit + fees). If you intend to take offers requiring bigger deposits or want a buffer for multiple trades, you should fund more. == How to get bitcoin == If you’re new to Bitcoin and don’t have any BTC yet, here are a few ways to get your first bitcoin: * **Bisq Easy:** (New in Bisq v2) If you have Bisq 2, you can use the Bisq Easy protocol to buy BTC without having any to start (no security deposit needed). * **Get your first BTC room:** Bisq community runs a Matrix chat room where new users can buy small amounts of BTC from established users informally. See [[Getting your first BTC]] for details. * **Bitcoin ATM:** Many cities have ATMs where you can insert cash and receive bitcoin to a wallet address. This can be quick, though fees might be high. * **Friend or local meetup:** If you know someone who has BTC, or attend a Bitcoin meetup, you could buy directly from a person you trust. * **Earn BTC:** Offer goods or services for bitcoin. For example, sell something online and ask to be paid in BTC. * **Other P2P methods:** There are other peer-to-peer platforms (HodlHodl, LocalCryptos, etc.) where you might find ways to trade for BTC without KYC. Using these methods, you can acquire a small amount of bitcoin, then deposit it into Bisq to start trading within Bisq itself. == Transferring funds out == If you have BTC in your Bisq wallet that you want to move out (to an external wallet or exchange), you can go to Account > Wallet > Send funds. Enter the destination address and amount, and send. Keep in mind there will be a Bitcoin network fee for the transaction, deducted from your Bisq balance. (If you withdraw your full balance, Bisq will automatically subtract the fee so you don’t end up short.) == Troubleshooting == * If your deposit transaction doesn’t appear in Bisq after a few confirmations, check that you sent to the correct address and that your Bisq software is connected/synced to the network (e.g., network status icon is green). * If you accidentally sent too little and cannot take an offer due to insufficient funds, you’ll need to fund a bit more and wait for that to confirm. * Remember that BSQ can be used to pay trading fees (which reduces the BTC needed), but you still need BTC for security deposits and mining fees.", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Frequently asked questions", "content": "Below is a compilation of '''frequently-asked questions (FAQ)''' about Bisq, how to use it, and how to help the project. Feel free to ask further questions on any of Bisq's many communication channels (see [[#Community|Community]] at the end). __TOC__ == Using Bisq (Trading) == **1. Do I have to keep Bisq running to keep my offers online?** Yes. Your computer (and Bisq application) must be online for your offers to be visible to others. If you shut down Bisq, your offers will disappear from the offer book until you restart. **2. What cryptocurrencies does Bisq support?** Bisq supports trading Bitcoin (BTC) for a wide range of national currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.) and a number of other cryptocurrencies (altcoins like XMR, DASH, ZEC, etc.). Bitcoin is the base currency; you cannot trade one fiat for another fiat, or one altcoin for another altcoin directly on Bisq – it always involves BTC on one side of the trade. **3. What payment methods are available?** Bisq supports various payment methods for fiat, such as bank transfers (SEPA, Domestic bank transfer, Faster Payments, etc.), online payment services (Revolut, Zelle, Uphold, etc.), and some proprietary methods. The exact list can be found on the [[Payment methods]] page. Each payment method has its own maximum trade limits and requirements. **4. Are there trade limits?** Yes. New accounts start with small trade size limits (e.g., $1000 for bank transfers) which grow over time (up to a point) as the account ages. See [[Account limits]] for details on trade limit progression and how account age is calculated. Altcoin trades (crypto-to-crypto) have different limits (often higher or no limit). **5. Do I need to provide ID or do any KYC to use Bisq?** No. Bisq is designed to be used without requiring identification or verification. It does not have any concept of user accounts beyond the local account on your computer. Trades are done peer-to-peer without a central authority. However, be aware that some payment methods (like banks) inherently reveal your identity to the counterparty (e.g., your name on a bank transfer). **6. What are Bisq’s fees?** There are trading fees and mining fees. Trading fees can be paid in BSQ (Bisq’s DAO token) for a discount, or in BTC. Additionally, both traders must lock up a security deposit (returned if all goes well) to ensure honest behavior. See [[Trading fees]] for the current fee structure and [[Security deposit]] for deposit info. **7. Why do I need a security deposit?** The security deposit is an incentive mechanism to make sure both parties follow the protocol. If a trader tries to cheat or doesn’t fulfill their part, they can lose their deposit. It helps prevent scams and ensure disputes are resolved fairly. (See [[Security deposit]] for details.) **8. What if a trade goes wrong (dispute)?** Bisq has a 3-tier dispute resolution: (1) **Mediation:** If a trade goes past its deadline or an issue arises, either party can open a mediation ticket. A mediator (a Bisq contributor) will join the chat and try to help resolve the issue. Mediators do not have any power to enforce outcomes, they only suggest a fair resolution. (2) **Arbitration:** If mediation fails, it can be elevated to arbitration. An arbitrator (a bonded role in the Bisq DAO, also called a “Refund Agent” in v1) can finalize the outcome by moving funds from the multisig to the appropriate party according to Bisq’s rules. (3) **DAO reimbursement:** In rare cases, if something goes wrong outside the traders’ control (like a bug or scam where the rules weren’t followed), traders can request reimbursement from the Bisq DAO (paid in BSQ) through a proposal vote. **9. How long does a trade take?** It depends on the payment method. For fiat trades, the payment speed (e.g., SEPA can be same-day or next-day, Zelle is instant) is the main factor. Bisq also enforces a payment window (e.g., 6 days for SEPA) to ensure trades complete in a reasonable time or can be disputed. Altcoin trades are usually faster (within an hour or two) since they involve blockchain transactions that confirm relatively quickly. **10. What if my peer disappears during a trade?** If the other trader goes offline and does not complete their part (e.g., buyer pays but seller never releases BTC, or vice versa), you should open a mediation after the payment window expires. The mediator will attempt to contact the peer and resolve it. If the peer truly disappeared, eventually the issue can be taken to arbitration. The deposit system ensures the disappearing peer has something to lose (their deposit) for not following through. **11. Is Bisq safe?** Bisq is designed with security in mind: it’s non-custodial (funds are in a 2-of-2 multisig, not held by Bisq), and it uses security deposits to discourage fraud. However, it’s not without risk. You must be cautious about who you trade with (for fiat trades, there’s always a risk of chargeback fraud, etc.). Use the built-in protection mechanisms and follow the rules. Bisq also protects privacy through Tor, so as long as you use it as intended, it keeps you relatively anonymous. **12. Why is my trade amount limited?** When you create a new payment account in Bisq, you start with a low trading limit (e.g., 0.01 BTC for new bank accounts). This limit increases over time as your account gets older (0.25 BTC after 2 months, etc.). This is to mitigate fraud risks — a scammer cannot just create a new account and trade huge amounts immediately. See [[Account limits]] for the exact limits and schedule. **13. Can I run Bisq over Tor only?** Yes, Bisq uses Tor by default for all network communication. There’s also an option to use your own Bitcoin full node for SPV (to avoid using public nodes). Running Bisq on a VPN or clearnet is not recommended or supported. **14. Do I need to run a Bitcoin node?** It’s not required — Bisq will work with its built-in SPV chain verification. However, it’s **highly recommended** for privacy and reliability to use your own Bitcoin node if possible. Bisq allows connecting to your local node (see [[Installing your own Bitcoin node]] for guidance on setting one up). **15. What is BSQ?** BSQ is the token used in the Bisq DAO for governance and fee payments. BSQ is basically colored Bitcoin — it’s bitcoin that has been marked (through a genesis transaction) to represent shares in Bisq. BSQ holders can vote on proposals and compensation requests, and BSQ can be used to pay trading fees at a discounted rate. **...** *(the FAQ continues with more sections on contributing, the DAO, etc.)*", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Bisq 2", "content": "Bisq 2 is the successor to the original Bisq ([[Bisq 1|Bisq v1]]). It has been developed from the ground up to allow for multiple trade protocols to be accessed via a single decentralized exchange platform. At the initial launch of Bisq 2 will support only one trading protocol '[[Bisq Easy]]'. Over time more trading protocols will be added. Once the Bisq Multisig protocol is implemented in Bisq 2, the old version of Bisq can fade out. [[Bisq 1]] will still find its usage as Bisq DAO management tool and for BSQ-BTC trading. Similar to Bisq v1, Bisq 2 will be a decentralized bitcoin exchange that allows anyone to buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies. * Bisq 2 is a desktop application that works across platforms. * Bisq 2 allows users to choose between multiple trading protocols to find the best fit for their preference. Aspects like privacy and security, convenience, costs and trade duration will differ and the user can make the choice. * Bisq 2 is a peer-to-peer network that enables users to find people to trade with, make and take offers to buy and sell bitcoin, communicate with their trading peers and when necessary access support. * Bisq 2 is privacy focused, no verified accounts or KYC will be required and run over the Tor network (as well as I2P in future). * Bisq 2 is self custodial. Your keys are always under your control. * Bisq 2 is open source (AGPL) and built and maintained by contributors who form the Bisq DAO. == Why Bisq 2? == Bisq v1 is a powerful tool for bitcoiners that want to be able to buy and sell bitcoin peer to peer whilst maintaining their privacy, not having to undergo arduous KYC processes, and keeping control of their bitcoin. Bisq v1 was launched on mainnet in April 2016 and whilst there has been constant improvements to the trade protocol and user interface over the years it was designed from the outset to support only one trade protocol. As bitcoin has developed and Bisq user base has grown there has been an obvious need for Bisq to expand its offerings to offer more options to its users for example trades over lightning and access via mobile devices. Bisq 2 is the first step to develop something that is built from the ground up to be more accessible to users and provide access to multiple trading protocols that can expand over time. The core benefits of Bisq 2 are: === Multiple Trade Protocols === Bisq 2 will offer a variety of [[trade protocols]] for users. Each trade protocol will come with its own benefits and tradeoffs. Having multiple protocols allows users to choose what trade protocols are best for them based on; convenience, security, miner costs, trade fees, privacy, available support etc. All trade protocols can be accessed independently and users can switch between protocols for different trades. The follow trade protocols are on the roadmap: * [[Bisq_Easy|Bisq Easy]]: Reputation based trading with no security deposit requirements (included in the initial launch) * Bisq Multisig: Similar to the current trade protocol used by Bisq 1 but with some improvements * Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC <-> mainnet BTC * Liquid Submarine Swaps: Atomic swap of LN BTC <-> Liquid BTC * Liquid Multisig: Bisq Multisig ported to Liquid network with faster confirmation, lower fees and better privacy (confidential transactions) * Bisq Lightning: LN BTC <-> Fiat (chain of multiple protocols: Liquid Submarine Swaps, Liquid Multisig) * Liquid Swaps: Atomic swap of Liquid BTC <-> Liquid assets like L-USDT * BSQ Swaps: Atomic swap of BSQ <-> BTC * Monero Swaps: Cross chain atomic swap of BTC <-> XMR Find out more about the [[Trade_Protocols|trade protocols]] Bisq 2 will use. === Multiple privacy networks === Bisq 2 will support multiple privacy networks. Initially it will only support Tor but I2P support is already implemented but in an experimental state. Upcoming privacy networks like Nym could be added in future if they fit the requirements. Having multiple networks adds resilience in case one network has availability issues (as it happened multiple times with Tor when DoS attacks decreased the Tor network stability and with that Bisq's availability and stability). The P2P network has also a built in DoS protection using Proof of Work and comes with many improvements compared to the Bisq 1 P2P network. === Multiple Identities === Bisq 1 used a single onion address and key pair which represent the user's identity. Bisq 2 will allow users to create multiple identities, giving the user more control and better privacy. The user can choose between the highest level of convenience and use just one global identity for all interactions (like Bisq 1) or at the other extreme use a separate identity for each trade as well as for each chat room). And anything in between (separating fiat and altcoin trades,...). Find out more about how Bisq 2 manages [[Identity|identities]]. === Multiple applications === The reference implementation will be the Bisq 2 JavaFx desktop application. But there is also ongoing work on a HTML interface with a headless application to be used on personal Node projects like Start9, Umbrel, MyNode,... Beside that there will be a REST API (useful for trading bots,...). Bisq Easy can be implemented as a mobile app (at least for Android there are no conceptual or technical hurdles). === Multiple wallets === At launch time Bisq 2 will not include a wallet, but work is underway to support multiple wallet options. Bitcoin core as a full wallet is already implemented (but not exposed in the UI). For users who do not want to run a full Bitcoin node, there will be a light wallet option. Currently Electrum is implemented but we might change to another solution. For the different trade protocols there will be the specific wallets required. E.g. for Liquid the Elements wallet is already integrated. For Monero Swaps we need to provide an interface for using the Monero wallet. Find out more about the [[Bisq_2_Wallet|Bisq 2 wallet]]. === Bonded Roles === The contributors providing the resources and infrastructure for Bisq 2 will require their roles to be bonded. This concept was also used in Bisq 1 but as it was not strictly enforced by the system, not all roles are secured by bonds as it was envisioned. In Bisq 2 having set up a BSQ bond is mandatory for most roles and node operators and enforced by the system. Find out more about the [[Bisq_2_Roles|Bisq 2 roles]]. == Bisq 1 vs Bisq 2 == When Bisq 2 is launched it will initially only use the one trade protocol '[[Bisq Easy]]' therefore the differences are based on a 2-of-2 multisig protocol (Bisq 1) vs a reputation based trade protocol (Bisq Easy). == Bisq Easy == Bisq Easy was designed for new Bitcoin users who have not yet purchased Bitcoin and therefore cannot use Bisq 1 due the requirements of the security deposit. A lot of effort was put into making it as simple to use as possible. Bisq Easy tries to replicate the experience of a novice Bitcoiner visiting a Bitcoin meetup and getting a gentle and friendly introduction into the Bitcoin world as well as the opportunity to purchase their first Bitcoin from a helpful peer. The seller is expected to be an experienced Bitcoin and Bisq user and to have built up a reputation. The seller should be helpful and serve as guide through the newbie's first Bitcoin trade. Bisq Easy tries to be a much more social experience as it is the case on Bisq 2. It also provides a \"learn\" section where newbies can learn about important topics like wallets, privacy and security. The various sections for chat rooms should also boost the social and communicative aspect of Bisq Easy. === Main differences for BTC buyers === Initially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow for users to buy bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no miner fees. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to buy bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs. The tradeoff for Bisq 2 is that the security of the trade will be based on seller reputation as opposed to Bisq 1 where the security of the trade is based on bitcoin collateral secured in the multisig. Therefore, Bisq 2 will be cheaper and more convenient to trade for bitcoin buyers but at the cost of less robust security than Bisq 1. This is opposed to Bisq 1 that will be more secure but also more expensive, in terms of trade and miner fees, and less convenient for bitcoin buyers. Bisq 2 will initially be more suitable for users wanting to complete trades for small amounts of bitcoin, whereas, Bisq 1 will continue to be suitable for users wanting to complete trades for larger amounts of bitcoin. === Main differences for BTC sellers === Initially when Bisq 2 is launched the difference between versions will be that Bisq 2 will allow users to sell bitcoin with no security deposit, no trade fees and no security deposit. Whereas, Bisq 1 will allow users to sell bitcoin with a security deposit and incur trade fees and miner costs. Sellers on Bisq 2 will be expected to build their reputation. This can be done in multiple ways but to achieve a high reputation they will need to either burn BSQ and / or create a BSQ bond that locks in a specific amount of BSQ for a specified length of time. The first iteration of Bisq 2 will have more buyers than sellers. That means a small number of sellers will be servicing the buyers. Bitcoin sellers on Bisq 2 will be required to make a judgement on how best to achieve their reputation and what the cost of doing so will involve. Bitcoin seller's using Bisq 2 will also need to account for the fact that bitcoin buyers are not putting down a security deposit for their trades so there will likely be a higher trade abandonment than in Bisq 1. It is expected that some bitcoin sellers currently active on Bisq 1 may choose to experiment with Bisq 2, and the number of buyers and sellers on Bisq 2 will grow over time. As in Bisq 1 seller's will be able to choose the price above or below market they wish to sell their bitcoin for. Due to the requirements on bonds and the potential higher effort on communication with a newbie Bitcoiner, the price premium can be expected to be much higher than in Bisq 1 (maybe 10-15% above market). The Seller is the one who sets the price. == How Bisq 2 keeps data private == Bisq 2 achieves data privacy for users in the same way as Bisq 1: * Using Bisq requires no registration or centralized identity verification * Every Bisq application connects to the Bisq network with a Tor hidden service (as well as I2P in future) * Bisq has no central servers or databases to record data * Data is encrypted such that trade details are readable only by counter-parties == How Bisq 2 resists censorship == Bisq 2 achieves censorship resistance in the same way as Bisq 1: * Bisq’s network is a fully distributed P2P network, and thus difficult to shut down * Bisq’s network is built on top of Tor (I2P), and thus inherits Tor’s own censorship resistance * Bisq is an open source project and a DAO, not a company; it is not incorporated, and thus cannot be disincorporated == Advanced configurations for Bisq 2 == For users that want to tinker with the default config setting. Bisq 2 supports users to add a config file in the data directory which overrides the default config. This can be useful instead of dealing with command line options. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file. For more info see the GitHub pull request [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/pull/2201 here]. == Installation == === Download and verify === Bisq2 can be downloaded [https://bisq.network/downloads/ here]. Before installing software that manages your funds, you should always verify the installer has not been tampered with, to avoid the risk of losing funds due to a compromised download. To import the key in Linux and MacOS: `curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/E222AA02.asc | gpg --import` GPG will return \"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\", this is normal (see https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means) To verify the installer against the signature: `gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}` Replace BINARY with the name of the file you downloaded. In Windows you can import the key, and subsequently verify the installer, by using [https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html Kleopatra]. === Known issues with installation === '''MacOS''' Notarization was removed from the build pipeline because of the risk of Apple certification revocation ([https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/discussions/6341 GitHub issue]). Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS. Please follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section \"If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer\". If you are using macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to execute the following in your terminal to be able to start Bisq 2: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq2.app` You will be prompted to enter your password to execute the command as super user, and this should allow you to start Bisq 2 normally. '''Windows''' The developer code signing was removed for the same reason as above. You can ignore the warning after having verified the installer. There are known issues with antivirus software: Bisq or Tor processes could be prevented from running, files could get deleted in the data directory [2] or the application directory [1]), or startup could be delayed to the point that Tor is terminated, and a lockfile is left behind preventing Bisq from being started again (this requires you to restart Windows in order to remove the lockfile). These issues are currently being evaluated and addressed. Windows suffers from a much wider attack surface compared to Linux or OSX, please consider using a different operating system when dealing with cryptocurrencies. [1] Application directory (contains application installation files): C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Bisq2 [2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data): C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bisq2 '''Linux''' Debian users: if you have issues starting Bisq, run `/opt/bisq2/bin/Bisq2` If your Linux distribution does not support .deb files please follow these instructions: ` cd ~/Downloads ` `mkdir tmp ` `cd tmp ` `ar x ../Bisq-64bit-2.1.2.deb ` `sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz ` `sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq2 /opt/ ` The above is not tested in all distributions, if you encounter issues please report them [https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/issues here].", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Bisq Easy", "content": "Bisq Easy is a trade protocol for Bisq 2, designed to facilitate the acquisition of bitcoin with zero trade fees and without the requirement of a security deposit. Bisq Easy is a social trade protocol intended for novice bitcoin buyers seeking a non-KYC option and aiming to be efficiently onboarded by experienced and knowledgeable sellers that are familiar with the Bisq platform. Bisq Easy is currently the only trade protocol for [[Bisq 2]]. More [[Trade_Protocols|trade protocols]] are planned for the future. == Bisq Easy Trade Protocol Specifics == === Trade fees === There are no trade fees for buyers or sellers for trading on Bisq Easy. === Mining fees === Buyers will not have to pay any mining fees when they trade on Bisq Easy. Sellers will need to pay any fees required to send the bitcoin to the buyer after receiving their payment. For on-chain transactions the seller is responsible for paying mining fees needed to send the bitcoin to the buyer's wallet. For lightning transactions the seller is responsible for paying any routing fees needed to pay the buyer's LN invoice. === Security mechanisms === The security of the trade is proportional to the reputation of the seller. As Bisq Easy is [[reputation based]], and reputation provides a fairly low security model, it means traders on Bisq Easy are suited only to rather small amounts of bitcoin. By default buyers can only exchange messages with sellers that have a certain level of reputation, however, buyers can opt-out from that protection. Trading with sellers without reputation, or very low reputation, carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed. === Currencies / Payment Methods === Bisq Easy buyers and sellers can trade bitcoin for any type of fiat. Fiat buyers and sellers can choose whatever type of payment method they agree upon for fiat transfer. === Dispute mechanisms === Buyers and sellers trading on Bisq Easy can access mediation support should anything go wrong with their trade. Mediators will be able to: * Help facilitate the successful completion of the trade * Confirm fiat / altcoin and bitcoin payments * Help cancel trade if needed * Report a trader who severely violated the trade rules to the moderator who can ban the user. Depending on the form of reputation used, a fraudulent seller can get their bonded BSQ confiscated by the DAO or their Bisq 1 onion address banned. As all reputation is linked to the user profile, a banned user profile disables their reputation. === Security deposit requirements === Bisq Easy trades do not require any security deposits from either the buyer or seller. === Privacy benefits / trade-offs === As no security deposits are required, buyers and sellers using fiat will be revealing their bank account details to users that might end up backing out of the trade. If a user backs out of a trade there is less possibility to penalize them than if they had to trade using a security deposit. The seller can report a buyer who cancelled the trade after the payment account data has been transmitted to the moderator, who can ban the buyer. == Identity == Buyers and sellers on Bisq Easy can create multiple identities. Find out more about managing your [[Identity]] on Bisq 2. == Reputation == The security mechanism of Bisq Easy is based on the reputation of the seller. Buyers on Bisq Easy do not need to have a reputation as they will always send the payment first. Find out more about [[Reputation]] for Bisq Easy. == Using Bisq Easy to buy bitcoin == Users of Bisq Easy can buy bitcoin using fiat or altcoins with no fees and no security deposits. == Using Bisq Easy to sell bitcoin == Users of Bisq Easy can sell bitcoin for fiat or altcoins with no fees and no security deposits. Sellers of Bisq Easy will however have to build up their [[reputation]] in order to get buyers. == How to buy bitcoin on Bisq Easy == Buying Bitcoin with Bisq Easy is recommended for small fiat amounts, or as a starting point if you still have no Bitcoin that you can use for the security deposits of other trade protocols. You can opt for two ways to find a trading partner to get some Bitcoin: taking an existing offer or creating one. === Creating an offer === Creating an offer is a great way to establish your own terms and simply wait for someone to match what you are after. It is also the right option if you don't find any offers with the right premium or payment methods in the market you want to trade in. Follow along to learn how to navigate to your preferred market and create a new offer in it: Begin by opening up Bisq 2. Once the application has started, you should select ''Bisq Easy'' on the left panel, and ''Offerbook'' on the top tab. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 1.png|frameless]] Each different national currency has its own market. You can click on the displayed pair to open a selector where you can choose the currency you would like to trade in. In this example, we are interested in buying some Bitcoin by paying with Euros, so we will select the ''BTC/EUR'' pair, but you should select whatever currency you are using. Afterward, click on the ''Create offer'' button on the right-hand side. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 2.png|frameless]] You will now enter the offer creation wizard. The first step will be to choose between buying or selling Bitcoin. Select ''Buy Bitcoin'' and click on ''Next''. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 3.png|frameless]] On the following screen, you will be asked for confirmation on which currency you want to pay your Bitcoin with. The selected currency will be the one you selected in the previous ''Offerbook'' screen. You can change your mind here if needed. Since for this example we want to buy Bitcoin with Euros, we proceed. Click ''Next''. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 4.png|frameless]] Next, enter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to buy. For beginners or small amounts, you might start with a small amount like 0.005 BTC to test things out. Click ''Next''. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 5.png|frameless]] Choose the payment account you want to use to pay the seller. If you haven’t added a payment account yet, you’ll need to create one (for example, a SEPA bank account, Revolut account, etc. – whatever method you plan to use). After selecting the account, click ''Next''. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 6.png|frameless]] Now set the price. You can set a percentage above or below the market price. For example, a seller might want to sell at 2% above market (to cover their costs or make a profit). If you’re creating a buy offer, you might set a percentage below market to indicate how much under market price you’re willing to pay. In this example, since you are buying BTC, a negative percentage means a discount off market price (which is unlikely to attract a seller), whereas a positive percentage means you’re willing to pay more than market (which could attract sellers faster). Set your price and click ''Next''. [[File:Create buy offers screenshot 7.png|frameless]] Review the offer details and click ''Create offer'' to publish it. Your offer will now appear in the Bisq Easy offer book for others to take. === Taking an offer === Taking an existing offer is simpler: you just choose from the list of available offers on Bisq Easy. Go to the Bisq Easy > Offerbook screen, select your fiat currency market (e.g., BTC/EUR), and look at the list of offers. If you see one that suits the amount and price you’re willing to pay, click it and then click ''Take offer''. You will need to have an appropriate payment account added that matches the offer’s payment method. Once you take the offer, you’ll get the counterparty’s payment details to pay them (if you’re the buyer) or they’ll see yours (if you’re the seller). Complete the payment as instructed and wait for the seller to confirm and release BTC. == After the trade == Once a Bisq Easy trade is completed: * **Reputation update:** The seller’s reputation will update (increase) according to the trade amount. Buyers do not gain reputation since they always pay first. * **Feedback:** It’s good practice for both parties to leave feedback via the Bisq chat on how the trade went, especially since this is a social protocol. * **Next steps:** Buyers who acquired BTC can now consider moving to Bisq v1 trades (with deposits) for larger amounts, or continue with Bisq Easy for small amounts. Sellers can use their gained reputation to attract more buyers for future offers. Bisq Easy is meant as a stepping stone for new users and a convenient, feeless option for small trades – but it relies heavily on reputation and trust between traders, in contrast to Bisq’s traditional multisig-secured approach.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Identity", "content": "Bisq 2 users are able to manage multiple identities for their trades. At Bisq 2 launch in March 2024, the identities feature provides flexibility in how users present themselves on the network. __TOC__ == What are Identities in Bisq 2 == Identities in Bisq 2 allow users to create distinct profiles (keys) that they use when trading or chatting. In Bisq v1, each user essentially had one identity tied to their onion address. In Bisq 2, you can create and use multiple separate identities. Identities are essentially keypairs (with associated onion addresses) that represent you in the Bisq network. Each identity has its own reputation, payment accounts, and trade history. You can think of identities like different accounts or personas, although all are managed within your single Bisq app. == Why use multiple identities == **Privacy:** Using different identities for different purposes can enhance privacy. For example, you might use one identity for trades in fiat markets and another for trades in crypto markets, so it’s harder for someone to link all your trading activity together. You could also use distinct identities for each trade partner or for each group of trades. **Security through compartmentalization:** If one identity’s information is compromised or banned (in case of a dispute or rule violation), your other identities remain unaffected. **Testing vs. real trading:** You might have a test identity for experimenting and another identity for serious trading. **Reset reputation:** If you wanted to “start over” without any reputation (or with a clean slate for some reason), you could create a new identity. == How to create and manage identities == In Bisq 2, the identities management is typically found under a section like `Account > Identities` or `User Options > Identities`. You can: * **Create a new identity:** Generate a new identity keypair. You may be prompted to label it for your reference (e.g., “Altcoin trades identity”). The app will create a new onion address for it in the background. * **Switch active identity:** Choose which identity you want to use for new offers or trades. For example, when you create a new offer, you might have a drop-down to pick which identity will be the one trading. * **Import identity (optional):** If you had an identity from another device or backup, you might import it (requires the key data). * **Export identity:** For backup purposes, you might export an identity’s keys to a file or print them (to be stored securely). Each identity has its own profile info. This may include: * **Reputation score:** if reputation is used (like in Bisq Easy), each identity will have its own reputation. * **Account age:** some trade protocols might track how long an identity has existed on the network. * **Onion address:** the network address representing that identity. * **Bond status:** if any roles (like mediator or other bonded roles) are tied to an identity, that will be specific to it. == Using identities in trades == When you take an offer or create an offer, your chosen identity’s details are used. Counterparties see only the identity you used, not any others. For example, if Bob has Identity A and Identity B, and he creates an offer with Identity A, traders who interact with that offer will only know about Identity A (onion address, reputation, etc.). If Bob later trades using Identity B, those are effectively separate from the perspective of other traders. **Note:** Identities are not visible like usernames; they are essentially just keys. But reputation systems or other indicators in the UI will be tied to the identity key. == Reputation and identities == Since Bisq 2’s Bisq Easy protocol uses reputation, it’s important to note: each identity accrues reputation separately. If you build a high reputation on one identity and then switch to a new identity, the new one starts from scratch. This is a trade-off: more privacy (harder to correlate identities) vs. convenience (establishing reputation). Users can decide whether to stick to one identity to maximize reputation or use several to compartmentalize activity. Some might use one identity to gain reputation (for selling BTC, for instance) but keep another for buying. == Best practices == * **Keep identities truly separate:** Avoid linking them through information in chats or payment details. If you use one identity with a specific bank account and another identity with a different bank account, you’re better partitioned. Using the same bank account on two identities would link them (to the counterparty). * **Don’t overdo it:** You probably don’t need a unique identity for every single trade (unless you want extreme privacy). Managing too many could become cumbersome. Many users might settle on a couple of identities for different contexts. * **Backup identities:** If you create multiple identities, **back them all up** (including their keys or seeds) in case you need to restore your Bisq data. Each identity’s keys are typically part of the overall application backup, but double-check how Bisq 2 handles this. * **Identity names:** Use clear labels for yourself in the UI so you don’t confuse them (like \"MainIdentity\" vs \"AltIdentity\"). Note that these labels are internal and not shared. * **Watch out for cross-identity issues:** If you have open offers or trades under one identity, be careful when switching. Ensure you don’t accidentally abandon a trade under Identity A by switching focus to Identity B – Bisq should handle it, but you need to remember which identity has which ongoing trades. == Summary == Multiple identities in Bisq 2 give users more flexibility and privacy. They are a powerful feature especially in a reputation-based system, as they let you decide how to balance building reputation versus keeping activities separate. Over time, we might see common patterns (e.g., one identity per market, or one for buying vs one for selling). It’s an advanced feature; new users can ignore it and just use the default single identity if they prefer simplicity.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Bisq 2 Wallet", "content": "Bisq 1 uses [https://bitcoinj.org/ bitcoinj] for its bitcoin wallet implementation. It is not 100% decided yet which wallet we will use (currently Electrum and Bitcoin Core are being evaluated). Initially Bisq 2 will launch without an integrated Bitcoin wallet – users will need to connect an external wallet or use one of the provided options. However, the design is modular to allow different wallet backends. __TOC__ == No built-in wallet at launch == To get Bisq 2 released faster and allow flexibility, the initial version of Bisq 2 does not have its own native Bitcoin wallet like Bisq v1 did. This means: * Users must have their own Bitcoin wallet outside Bisq 2 to hold and manage their BTC. * When a trade is executed, Bisq 2 will interface with the user’s chosen wallet to fund trades and receive BTC. * This approach lets advanced users choose wallets that fit their needs (full node, SPV, etc.), but it may add complexity for newer users. The plan is to add an integrated wallet in Bisq 2 later, but with an improved design over bitcoinj. Possible options include using Bitcoin Core’s wallet or a simplified SPV wallet that can work with external nodes. == Planned wallet options == Bisq 2 is designed to potentially support multiple wallet backends: * **Bitcoin Core (Full Node)** – There is work to allow Bisq 2 to use a locally running Bitcoin Core node’s wallet. This would mean if a user runs Bitcoin Core, Bisq can create addresses and transactions via RPC. This ensures a fully validating, highly secure wallet (but requires running a full node). * **Electrum** – Another possibility is to integrate with Electrum servers or use an SPV mode like Electrum. Bisq 2 could have an SPV wallet that connects to either public Electrum servers or a user’s own Electrum server for lightweight operation. * **External wallet via PSBT** – Advanced option: Bisq 2 could export PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) that the user signs with an external wallet (like hardware wallet). This adds security (keys don’t live in Bisq at all) but is more technical. * **Internal SPV wallet** – A new built-in SPV wallet might be created for Bisq 2 (using a modern library or implementation) to eventually replace bitcoinj but still allow a simple out-of-the-box experience. Initially though, devs opted not to delay launch with this. * **Lightning wallets (future)** – If Bisq 2 adds support for Lightning or Liquid trades, separate wallet handling for those (integrations with Lightning nodes, etc.) will be included. The architecture is being built to accommodate those. == User experience at launch == At the Bisq 2 launch, the user experience around the wallet might be: * On first run, Bisq 2 asks the user to choose a wallet mode: **Connect to Bitcoin Core** (if detected) or **Use external wallet**. * If connecting to Core, it might prompt for RPC credentials (or auto-detect local node) and perhaps use a specific wallet (e.g., it might use Core’s default wallet or create a new one via RPC). * If using external, Bisq might provide an address for multisig funding that the user must fund manually for each trade. For example, when taking an offer, Bisq could generate a deposit address and ask the user to send the required funds from their personal wallet to that address. * Bisq 2 then waits for confirmation that funds have arrived to proceed with the trade. * For outgoing payments (like releasing BTC to the buyer), Bisq 2 would construct a transaction and possibly either have the user sign it externally or sign via Core RPC. * This process will likely be smoothed out quickly post-launch, but it could be a bit less seamless compared to Bisq v1 initially. == Security considerations == Without a built-in wallet, private keys aren’t stored in Bisq 2 (except maybe if connecting to Core where keys are in Core). That means less risk if Bisq 2 software has a bug – your keys are elsewhere. However, it puts more responsibility on the user to use a wallet correctly. The trade contract and deposit still use multisig, so Bisq 2 will still generate keys for the multisig escrow addresses per trade. Those keys need to be managed – likely Bisq 2 will have an internal keypool for multisig escrow purposes, even if it doesn’t hold a general balance. So, backing up Bisq 2 data (for those escrow keys) remains important. BSQ wallet: BSQ in Bisq 1 was just colored BTC managed in the same wallet. In Bisq 2, BSQ transactions (for fees/governance) might also rely on an external wallet or a simple internal mechanism. Possibly BSQ will be managed via the same connected Bitcoin Core wallet (colored output tracking). This detail is still TBD (to be decided). == Future developments == The Bisq developers intend to integrate a proper wallet in Bisq 2 after launch, possibly by: * Adopting an SPV library or writing a new one. * Or leveraging Bitcoin Core as the primary wallet and bundling Core in some form (or requiring users to install it). They will also consider user feedback: if newbies struggle with external wallets, a built-in solution will become high priority. Conversely, if many users prefer using their own wallets, the design might continue to accommodate that flexibility. As Bisq 2 adds support for more protocols (like trades over Lightning or Liquid), wallet integration for those (like an LND or CLN for Lightning, Elements for Liquid) will be added. The wallet in Bisq 2 aims to be more modular and maintainable than Bisq 1’s bitcoinj. This should make it easier to upgrade, patch, or swap out components as needed. == Summary == Bisq 2’s wallet strategy is initially to **not include a full native wallet** to speed up development and encourage use of external wallets, then gradually introduce integrated wallet functionality. Users at launch should be prepared to manage their BTC with an external wallet or connect to their node. Over time, expect Bisq 2 to gain a first-class wallet experience either via Core integration or a new built-in wallet, providing both convenience for newcomers and flexibility for power users.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Bisq 2 Roles", "content": "Bisq 2 has contributors that take responsibility for specific bonded roles for the network resources and processes. There are 2 types of bonded roles. * **System roles** – Roles that must be performed by a designated contributor and cannot be delegated, due to their security-critical nature. * **Delegable roles** – Roles that are performed by contributors but could potentially be run by multiple parties or delegated, since they don’t require singular control. __TOC__ == System roles == System roles for Bisq 2 have to be carried out by the authorized contributor. They cannot be delegated to anyone else in order to maintain the security of Bisq. These roles typically have high trust and require a BSQ bond locked in the DAO to assume. The Bisq 2 system roles include: ### Mediator Mediators help users of the Bisq Easy trade protocol if issues arise during trades. They monitor disputes and guide traders to resolution, but unlike Bisq v1 arbitrators, **mediators cannot move funds** – they only suggest solutions. They have no control over user funds or binding authority; their role is advisory. If a trader in Bisq Easy is behaving poorly (e.g. attempting to scam), mediators can escalate information to moderators to potentially ban the offending user. A mediator role is bonded (they lock up BSQ as collateral). If they misbehave, their bond can be confiscated via DAO vote. Mediators are expected to be responsive and impartial. ### Moderator Moderators ensure smooth running of Bisq Easy by handling rule enforcement. They monitor the network (offers, chats) for spam or abuse. They can ban users’ profile IDs who severely or repeatedly violate trade rules. They rely on reports from mediators and users. Moderators have a bonded role as well. Banning in Bisq 2 (for Bisq Easy) is not very potent (since users can create new identities easily), but it adds friction for bad actors. Moderators also coordinate with other roles in case of emergencies (e.g., widespread scams). ### Security Manager The Security Manager in Bisq 2 is akin to the filter operator in Bisq 1. This role can publish data to block certain trades or users on the network (e.g., blocking a stolen bank account from being used, or halting trades of a certain payment method if a security issue arises). The Security Manager’s actions are limited by the software (users can opt-out of security filters, though it’s not recommended). This role is also bonded and has the responsibility to react to critical incidents (like alerting users or temporarily pausing trading in extreme cases). They can broadcast network-wide alerts (info, warnings, emergency halts). ### Update Manager (Release Manager) The Update Manager broadcasts updates or alerts regarding new software versions to the network. For example, when a new Bisq 2 version is available or if a certain older version needs to be deprecated, the Update Manager sends notifications. This helps ensure users upgrade promptly. In some cases, the Update Manager can warn users running out-of-date software. This role might also be bonded, since misinformation here (like a false update alert) could be harmful. It’s essentially a trusted announcer for the network. (This role is somewhat analogous to the Step 2 in v1 where the DAO could block outdated versions, but now done by a role.) == Delegable roles == Delegable roles can potentially be run by multiple contributors and don’t require single-entity trust (though they still may have bonds to prevent abuse). In Bisq 2, delegable roles include: ### Seed node Seed nodes are servers that help bootstrap the P2P network. They provide initial peer lists to Bisq clients when connecting. In Bisq 2, seed nodes are bonded roles to ensure they are operated reliably and not maliciously. Multiple seed nodes can run (ideally in diverse jurisdictions). The role can be delegated in the sense that many contributors can host seed nodes as long as they meet requirements and bond BSQ. ### Oracle node Oracle nodes provide price data and other shared data (e.g., the BTC/USD price feed, or BSQ/BTC rate, or maybe the reputation scoring data). They might also publish the proof-of-burn info for Burning Man accounts, etc. Because the information oracles provide can affect trades (e.g., price feed for market price-based offers), they are bonded. Bisq 2 might have one primary oracle or several redundantly. Under Oracle node, there might be sub-services like: **DAO bridge service** – helps connect Bisq 2 to the Bisq DAO (for proposals/votes on BSQ). **Reputation service** – publishes aggregated reputation info (if needed), such as distributing lists of banned users or scores (though reputation is mostly local, some global view might be needed). **Time-stamping service** – perhaps to time-stamp certain events (to prevent replay attacks or to anchor data in the blockchain). Some of these might be separate roles or combined into one oracle node. ### Explorer nodes Explorer nodes could be services that index and provide data about offers, trades, etc., to make the network more efficient. Possibly similar to how v1 had seed nodes that also served as bitcoin nodes for SPV. In v2, an explorer node might provide APIs for market data or act as a query node for clients to get network info without scanning everything. They can be run by community (hence delegable). ### Market price node Possibly a specialized oracle focusing on providing market prices (BTC/fiat rates) from external sources to the Bisq network. This could be part of the Oracle node role or separate. It fetches prices from exchanges or APIs and provides them to Bisq for use in price-based offer logic. Delegable with bonding to ensure honest data. (In practice, likely integrated with Oracle node function.) == How does someone get to perform a bonded role in Bisq 2 == To take on one of these roles, a contributor typically must: 1. Announce their candidacy (perhaps via the DAO proposal system) and lock up the required BSQ bond. 2. Run the required infrastructure (server, etc.) with the proper configuration. 3. The network (via DAO or hardcoded keys) recognizes that contributor’s identity as the role holder. Some roles might be one-at-a-time (e.g., one Security Manager active at once), others can be multiple (multiple mediators). Bisq 2 likely has a discovery mechanism for these roles — for example, a list of active mediator identities is published, etc. If a role holder misbehaves, their bond can be confiscated through a DAO vote. The threshold for bonds and the process to replace a role holder is governed by the DAO. Over time, roles could rotate or be added/removed by updating the software and DAO governance. == BSQ bonding for roles/nodes == Each role has a specific BSQ bond requirement: * Mediator: (example) 10,000 BSQ bond. * Moderator: 20,000 BSQ. * Seed Node: 5,000 BSQ. * Oracle Node: 50,000 BSQ. * etc. These numbers can change via proposals. The bond is locked in a special BSQ transaction. If the contributor quits gracefully, they unlock their bond. If they act maliciously, a vote can confiscate (burn) their bond as penalty. Bonds ensure skin in the game — it would be expensive to attack a role (since you’d lose the bond). Also, the size of bonds roughly correlates to the importance of the role (bigger bond for more critical roles). == Confiscation of BSQ bond for roles/nodes == If a contributor in a role abuses their power or fails in duties (e.g., a seed node goes rogue and refuses connections, or a Security Manager tries to censor honest traders), a DAO proposal can be made to confiscate their bond. This requires evidence and a vote. If passed, the BSQ bond is burned, and the role is considered vacant so someone else can assume it. This mechanism replaces the need for trust in individuals with economic incentive and community oversight. It’s an approach to decentralize the control of key network functions while still keeping them reliable. In summary, Bisq 2’s roles are an evolution of the concept from Bisq 1’s operator roles, with heavier reliance on bonding and DAO oversight to decentralize responsibilities (like arbitration now split into mediator/moderator roles, etc.). It's a framework to keep Bisq 2 trust-minimized even as it introduces new features like reputation and social trading.", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Downloading and installing", "content": "To use Bisq, you must first '''[https://bisq.network/downloads/ download and install]''' it. Most exchanges are centralized exchanges running on servers controlled by the exchange. Bisq is different – it’s software you run on **your own computer** that connects to a peer-to-peer network of other Bisq users. This guide will help you get Bisq installed and running on your system. __TOC__ == System Requirements == Bisq is a lightweight application. Basic requirements: * Windows 8 or above, macOS 10.13 or above, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian or similar distro recommended). * ~400 MB of disk space for data directory (can grow over time with trade data). * At least 2 GB RAM. * Internet connection (Bisq uses about 50 MB of data per day when idle). * No need for GPU or special hardware. Bisq will run on modest hardware (even Raspberry Pi 4), though faster hardware improves startup time and overall performance. == Download Bisq == The official Bisq binaries can be downloaded from the [https://bisq.network/downloads/ Bisq website]. Downloads are provided for: * Windows (64-bit .exe) * macOS (.dmg) * Linux (64-bit .deb package, and a generic tarball) Make sure you download from the official site. Optionally, you can verify the PGP signatures and hashes of the binaries (the site provides a link to signatures and the key). This ensures the software wasn’t tampered with. (Advanced users: Bisq is open source, so you can also build from source.) == Install on Windows == 1. Run the downloaded `Bisq-<version>.exe` installer. 2. You may get a SmartScreen warning since Bisq isn’t code-signed. Click \"More info\" then \"Run anyway\" (assuming you verified the binary). 3. The installer will ask for administrator privileges to install in Program Files – grant if required. 4. Complete the installation steps. By default it installs to `C:\\Program Files\\Bisq` and creates a Start Menu shortcut. 5. After installation, launch Bisq from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut. The first launch might trigger Windows Firewall – allow Bisq network access (private networks at least). 6. Bisq will open and automatically connect to the P2P network via Tor. Proceed to initial setup (covered below). == Install on macOS == 1. Open the downloaded `Bisq-<version>.dmg`. 2. Drag the Bisq app into the Applications folder. 3. On first run, since Bisq is not signed by Apple, you might get a warning. To bypass: right-click (or control-click) on the Bisq app in Applications, then click \"Open\" in the context menu. In the dialog that appears, choose \"Open\". This only needs to be done once. 4. Bisq will launch. The first time, macOS may ask if you want to allow network connections for Bisq (confirm to allow). 5. Bisq connects over Tor by default; no additional setup needed. == Install on Linux == *Debian/Ubuntu (.deb):* 1. Install the .deb via your software center or `sudo dpkg -i Bisq-<version>.deb` followed by `sudo apt-get install -f` if needed to resolve dependencies. 2. This will install Bisq under `/opt/Bisq` and add a launcher shortcut. 3. Run Bisq from your desktop environment (it might appear under Internet category) or by executing `/opt/Bisq/Bisq` in a terminal. *Generic (tar.gz):* 1. Extract the tarball: `tar xvf Bisq-<version>.tar.gz`. 2. Inside you’ll find a `Bisq` binary. Run it from a terminal: `./Bisq`. (Make sure you have Java 11 or higher installed, since Bisq runs on JVM). Note: On some Linux setups, you might encounter issues with the bundled Tor or missing libs. Check Bisq’s documentation if so. If you’re using Qubes OS, see [[Running_Bisq_on_Qubes|Running Bisq on Qubes]] for special installation steps. If you’re on Tails, see [[Running_Bisq_on_Tails|Running Bisq on Tails]]. == Initial Setup == On first launch, Bisq will: * Create its data directory: By default in `~/.local/share/Bisq` (Linux), `~/Library/Application Support/Bisq` (macOS), or `%appdata%\\Bisq` (Windows). This contains the Bisq wallet, settings, log files, etc. * Connect to the Bisq network over Tor (it automatically runs a Tor hidden service for you). This may take a minute on first startup. You will see the Bisq DAO sync and other network info loading. * Display a startup wizard (for brand new users): The wizard will help set a password for your wallet (highly recommended), and explain security deposit and account creation basics. Follow the prompts to secure your Bisq with a wallet password. * You may also be prompted to set your local currency, and optionally to fund your wallet (though you can skip funding for now). After this, you’ll see the Bisq main screen. From here, typical next steps are: add a payment account (under Account > Payment Accounts) so you can trade, and perhaps customize settings like your local currency or theme. == OS-specific install notes == * **Windows portable mode:** If you want to run Bisq without an installer (e.g. off a USB stick), you can use the `.exe` binary in a portable way by creating a shortcut with the `--appDataDir=<path>` argument pointing to a folder on the USB. * **macOS notarization:** As of version 1.9.X, Bisq was not notarized by Apple (to avoid developer ID risks), hence the right-click Open is needed. Keep an eye on release notes; the procedure could change if Bisq gets notarized or uses a different distribution method. * **Linux dependencies:** Bisq comes with an embedded JRE, so you shouldn’t need Java installed separately if you use the .deb or tar. If Bisq fails to start, run it from terminal to see errors. Often missing `libgconf-2` or similar can cause issues on certain distros. Install those via your package manager. * **Command-line options:** Advanced users can run Bisq with `--help` to see options (e.g. specifying a custom data directory, using a tor control port, etc.). See [[Running_from_the_command_line]] for details. == Keeping Bisq up-to-date == Bisq will notify you of new versions (in the app UI). It’s important to update, especially if a release fixes a critical bug or security issue. Updating is as simple as downloading the new version and installing over the old (your data directory and settings are preserved). On Linux, if using the .deb, your package manager may handle updates if you added the Bisq repository. On Windows/macOS, just run the new installer/dmg. No need to uninstall first. It’s usually fine to install on top. If Bisq’s DAO has activated a drop of support for old versions, you may be forced to upgrade to continue trading. Always read the release notes for any special actions needed (like backing up or migrating data directory if ever required).", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Reputation", "content": "The security model of [[Bisq Easy]] (a [[Bisq 2]] trade protocol) is based on the seller's reputation. As the buyer needs to send the fiat payment first in the trade process, the seller needs to provide reputation so that the buyer can trust the seller to send the bitcoin. Buyers should look to choose sellers with a high reputation for their trades. Sellers should look at how to maximize their reputation to ensure they get more trades. From Bisq 2 version 2.1.1 the maximum recommended trade amount depends on the seller's reputation. The higher their reputation the higher the possible trade amount (up to a ceiling of the bitcoin amount equivalent to 600 USD). Version 2.1.1 also introduces a change in the reputation score calculation, so that burned BSQ and bonded BSQ get twice their value in the course of the first year. [[File:Reputation-section-new.png|400px|thumb|left|The reputation section can be found on the left hand menu in Bisq 2]] <br clear=all> == Reputation based trade limits == A seller can take offers up to the amount derived from their reputation score. The formula is: `Reputation score / 200 = max. trade amount in USD`. In other words, for each USD the seller needs 200 reputation points. A reputation score of 30000 enables trades up to 150 USD (converted to the chosen fiat currency). For small trade amounts of the value 25 USD and below, this restriction is lifted. This is motivated by the lower risk of such small amounts and to give users more flexibility. The reputation based trade limits means a buyer creating an offer can be sure the taker (seller) has an adequate reputation score. In case the offer allows amounts below 25 USD anyone with low or no reputation can take the offer. Makers who do not want to allow users with no reputation to be able to take their offer should create offers higher than 25 USD. A seller creating an offer will get shown the max amount which is covered by their reputation score. They still can create offers with higher amounts, but a taker will get displayed a warning about the potential risks. == Minimum and maximum trade amounts == Prior to v2.1.1 the minimum and maximum trade amounts were set to 0.0001 - 0.01 BTC. With v2.1.1 we use the fixed fiat amount (independent of Bitcoin price) of 6 USD - 600 USD (converted to the chosen currency). This avoids fluctuations in case of price volatility. [[File:Minimum-maximum-trade-amounts.png|400px|thumb|left|The minimum and maximum trade amounts for Bisq 2 Easy are between 6 USD and 600 USD or your chosen fiat equivalent]] <br clear=all> == Minimum required reputation score == Prior to v2.1.1 users could set a minimum required reputation score for sellers in the settings, or use the recommended default value (30000). This has been removed in v2.1.1, as the amount-based approach is a better way to handle risk. [[File:Minimum-required-reputation-score.png|400px|thumb|left|Bisq will give you a warning if you try and trade with a user with less than the required reputation score.]] <br clear=all> == Transition and backward compatibility with prior versions == As long as there are users who run versions prior to v2.1.1, we need to deal with some backward compatibility cases. An offer created by a version prior to 2.1.1 can be taken by users of v2.1.1 up to 25 USD even if the reputation score is insufficient, as we have relaxed requirements for such relatively small amounts. In case a maker who had set the min. required reputation score to a higher level than the taker of the offer has, that maker can reject that trade without risking penalty. The mediator can assist in such a case to clarify and cancel the trade if needed. Buy offers created with v2.1.1 have set the min. required reputation score to 30000 regardless of any user setting (as that setting has been removed). Thus, sellers still using a version lower than 2.1.1 need to have at least 30000 reputation score to take those buy offers. == Reputation score star system == To make it easier for users to compare the reputation scores of different traders, Bisq displays reputation scores as stars (0–5 stars). The scores are relative: Bisq 2 collects all reputation scores of active users and normalizes them. The highest reputation user gets 5 stars, the lowest gets 0 stars, others are in between. If a high-reputation user leaves (is inactive for 2+ weeks, so their profile drops off the network), the scale adjusts (so someone else might now be the top 5-star). The idea is to provide a quick visual cue of a seller's reputation strength. [[File:Reputation-ranking-new.png|400px|thumb|left|Bisq converts a seller's reputation score into an easy-to-view star system. This makes it easy for buyers to see at a glance which sellers are most reputable (5 stars) versus new/low rep sellers (0–1 stars).]] <br clear=all> == Why is Reputation important for sellers == Bitcoin buyers send the fiat payment to the sellers prior to receiving the bitcoin. Therefore it is important for bitcoin sellers to have a good reputation to help establish trust with their potential trade partners. It is expected that users that want to gain reputation to be bitcoin sellers on Bisq Easy will be experienced Bisq users that can provide buyers with a positive experience. Selling bitcoin on Bisq Easy is expected to be profitable for the sellers in that they will likely choose to sell bitcoin **above market price** (i.e., at a premium) given the convenience to buyers. New buyers might be willing to pay a bit extra for their first BTC. So, sellers have an incentive (profit) to become reputable and serve that market. Additionally, a poor reputation (e.g., a seller who had a dispute or canceled trades frequently) will cause buyers to avoid them, so there is economic incentive to maintain a high reputation score. == How to build reputation == There are currently 4 options for creating reputation: * **Burning BSQ** – A seller can burn BSQ (the Bisq DAO token) to gain reputation. Burning BSQ is irreversible and gives a significant reputation boost (showing commitment). * **Setting up a BSQ bond** – A seller can post a BSQ bond (lock BSQ for a period of time). This also increases reputation. If the seller behaves badly, the bond can be confiscated by DAO vote. * **Importing the Account Age from Bisq 1** – If the user was a Bisq v1 trader, they had an account age witness. They can import that to Bisq 2 which grants some base reputation based on how long they’ve been trading on Bisq. * **Importing the Signed Account Age from Bisq 1** – If the user participated in the Bisq v1 account signing (a procedure where a trusted peer signs that you have a 2-month-old account to increase limits), that signed account age can also be imported to give a reputation boost. The total reputation score is the sum of all these contributions (and it can decrease over time for the time-based ones after a year as mentioned). Bisq Easy provides a UI under `Reputation` section where users can do all these actions: burn BSQ, bond BSQ, import account age proofs, etc., and see their total score. [[File:Reputation-section.png|frame|left|Bisq provides a dedicated section to manage and view your reputation, including options to burn or bond BSQ and import past account age proofs.]] <br clear=all> === Burning BSQ === A user who wants to improve their reputation on the Bisq Easy trade protocol can burn BSQ. The more BSQ that is burned the better the reputation score the user gets. The minimum amount of BSQ that can be burnt is 5.46 BSQ (dust limit). The reputation score achieved by burning BSQ increases linearly over the first twelve months. At the end of the 12 months the reputation score gained will be double what it was initially. This is to give an advantage to sellers over the long term. The value gained by burning BSQ persists over time (it doesn't decay or disappear, aside from the initial doubling period). Reputation scores achieved from burning BSQ are cumulative (burning more adds on). It can be assumed that regular burning (e.g. each week or month) is a form of demonstrating ongoing commitment and results in a higher reputation score. Data about the burned BSQ gets published automatically by the oracle node for others to verify. If a user gets banned by a moderator, they will lose the reputation value that they gained from burning BSQ (as the reputation is tied to their profile and a banned profile cannot be used anymore). **Follow these steps to burn BSQ for reputation:** # Select the user profile (identity) for which you want to attach the reputation. # Copy the \"profile ID\" (this is an identity’s public key or identifier). # Open Bisq 1 and go to \"DAO > Proof of Burn\" and paste the copied value into the \"pre-image\" field (this links the burn to your Bisq 2 identity). # Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn. # Publish the Burn BSQ transaction. # After blockchain confirmation, your reputation will become visible in your profile on Bisq 2 (it will fetch the proof from the DAO). On the Bisq 2 app, you will find this same information under 'User Options > Reputation' with guidance. [[File:Burning-bsq-reputation.png|frame|left|Bisq 2 provides guidance for burning BSQ to gain reputation. The more BSQ burned, the higher the reputation score (100 points per BSQ, doubling over 12 months).]] <br clear=all> <pre>Burning BSQ has the highest impact on the reputation score. For every 1 BSQ burnt, the user receives a reputation score of 100. This amount will increase linearly over the first twelve months until it doubles. For example, if a user burns 100 BSQ, their reputation score will be increased by 10,000 immediately, and by the end of the 12 months it will have increased to 20,000. Reputation obtained by burning persists with that user's profile (unless banned). To increase reputation further, a user can burn multiple times over time. The scores received are cumulative.</pre> === Setting up a BSQ bond === Similar to burning BSQ but using refundable BSQ bonds. BSQ needs to be bonded for a minimum of 50,000 blocks (about 1 year). During this time the BSQ is locked and unavailable to the user. After 50,000 blocks, the bond can be unlocked and the BSQ is returned to the user (assuming it wasn’t confiscated). The reputation score achieved by bonding BSQ also increases linearly over the first twelve months (doubling at the end of the period). This is to encourage long-term commitment. The value gained by bonding BSQ persists as long as the bond remains locked. If the bond is unlocked (after the minimum period), the reputation points from it would presumably be lost or reduced (since the user no longer has that bond up as collateral). Reputation scores from multiple bonds are cumulative. However, note that only one bond action might be allowed at a time per identity – user likely chooses an amount to bond and locks it. A bond can be confiscated (destroyed by a Bisq DAO vote) if the user was found scamming or breaking rules severely. This risk is relatively low for honest users but is a deterrent against scammers who might otherwise bond just to gain trust and then scam. Data about bonded BSQ is published automatically by the oracle node for transparency. **Follow these steps to bond BSQ for reputation:** # Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation (as with burn). # Copy the \"profile ID\". # Open Bisq 1 and go to \"DAO > Bonding > Bonded Reputation\" and paste the copied value into the \"salt\" field (this links the bond to your Bisq 2 identity). # Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lock up and the lock time (50000 blocks). # Publish the lockup (bond) transaction. # After blockchain confirmation, your reputation from the bond will become visible in your Bisq 2 profile. On the Bisq 2 app, this is also facilitated in the Reputation section UI. When the bond’s required time has passed, you could unlock it via a similar process (though likely via Bisq 1’s DAO interface or via a proposal). [[File:Bonding-bsq-screen.png|400px|thumb|left|The tool allows you to see the reputation score you would get from bonding BSQ. Bonding is similar to burning in its effect on score, but the BSQ is not lost unless you misbehave (then it can be confiscated).]] <br clear=all> === Importing Bisq 1 Account Age === If you have used Bisq v1, your payment account had an age based on first use. Bisq 2 can import an \"Account Age Witness\" from Bisq 1 to give some initial reputation credit. In Bisq 1, you can find your Account Age witness data (it might be automatically available via your seed, or by exporting account info). In Bisq 2, go to Reputation section and look for an option to \"Import Bisq 1 Account Age\". You might need to enter some code or simply have both Bisq 1 and Bisq 2 running and it can detect it. Each month of account age might correspond to some fixed reputation points (for example, maybe each month = 1000 points, up to X months). This helps long-time Bisq users carry over some trust. === Importing Bisq 1 Signed Account (Account signing) === Bisq 1 had a feature where users could get their account \"signed\" by a trusted peer after 2 months, which then lifted trading limits. If you had a signed account, Bisq 2 can recognize that. Likely during import, Bisq 2 will ask for your signed account information (the signature or some proof). Having a signed account in Bisq 1 likely gives a one-time reputation boost (perhaps equivalent to, say, burning 10 BSQ or similar). It signals you were a user who waited 2 months and someone vouched (signed) for you, which in Bisq 1 meant you didn’t scam anyone in that time. This is a smaller contributor to rep than burning or bonding, but not insignificant. Once imported, these account age and signing factors are added to your total reputation score. They do not increase over time (they are static), but they also do not expire (except if the profile is banned or reset). == What happens when a user profile ID is banned? == If a user profile ID is banned by a moderator (due to severe rule violations or scamming): * That profile’s reputation score is effectively nullified – it will no longer be considered in the network. The user cannot use that profile to trade or interact. * All the reputation associated with that profile (from burns, bonds, age, etc.) is lost, since the profile is disallowed. * The user could create a new profile, but they start from scratch with no reputation (and maybe now known to moderators if they try the same scam). Banning is not overly punitive in a sense that the user’s BSQ (if not confiscated separately) remains theirs, but since the profile is banned they lost any burned BSQ (because they burned it already) and any open bonds could be subject to confiscation via the DAO if the ban was for fraud. So banned users lose their burn investment and potentially their bond. The system relies on this deterrent: if a user has, say, burned BSQ to get 50k reputation and then scams, they lose that burn (since new profile will have 0 rep until they burn more) – expensive for them. Moderators only ban for serious reasons (e.g., clear fraud). Minor issues wouldn’t result in a ban, just mediation/arbitration outcomes. A banned profile’s onion address/key gets listed (so others know not to interact if it somehow appears). In Bisq 2, because identities are easy to create, banning is mostly a speed bump – but combined with lost rep it means the scammer’s effort and money is wasted and they have to start over (which hopefully discourages most attackers).", "category": "bisq2"}
{"title": "Running Bisq on Qubes", "content": "This guide shows '''how to run Bisq in a dedicated qube in QubesOS'''. The steps were tested using QubesOS 4.0.3 and a Bisq qube based on the <code>debian-10</code> template. __TOC__ == Overview == Running Bisq inside QubesOS provides an extra layer of isolation. QubesOS uses virtualization (Xen hypervisor) to compartmentalize applications into separate VMs (qubes). By putting Bisq in its own qube, you isolate it from your other activities, enhancing security. We'll create a dedicated Debian-based qube for Bisq and set it up appropriately. This guide assumes basic familiarity with QubesOS concepts like dom0, TemplateVMs, AppVMs, and the Qubes whonix-gateway (sys-whonix) if needed for Tor. == 1. How to setup == === 1.1 In dom0 === First, create a new AppVM for Bisq (this will be the isolated environment where Bisq runs): - In Qubes menu, open Qubes Settings or run `Qubes VM Manager`. - Click \"Create Qubes VM\". - Name it (e.g., `bisq-vm`). - Type: AppVM. - Template: choose `debian-10` (or debian-11 if available and you prefer). - Networking: (choose `sys-whonix` as the NetVM if you want all Bisq traffic over Tor by default, or `sys-firewall` if you prefer using Bisq's internal Tor; either works, but using sys-whonix is extra sure all traffic is Tor). - Check \"Launch settings after creation\" so we can adjust some things. Click OK. The qube will be created and Qubes VM Manager should show it. The Settings window opens: - On **Basic** tab: You can optionally increase Disk Storage if you plan to trade heavily (Bisq's data directory can grow with many trades). 5 GB is fine normally, but 10+ GB if you want extra. - On **Advanced** tab: Increase memory if needed (Bisq runs fine with 2GB, so set initial memory to 2000 MB). Also, optionally set VCPUs to 2 or 4 if you want Bisq to have more CPU cores. - Click OK to save settings. Now in dom0 terminal, we need to allow the Bisq VM to use the camera (for scanning QR codes if needed) or mic (for maybe future voice support) – but Bisq doesn't need those, skip. We do need to allow tor control if using sys-whonix? Actually if using sys-whonix as NetVM, that VM's Tor handles connections. Bisq normally runs its own Tor instance. Possibly simpler: use sys-firewall as NetVM and let Bisq's internal Tor connect directly. That should work because Qubes default `sys-firewall` will allow clearnet, but Bisq will open Tor circuits itself. If paranoid, using sys-whonix ensures even Bisq's initial network calls (like time sync) go through Tor. For now, assume sys-firewall approach. Also, we’ll need to bind some directories to persist data (since AppVM root is reset on boot, but home is persistent). But Bisq's data dir in `~/.local/share/Bisq` will persist automatically as it's in home. Actually, Qubes AppVMs are template-based: everything in /home is saved, yes. So we don't need special bind-dirs for Bisq data, but we *do* need to persist Bisq installation (since installing in `/opt` or such normally would vanish on restart). If we want to install Bisq only once, we should either: - Install it in the TemplateVM (not great for security, better keep it in AppVM). - Or use bind-dirs to persist /opt. This guide chooses to **bind directories** so Bisq remains installed across reboots of the AppVM. We'll bind /opt and /usr/share/desktop-directories to preserve Bisq installation and menu entry. In dom0, create bind dir config for the new VM: ``` sudo nano /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf ``` In that file, add lines: ``` binds+=( '/opt/bisq' ) binds+=( '/usr/share/desktop-directories' ) ``` Save and close. This tells Qubes to make /opt/bisq and the desktop menu persistent. Now shut down the bisq-vm if it's running, and start it again so the bind dirs take effect (or simply restart to apply). === 1.2 In dedicated qube (bisq-vm) === Open a terminal in bisq-vm (Qubes Manager: right-click bisq-vm > Xfce Terminal). We'll download and install Bisq: ``` sudo mkdir -p /opt/bisq ``` (the bind made /opt persistent, but ensure dir exists). Get Bisq .deb into the VM (using Qubes, either copy from dom0 or direct download): For security, verify signatures if possible. Quick method: inside bisq-vm terminal: ``` wget https://bisq.network/downloads/Bisq-<version>.deb ``` (replace <version> with latest). Or use the Qubes Downloads in Tor Browser in sys-whonix if no direct net. Once .deb is in bisq-vm, install it: ``` sudo dpkg -i Bisq-<version>.deb ``` If dpkg complains about missing dependencies, run: ``` sudo apt-get -f install ``` to fetch them (though Bisq .deb should bundle needed stuff). The Bisq app should now be installed to /opt/Bisq and a .desktop file placed in /usr/share/applications and /usr/share/desktop-directories. Because we bound /usr/share/desktop-directories, the menu should persist. Now test-run Bisq: In the bisq-vm terminal, run `Bisq`. (Or use Qubes menu: it might not show until you add it: Qubes Manager -> bisq-vm -> Refresh Applications, then add Bisq to favorites). Bisq should launch and connect to Tor. In Qubes, if using sys-firewall, Bisq opens its own Tor (it will just use clearnet to bootstrap Tor). If using sys-whonix as NetVM, Bisq might detect it's behind Tor already and possibly disable its internal Tor? But typically it will still run internal Tor but route through sys-whonix's Tor = Tor over Tor (should avoid that if possible by configuring Bisq to use system Tor). A simpler config: instruct Bisq to use Qubes' Tor (sys-whonix) as a proxy: In Bisq settings, set network to use `SOCKS5 proxy 10.137.0.6:9050` (the default Whonix gateway IP and Tor port for VMs). Then Bisq will not launch its internal Tor and instead use the proxy. This avoids Tor-in-Tor. After configuring, restart Bisq. It should connect quickly via the Whonix Tor. Now Bisq is running in an isolated VM. Proceed to set up Bisq (create wallet, password, etc.) as normal. All data is stored in `~/.local/share/Bisq` within bisq-vm and will persist (since /home persists). == 2. How to run == Once set up, daily usage is: - Start the `bisq-vm` AppVM (through Qubes start or Qube Manager). - Launch Bisq from Qubes menu (it might be under the bisq-vm's applications). - Use Bisq as normal. - When done, you can close Bisq and shut down the VM to save resources. If you ever update Bisq, you'd repeat the download + dpkg -i steps in the AppVM. Or consider updating the template or using Flatpak. But doing it in AppVM with bind dirs as above works fine. == Further reading == * QubesOS docs on [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/bind-dirs/ bind-dirs] for persistence. * Bisq Wiki on [[Running_Bisq_on_Tails|Running Bisq on Tails]] (similar isolation concept). * [https://bisq.community/t/running-bisq-in-qubes/ Support thread on Qubes forum] for troubleshooting specific issues (like VM clock sync or Tor access).", "category": "bisq1"}
{"title": "Capitual", "content": "'''Capitual''' is a payment method added in Bisq v1.7.2. Capitual is a payment service that combines fiat and crypto payments. Capitual is especially of benefit to users in Brazil and Europe due to integrations with PIX and SEPA, respectively. **Country**: Brazil (BR) and European countries (EU) primarily. **Currency**: BRL, EUR (and others supported by Capitual’s multi-currency accounts). **Payment interface**: Transfers within Capitual system, which can bridge to bank transfers. Capitual works by providing users with a multi-currency account. You can deposit funds via local methods (e.g., TED/Pix in Brazil, SEPA in EU) into Capitual, and then those funds can be transferred to other Capitual users instantly. For Bisq, a trade using Capitual would typically mean both traders use Capitual accounts to send fiat instantly. Because the transfer inside Capitual is just an internal ledger update, it's fast (near-instant) and can occur 24/7. **Registration**: Capitual requires sign-up with ID (it is a regulated platform). Not KYC-free. **Fee**: Capitual may charge small fees for deposits/withdrawals or currency conversion, but internal transfers might be free. **Bisq use**: When adding a Capitual account in Bisq, you provide: Capitual account email or username (the detail needed for someone to send you money within Capitual). The trade limit for Capitual initially was X (e.g., 0.25 BTC) like other new accounts, and signing not enabled because it's already KYC. **Considerations**: - **Speed**: Very fast, so payment window on Bisq might be set to 1 day or even a few hours. - **Reversibility**: If the underlying deposit was done via bank, there is some chargeback risk before it reaches Capitual. But once inside Capitual, sending is final between accounts (unless Capitual itself intervenes). - **Privacy**: Low, since Capitual can link your transactions and you are KYC’ed. But privacy towards the trading peer is okay (they only see your Capitual identifier). - **Usage**: To use this method, both trader and counterparty must have Capitual accounts. It’s somewhat niche given the KYC, but useful in regions where Capitual is popular. **Limits**: Bisq enforces the usual initial limit ~0.01 BTC for new accounts which grows. Also, note Capitual might have its own limits for unverified vs verified tiers. **Altcoins**: Capitual also supports crypto wallets; however, in Bisq context it's used purely for fiat transfer (not to send BTC).

It allows users to send and receive fiat or crypto via the Celsius app, focusing on simplicity. However, **as of mid-2022, Celsius has paused many operations due to financial issues, so CelPay availability is uncertain**. (Assuming the wiki was written before Celsius collapse.) **Country**: Global (Celsius was available in many countries, though not all). **Currency**: Various (likely USD or the user’s local currency, but the CelPay concept may have allowed stablecoins or crypto as intermediary). **Mechanism**: CelPay allowed you to send value to another user via a link or within the app instantly, funded by your Celsius account balance. For fiat trades on Bisq, CelPay would presumably be used to send fiat, but it might actually send crypto convertible to fiat? The wiki suggests it was used as a \"payment method\" presumably for fiat trades. Possibly they meant using stablecoins via CelPay. **Usage in Bisq**: When adding a CelPay account on Bisq, one might provide the identifier (email or phone number linked to CelPay). The buyer would then use the Celsius app to send funds to that identifier. Because CelPay transfers were instant within Celsius, the payment window was short. **KYC**: Celsius accounts require full KYC (so CelPay is not anonymous). **Trade limits**: Treated similar to other payments. Initially small limit until account is old. **Considerations**: - With Celsius's issues, using CelPay is risky or not possible as of now (the wiki page might be outdated). - If it were operational: Speed is near instant, 24/7. Reversibility: Once sent in app, can't reverse (except contacting Celsius support maybe). - Both parties need Celsius accounts. - Privacy: Low with respect to platform (Celsius sees everything), moderate between traders (they only see what info you share, likely just an email). In Bisq, CelPay likely didn't see widespread use due to the niche nature (it basically required trusting Celsius as an intermediary). **Current status**: CelPay was suspended when Celsius froze withdrawals. So as a Bisq payment method, it's likely deprecated. If you're a Bisq user, you probably should avoid CelPay now. On the wiki, the presence of CelPay was mostly for completeness when it was added. It demonstrates Bisq’s flexibility to add new fintech methods quickly.", "category": "bisq1"}
