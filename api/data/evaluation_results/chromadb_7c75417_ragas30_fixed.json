      "question": "Why can Bisq 2 overview show zero total buying/selling even when trades were completed?",
      "ground_truth": "Bisq 2 currently minimizes persistent historical stats for privacy by design; overview values may reflect limited current-profile/session context rather than full long-term trade history.",
      "answer": "In Bisq 2, if the overview shows zero total buying/selling even when trades were completed, it could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Reputation Requirements**: You cannot initiate trades with users who have a reputation of zero. If your trades were with such users, they would not be counted in the total overview.\n   \n2. **Pending Transactions**: If trades are still pending or not yet confirmed, they may not reflect in the total overview until they are finalized.\n\n3. **Interface Refresh**: Occasionally, the interface may not update in real-time. Refreshing the application can help show the latest trade data.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, consider checking your network connection or restarting the application.",

      "question": "Why can BSQ balance appear sufficient but trade-fee payment still fail in Bisq 1?",
      "ground_truth": "Fee payment requires spendable BSQ UTXOs and correct fee context (for example BSQ swap vs fiat-trade fee path). Stale wallet state or fragmented/unspendable outputs can trigger insufficient-balance errors.",
      "answer": "In Bisq 1 (Multisig protocol), even if your BSQ balance appears sufficient, a trade-fee payment can fail due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Minimum Fee Requirements**: There are absolute minimum fee thresholds for BSQ payments. For instance, the minimum fee to avoid dust is 0.03 BSQ. If your balance is below this threshold after attempting to pay the fee, the transaction will fail.\n\n2. **Network Congestion**: If the Bitcoin network is congested, the fee required for confirmation can increase. If your chosen fee is too low, the transaction may not get confirmed in a timely manner, causing the payment to fail.\n\n3. **Insufficient Adjusted Balance**: If you are using BSQ from a transaction that is still unconfirmed, it can reduce the effective balance available for fees.\n\nFor specific guidance or troubleshooting, it's best to check your current fees and balances within the Bisq application.",
