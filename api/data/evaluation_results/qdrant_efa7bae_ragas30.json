      "ground_truth": "Bisq 2 currently minimizes persistent historical stats for privacy by design; overview values may reflect limited current-profile/session context rather than full long-term trade history.",
      "answer": "In Bisq Easy (Bisq 2), if the overview shows zero total buying or selling despite completed trades, it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Reputation Requirements**: You may not be able to see trades if they involve users with zero reputation, as Bisq Easy restricts trading with such users.\n\n2. **Trade Status**: If trades are still in progress or haven't been finalized, they might not be reflected in the total count.\n\nIf you're experiencing inconsistencies, ensure that your application is updated and check your trade history for any pending actions.",
