      "ground_truth": "Bisq 2 currently minimizes persistent historical stats for privacy by design; overview values may reflect limited current-profile/session context rather than full long-term trade history.",
      "answer": "In Bisq 2 (Bisq Easy), the overview may show zero total buying or selling even when trades were completed due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Reputation Requirement**: If you are trying to trade with users who have a reputation of zero, you won't be able to buy from them, which may lead to an impression of no available trades.\n2. **Trade Status**: Completed trades may not immediately reflect in the overview if there is a delay in updating the interface or if the trades are not finalized correctly.\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent issues, ensure your application is updated and consider checking your network connection or restarting the app.",

      "question": "Why can BSQ balance appear sufficient but trade-fee payment still fail in Bisq 1?",
      "ground_truth": "Fee payment requires spendable BSQ UTXOs and correct fee context (for example BSQ swap vs fiat-trade fee path). Stale wallet state or fragmented/unspendable outputs can trigger insufficient-balance errors.",
      "answer": "In Bisq 1 (Multisig protocol), even if your BSQ balance appears sufficient, a trade fee payment may fail due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Minimum Fee Requirement**: There is a minimum fee required to avoid dust, which is 0.03 BSQ. If your balance does not exceed this amount after accounting for transaction fees, the payment will fail.\n\n2. **Market Fluctuations**: BSQ trading fees are adjusted regularly to maintain a discount against BTC fees. If the market rate for BSQ fluctuates significantly, the amount required for fees might exceed your balance.\n\n3. **Pending Transactions**: If you have unconfirmed transactions affecting your BSQ balance, it may not be sufficient to cover the fee at the time of the trade.\n\nThese factors can affect your ability to successfully pay trading fees with BSQ.",
