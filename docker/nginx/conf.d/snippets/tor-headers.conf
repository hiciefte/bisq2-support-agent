# Tor-specific headers (placeholder until Tor is configured)
# This file will be updated by scripts/setup-tor.sh when Tor is enabled
# Until then, this is an empty placeholder to prevent nginx errors

# Onion-Location header will be added here after Tor setup:
# add_header Onion-Location $onion_location always;
